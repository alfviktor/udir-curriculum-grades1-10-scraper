{"text": "William Randolph Hearst: Hello. And welcome to how to take over the world. This has been Wilson. And today we are talking about William Randolph Hearst. He was really the first media mogul, the first person with a big multi-million dollar media empire. His was primarily a newspaper business, but he also got into film, radio and a number of other businesses as well. And obviously as a podcast or media, something that I am interested in. So this episode is a little bit selfish as I was reading the story. You'll hear that I'm kind of reverse engineering in my brain, how to build a really successful media business. So if that's something that's interesting to you. If you're engaged in media, if you're an influencer, a producer, a writer and editor, a celebrity, a media executive. , William Randolph Hearst was all of those things. So this is going to be the perfect episode for you. And it's also to me, a really interesting story of power. I'm giving you a little bit of a spoiler here, but there's this interesting story. Where in Cuba tensions are boiling between the Spanish government, which owned Cuba at the time and the native Cubans who wanted to be independent. And there were some skirmishes and it's looking like things are at a boiling point. So William Randolph Hearst who owns a New York newspaper, sends a reporter to Havana. The reporter gets there to fan out the capital of Cuba and he writes back to her complaining, you know, there's all kinds of overblown. There's no actual fighting going on. Things have calmed down. There's nothing really exciting to report on. And the reporter he's actually also an illustrator writes back and says, can I come back to New York? You know, there's nothing to do here. And her says, no, stay. And he says, you furnish the pictures and I will furnish the war. And within months, the United States was at war with Spain over Cuba. Now it is a slight exaggeration to say that Hurst is the one who caused the Spanish American war. But, you know, at the time people believed that to be true. People believed the, he was the main force behind this war, the Spanish American war. And there are still people who believe that he was a major force behind. He was a major force behind it. .

{"text": ". People believed the , he was the main force behind this war , the Spanish American war . And there are still people who believe that he was a major force behind . He was a major force behind it . . In a democracy , the government is William Randolph Hearst: supposed to reflect the will of the people, the citizens, their desires, what they want. But what is it that they want and who is it that determines what they want? , the will of the people is not this freestanding independent thing that can't be influenced. Obviously not right. Many things have an impact on popular opinion and nothing more so than news media. People have always known this. People still know this is why Jeff Bezos bought the Washington post or why Elon Musk bought Twitter, um, which is of course also a major source of news. So this is a story about how to become a media mogul, but also about how to turn that position of influence into power. So let's get into it. Part one on the life of William Randolph Hearst after this quick break. üìç Speaking of becoming a media mogul. If you're interested in media, if you're a creator or interested in becoming a creator, I've got a great resource for you. It's called creative elements. It's a podcast that goes behind the scenes with today's top creators. The host is Jay Klaus, and I know Jay, he's a great guy. He's super smart on this kind of stuff. He's interviewed guests like Tim urban, James clear Tori Dunlap and Cody Sanchez. He recently did an episode with Chris Williamson that I really loved. I thought it was one of the best things I've ever listened to in terms of how to become a really successful podcaster. So you can think of creative elements a little bit like how I built this, but for digital creators, through highly produced narrative interviews, Jay dyes, into the specifics of how these creators are building their audiences today. So, you know, if you're coming to how to take over the world to learn some of these timeless principles of how people did it in the past with creative elements, you're going to learn some of these tactics of what's working on the cutting edge right now. By learning how these creators earning a living off their art and creativity. You'll gain the tools and confidence to become a smarter creator. So if you're building your own creative business, You should subscribe and listen to creative elements right here in your favorite podcast player. üìç William Randolph Hearst probably had the best childhood I've ever heard of.

{"text": "should subscribe and listen to creative elements right here in your favorite podcast player . üìç William Randolph Hearst probably had the best childhood I ' ve ever heard of . I certainly think he is who I ' m most jealous of in terms of , when you talk William Randolph Hearst: about childhoods, he was born in 1863 to Phoebe and George Hearst. And George Williams' father. Is a really interesting guy in his own, right. He could have his own episode of how to take over the world. He's born in Missouri. And, uh, his dad has a very small mind. He doesn't make a lot of money off of mining. But George, his son learns the business of mining and so 1849 happens. There's the gold rush to California. And George goes out to California and he uses that knowledge that he has. To be smart about mining and strikes. It rich becomes a kind of minor millionaire in the gold rush in San Francisco. So William Randolph Hearst is born in San Francisco to a fairly wealthy family in 1863. And I say I'm jealous because you think about it. It's California. The weather is perfect. It's about 20 years after the gold rush. San Francisco is the United States ninth, largest city. So it has all the amenities, culture, art that you could want. But it's still the wide open west. It's not fully filled in. It's not fully developed. It's not too crowded. And William. Uh, gets to enjoy this he's unbelievably doted on by servants, by maids and most of all by his mother. Uh, she just is obsessed with her son, William. This is a common theme, actually. Interestingly enough, a lot of these men are just like spoiled mama's boys, their mothers dote on them, like nothing else. And I don't know if that's because. Doting helps them become great. I kind of doubt that. I think it's maybe more just that these are extremely charming people. They charm their mothers who can't help, but dote on them. So, I don't know where it comes from, but this certainly falls into a pattern. Phoebe Hearst is obsessed with her son. He can't get enough of him. And part of that is because he's an only child. She actually wants more children. But George is like a true mining, man. He's always going all over the country. He's in Idaho. He's in Wyoming, Montana, Utah, all over the Western United States, Canada and Mexico. Looking for mines. And Phoebe actually follows him around a lot and is trying to get him to", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/william-randolph-hearst", "title": "William Randolph Hearst", "chunk_index": 2, "publication_date": "2023-03-10", "total_chunks_in_doc": 49}}

And Phoebe actually follows him around a lot and is trying to get him to William Randolph Hearst: have children with her, but they never managed to, and Williamson only child. Perhaps, because he almost never sees his father. William acts out for attention. And he's something of a prankster he's always getting into trouble. He throws a cobblestone through his dancing instructors window. He ties a string of lights around the tail of a neighbor's cat. And imagine this before electric lights. So I think this is like candles that he's tying around his neighbor's cat's tail. He takes a toy cannon. Which is supposed to be just a toy. But he fills it with real gunpowder and he shoots a pigeon from his hotel window. So he's a major prankster and is often getting into trouble as a kid. This is another common theme, by the way, if you remember Steve jobs, famous prankster as a kid, Thomas Edison, always doing these pranks with electricity. If you want to find where the really talented and successful people in an industry are, look for the pranksters. Common theme for whatever reason. So through all this, the hearse are rich, but not that rich. And they're a little bit boomer bust. Or there are fortunes can go up and down. That changes when William is 10 years old. Um, in 1873, his mother takes him on an 18 month tour of Europe. He learns French and German. And becomes obsessed with trying to collect antiques. , it's a great trip, but when they get back. They find that they do not have a house. George lost everything in a bad mining deal and they have to go take up at a boarding house. That's a nice boarding house. It's not like they're homeless. But still no more servants? Uh, no, no more nannies. It's a big change for them. And they're not poor. , How do I explain this? They are still in a certain social class, right? So they're not poor. They're broke. There's a difference, right? Between poor and broke. So they're broke for the next three years. They basically have no money. And then again, it's really more like four or five years later when William is 14 or 15, George finally strikes it. Big big. So if before they were minor millionaires, now they are.

They are one of the richest families in the United States . He has more William Randolph Hearst: money than you could ever want in your entire life. So yeah, their lives change at that point. So William, , when the time comes, is able to go to Harvard because they're, upper-class now. And as a freshman at Harvard, you can tell, okay, this guy is special. He rises to the top of the best clubs, clubs. Are something that's really big at Harvard, a big part of the social scene there. And back then, There was no like, oh, this club's a little different. I like this vibe. I'll choose this club. No, the clubs were actually ranked top to bottom. So the best clubs and the worst clubs and everyone wanted to get into the best clubs. And so William is able to navigate his way. To the top of the very best clubs at Harvard and part of the way that he does this is by spending an extravagant amount of money. He parties a really hard. He keeps the alcohol flowing for all his friends, anyone who wants to come to his apartment and party. Is free and welcome to do so. He also spends liberally on the university itself. So Harvard is different at this time from, from what it is now, you don't have all these official organizations. So for example, the crew team, the baseball team, the football team, These are all funded by the student body. And these are people just, you know, students chipping in money. And then the players go out and buy themselves uniforms. It's not tightly controlled and regulated. Like the NCAA is now in college sports. And so William, as a student with a very rich father is the top booster, the top funder of many of these sports. So that's his freshman year. He gets involved in all this stuff, gets into the best clubs and does very well academically. His sophomore year. One of the main things he does is he takes over at the Harvard Lampoon. Which is a comical newspaper at Harvard. It's known even today as a very famous comedic newspaper. Has a very long storied history and William Randolph Hearst is a big part of that history. , when he showed up, it actually was not this great thing. , his quote about it is that it was always late and not always funny.

And he ' s expected to fund the paper as the president of the William Randolph Hearst: newspaper. And he certainly has the resources to do that, but he doesn't want to, he actually wants to turn it around so it doesn't need funding. And he goes out, he sells more subscriptions to alumni. He pounds the pavement to get more sales for ads to carry in the newspaper. He improves the writing by finding good writers to make sure that it's actually funny and that it comes out on time and that people want it. And so he goes out and start talking to more advertisers and he ends up increasing the revenue by 300% and increases the circulation by 50%. So he comes into the Harvard Lampoon. It has a deficit of $200 and he takes it to a surplus of $650. As he started to see. Okay. You know, this is just a sophomore in college, but this is someone who knows how to run a media property, knows how to run a newspaper. And he does this very well. But maybe he does it too. Well, he he's so involved with all these various things that college that his academics really start to fail. He starts doing very poorly. And he kind of can't be bothered to care much. He's like a big man on campus. He's funding, all these things. He becomes the president of the inter collegiate baseball association. So like this big association, he's in charge of all the games that are happening. , All the college baseball games that are, that are happening essentially the United States. And so he doesn't really have time to study and he doesn't care to study. And, um eventually he gets put on suspension. And like I said, he can't be bothered to care. So he needs to study some more and take some tests to prove that he's ready to come back to Harvard and he just won't do it. He won't study. So eventually the faculty at Harvard say, okay, You're gone and they kick them out. Now while he was at Harvard. , two things that happened. One is he had started reading this newspaper, this new newspaper, New York called the world. Let's start by Joseph Pulitzer and it was kind of taking the newspaper scene by storm. , it was a different kind of newspaper than people had seen before. And he loves it.

And he ' s starting to get immersed , you William Randolph Hearst: know, between his experience of running the Harvard, Lampoon and reading the world. He starts to get excited about this newspaper business. And also at the same time his father had bought a newspaper called the San Francisco examiner out in San Francisco. Not really as an investment, it lost money every year, but he bought it because he was politically active, politically interested. He was the main Democrat out in California. The California was mostly a Republican state at the time, but George Hearst. Is sort of the democratic party in California and newspapers were a great way to organize support, get your voice out there. So George buys the San Francisco examiner. But he doesn't have time to do anything with it. Right. He's a mining man. He's also in the state legislature. So he's just kind of. Letting this newspaper run itself. And it's not doing a good job of running itself. It's kind of a third rate newspaper. And William who was in the process of getting kicked out of Harvard thinks, well, this is a great opportunity so he starts reading his father's paper and he's not impressed with what he finds. He writes back to his dad. It is a positive insult to our readers to set before them such pictures of repulsive deformity as these and yet such abortions are not entirely out of place in an article that comes to a climax with a piece of imbecility. So detestable that it would render the death of the writer, justifiable homicide. So you can tell, this is someone who really cares about the content of this newspaper really cares about. , good writing and it really bothers him. That the examiner is so bad. So in 1886, it's a big year will turns 23. His father gets elected to the Senate. And at the same time will moves out to San Francisco to take over the examiner. Expectations were very low. It's a third rate newspaper in America's ninth, largest city. And it's being taken over by a billionaires Playboy son. And will was a Playboy. When he comes back, he moves to Sausalito, which is across the bay from San Francisco, it's across the golden gate bridge today. But of course at the time, The golden gate bridge hadn't been built yet. So he actually has to sail to work every day. He's living with a waitress who he met in Cambridge.

She was. Uh, one of these women who kind of, uh, like to come into the orbit of, of rich men and, , and get paid. So not a woman of good repute. And so he's living with her. He's sailing every day to San Francisco. And people think, all right, this Playboy guy, there's no way he's serious about this, but the newspaper men of San Francisco had no idea. What was about to hit them because will was not content to just be a Playboy who was babysitting a third-rate newspaper and waiting for his inheritance. He had some big plans for the examiner. We'll find out what those were after this quick break. üìç Hey, it's me, Ben. Do you want to talk to me personally and strategize about how you can apply the lessons from this podcast?

It actually still is and was back then too, and we'll want it to beat them. But that was going to be tough because they were a first rate operation with great reporting, strong financial backing from the wealthy D young family. Will's first move at the examiner. Is brilliant. He takes a look and realizes, all right, it's going to take a lot of work before I can get on the level of the Chronicle. So how do I jumpstart things? So, what he does is he licenses content from a big New York newspaper, the New York Herald. So now he's getting top rate news from the east coast. And makes them seem", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/william-randolph-hearst", "title": "William Randolph Hearst", "chunk_index": 7, "publication_date": "2023-03-10", "total_chunks_in_doc": 49}}

So now he ' s getting top rate news from the east coast . And makes them seem William Randolph Hearst: like a top newspaper, right? He's getting this great reporting. No one had actually done this before. Everyone had just done their own original reporting. No one else was licensing content from other east coast newspapers. So the fact that he's carrying articles from a New York paper with offices all over the world. Makes people say, okay, this is cool. This is something different. And so, Readership goes, it goes way up. The Chronicle sees this and says, okay, we've got a copy of this kid. We can't let him just beat us this way. So they also start licensing content. , from a New York newspaper, they contract with the world, which I had already talked about. , and so the Chronicle. , contracts with the world and that makes them once again, kind of the juggernaut right there, the biggest San Francisco newspaper, and they are contracted with the biggest New York newspaper. So this strategy has a vaulted Hurst up to second place in San Francisco, but he's still well behind. So that's when he gets to work really pushing forward with his own original content, he makes the headlines bigger, catchier, more salacious, more kind of what today we might call clickbait. But it's not just clickbait. He's also increasing the quality of the cartoons, the illustrations, getting better printing presses to make the tight neater and more attractive. He starts experimenting with original reporting in new and interesting ways. He does stunt reporting. When a hospital is supposedly abusing patients, he has one of his reporters fake a leg injury and get admitted to the hospital and comes back and reports that indeed this hospital was neglecting and abusing their patients. So he's doing this kind of stuff. He's also experimenting with different stories to see what catches on. And ends up finding out that crime really moves papers. You've probably heard the saying, if it bleeds, it leads. And that Hurst definitely believed that. So crime stories go from 10% of the examiners headlines when he takes over to then 26% by the end. The other big thing, he does probably the most important thing he does. Is he starts to acquire. Unbelievable talent. And he's paying them 50% more than the Chronicle. So anytime that he sees a great writer, Or he reads anything and thinks, wow, I love that. He goes out and, uh, it's funny.

He ' s like William Randolph Hearst: collecting these people. His whole life. He was a great collector. He loved to collect antiques and paintings. I'm an art. And for him. I think these. , For him, I think. These writers were art and he liked to collect them as well. So he's collecting some of these great writers, not only in California, but throughout the United States. And you can see how much it matters to them. There's this one story. One of the great writers, he's this kind of reckless guy. , who loves to criticize the government in California and he lives out in Oakland. Which is across the bay from San Francisco. And the bay bridge, which connects San Francisco to Oakland today did not exist yet. So it's kind of a hike to get out to Oakland. You have to take the ferry and it's a whole big process. And this writer is in his house in Oakland and someone knocks at the door and it's this kid. And he walks up and says, Hey kid, what do you want? And he says, I come from the examiner. I want to talk to you about a writing job. And this writer says, oh, you come from Mr. Hearst. And he says, I am Mr. Hurst. And he can't believe it because no one expects the owner of the newspaper to come all the way out to Oakland. To talk to this guy to try and hire him. , but he loved writing. And that was the most important thing to him to have great content. And it gave him an advantage because, you know, because Michael D. Young, who is a millionaire and owns the Chronicle, I can guarantee you that the owner of the San Francisco Chronicle was not going out to Oakland to visit writers, to try and recruit them to his newspaper. So something that gives her some advantage that he cares so much. And the results of this are astounding. He discovers and helps promote some of the greatest writers in American history. So he discovers Jack London. He discovers Ambrose Bierce he's not as well-known as Jack London, but, also a great writer. , he definitely didn't discover mark Twain, but he was early in his career and really helped boost him. So look, I think one of the reasons that Hearst consistently won. Is that. He loved. The game for the sake of it. He loved newspaper as an art.

He loved newspaper as an art . He William Randolph Hearst: loved writing. He wasn't just doing it for the money. Another thing that he does is use his dad's position and wealth to advance the business. So in one instance, He wants the newspaper to go to places other than San Francisco. So nearby communities, towns, cities like Sacramento, a little farther north Monterey, a little further south. And so in order to get his newspapers distributed to these other towns and cities, he needs help. He needs them to be carried on the train on the railroad. But the trains won't carry the newspaper. I couldn't find out exactly why I think it's either. You know, trains were full. They didn't have enough room or maybe they already had a deal with the Chronicle. And maybe they had like a non-compete clause. Like they couldn't carry the examiner. But they're saying we won't carry it for whatever reason. And so he complains to his dad and says, dad, you know, the other Senator is Leland, Stanford, the guy who owns the trains. So can you talk to Stanford and get my newspaper on these trains so we can start to distribute it elsewhere? So dad talks to Stanford and he makes it happen. In another instance, he looks around and realizes, Hey. All these big businesses in San Francisco. Our advertising with the Chronicle and not with the examiner. And that's pretty messed up. Cause my dad's pretty important that they probably own favors. And so he writes to his dad and he says, and this is a quote. As these sons of bitches are principally indebted to you for whatever they have. I think that it is the goddamned as low down business I have ever heard of. I don't apologize for the swear words for, I think the circumstances, excuse them. Now, if you'll Telegraph a hot telegram to withdraw all your business from these firms. And not give them any more until they advertise in the examiner and not in the Chronicle. I think we can accomplish something. And of course his father obliges, and they're able to shake loose a lot of these advertisers and get some more money for the Chronicle. And so the effect of all this is that the newspaper slowly starts to gain on the Chronicle. And before long. People just can't deny anymore. The examiner is the best newspaper in San Francisco. It's better than the Chronicle.

It ' s better than the Chronicle . And then in 1890 , William Randolph Hearst: they finally surpassed them to become the top newspaper in California. And in 1890, they become profitable for the first time. For four years. William Hearst had just been burning money to create this amazing thing. He's paying these writers, all this money. And it's only four years later that it finally becomes profitable. This is a great business achievement for him to have become the biggest newspaper in San Francisco. But I think it's an even bigger artistic one. That's what he cared most about. One of his writers was a woman named Winnifred black. And here's what she had to say about this collection of great writers that worked at the San Francisco examiner. She said the examiner was a place full of geniuses. I love that quote, a place full of geniuses. Nowhere. Was there ever a more brilliant and more outrageous, incredible, ridiculous, glorious set of typical newspaper people than there was in that shabby old newspaper office. So I do think there's something to be learned there, which is you never lose. By spending whatever it takes to get all the best people under one roof. That's a strategy that seems to work. Time and time again. So in 1890 will has one San Francisco. But that year, everything changes. , his father dies. And when they opened the will. , he's embarrassed to hear that all of the money had been left to Will's mom, Phoebe. William Randolph Hearst receives zero inheritance. Now of course, that money is all going to come to him eventually when his mom dies, but as a vote of no confidence from beyond the grave from his father. There were a couple of reasons that his dad might have done this. One is this waitress who he lives with. Okay. That was always embarrassing to his parents and showed that maybe he was not ready to be mature, to grow up and be an adult. And then the other thing. Was his spending. So as I said, in 1890, the newspaper was finally profitable and very valuable, but he wasn't paying himself a salary. From the newspaper, he's actually still basically collecting an allowance, except for it's an allowance of like a million dollars a month. He's spending extravagantly. On his own life and his own lifestyle. And so his parents still kind of see him as a kid, even though he's having these successes.

He felt he needed to prove himself even further. He had one in the minor leagues in San Francisco. America's ninth, biggest city, but New York was the biggest. That was the major leaks. And now he's following a playbook that was set out by Joseph Pulitzer. Pulitzer was the biggest newspaper man in America. At the time he had started out in St. Louis and he had one St. Louis in the same way that will had one San Francisco he'd built up the biggest newspaper in St. Louis. And then he had decided to go over to New York and try to take over that industry. And he did he succeeded? As I said, the world became a sensation, became the biggest and best newspaper in the world. And others had since tried to copy that playbook. They had, you know, after they had become the biggest newspaper in their little provincial city, they'd moved to New York and tried to start a new newspaper to compete with the world. And basically all of them failed. And one of these people who had failed was a guy named McLean. And he had a newspaper called the New York morning journal. And it was not doing well. Uh, he basically had burned out and realized, all right, I can't do this. I can, I can't compete with Pulitzer. And so he decides to sell his, his newspaper and so Hearst, swoops in and buys it for $150,000. And just like in San Francisco, his chances look grim at first , the consensus. Of the newspaper men in New York was that Hurst had bought 11. Not just because it's a bad newspaper, but because come on. He's not going to be to compete here. Here's what one newspaper man wrote about the prevailing attitudes when Hearst came to New York. He said he was ridiculed for his youth and assurance and sneered at as a rich man's son rushing in where angels fear to tread. He was both pitied and jeered. When it leaked out that he had bought the journal. You got to understand that. The world was already cool and innovative. It was the greatest paper run by Joseph Pulitzer. Who was this wheeling and dealing hot shot.

Going to New York and trying to compete with the world would be like some young William Randolph Hearst: entrepreneur trying to think of what businesses start and deciding, you know, I'm going to start a search engine. I'm gonna go head to head with Google. . The guy uses that phrase where angels fear to tread, like you just didn't go toe to toe with Pulitzer. He beat everyone. He was shameless in his headlines. He was ruthless in his tactics. And he was really innovative in his reporting. The world was the best it was unassailable and everyone knew it. But Will's going to try anyway. He didn't believe any of that. So his first move when he gets to New York is to bring some of his best reporters and writers from San Francisco. One of the writers wrote that they were depressed to be moving east. You know, New York is supposedly the best city in the world, but they loved San Francisco. They love the freedom, the wide open spaces. And so they're not excited to be going to New York. But he wrote, we would've gone to the Fiji islands or Greenland's icy mountains. If the big chief had wanted to send us to either of those probably delightful, but rather remote places. So you can see from this, that his writers were incredibly loyal to him. They would have gotten. I see this guy saying they would've gone anywhere in the world for him. He appreciated their value. He paid them very well. And not only that, but he created a really great fun place to work and he pushed them to do their best work. They were accomplishing things at the San Francisco examiner, but they had never accomplished in their careers before. So, so they loved William Randolph Hearst. After bringing in some of his best writers, the next thing he does. Is who quickly looks at the situation and says, okay. I have to differentiate myself. I can't just be another really good newspaper. Because the world already exists and it's already good. So if I just do that, then I'm going to be the second great newspaper and no one's going to pay any attention. Why would I subscribe to the, to the journal if I'm already subscribed to the world? So, , he looks at it and says, okay, well, all the best newspapers. Charge 2 cents there to send papers. There were also 1 cent papers, but these were generally a low quality. Little rags. And so will says,", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/william-randolph-hearst", "title": "William Randolph Hearst", "chunk_index": 13, "publication_date": "2023-03-10", "total_chunks_in_doc": 49}}

Little rags . And so will says , William Randolph Hearst: okay. I'm going to fill this niche. Of being the only newspaper that is. As good as a 2 cent paper, that is a extremely high quality well-reported newspaper. But I'm only gonna charge 1 cent. So I'm going to be 2 cent quality paper, one set cost. And the only reason he can do this is because he's got his father's fortune, so he can afford to lose money for a number of years. And that's what we'll have to do. So he's dumping money into this paper that is. The cost as much as two sent papers to operate, but only has a price of 1 cent. So he goes through this strategy, it brings in his writers and it goes about using the same playbook as the examiner. He's trying to make the journal the best paper in town. He's writing better, bigger headlines than they had previously had improving the quality of the illustrations. Start poaching, really good writers from other newspapers in New York city. And, um, yeah, he's just generally creating a great paper. William always believed there was no substitute for quality, for great writing. And I say great writing, but there was sort of this interesting dichotomy of on the one hand. Like, like Jack London. , mark Twain, like great literary prose in these newspapers. And great journalists doing great reporting. While at the same time, there's all this typical yellow journalism stuff of like sensationalizing stories, exaggerating them sometimes just making stuff up, doing these totally bombastic click baity headlines. And, , I guess William Randolph Hearst never saw any contradiction in this. He did. The stuff that he had to do. . In order to get eyeballs on the paper. And then once you really got into that paper, that's where you would find the great writing and the great recording. , so he's doing that. He's doing both at the same time and really bringing up the level of the journal. He's making it impossible to ignore, and he is. Making up ground because of his strategy he's gaining , on the world. And as he's doing this, he's making a splash. Everyone's paying attention to him. And Pulitzer freaks out. And so he makes one huge mistake. And that is he's looking at the journal and it's rising.

{"text": "he ' s making a splash . Everyone ' s paying attention to him . And Pulitzer freaks out . And so he makes one huge mistake . And that is he ' s looking at the journal and it ' s rising . And he gets nervous and he William Randolph Hearst: says, okay. Well, Then, I guess we have to adopt their strategy. We also have to be a 1 cent newspaper in order to go in and snuff them out. And you can see the logic, right? The only reason that people are going to the journal over the world, this is a 1 cent paper, same, same level of quality, but it's a 1 cent paper. But what he doesn't consider is that once he does this, he doesn't have the high ground anymore. He can no longer claim to be, you know, the old storied world. . The indisputed best newspaper in the world. No, he's getting down on their level. And William Randolph Hearst really seizes on this. Uh, he, he puts out a big editorial. And says, uh, it's called a reluctant convert. And says welcome to the arena of the one sent papers, you know, , so nice of you to take inspiration from us, so nice of you to copy us. And that is what it looks like. It looks like the world is copying the journal and now it seems like the journal is the world's leading newspaper. It's it's the one that is setting the agenda and that people are copying. And so actually when people answer does this. Uh, , Hurst can see that. Wow. They're weak right now. I'm going to move in for the kill. And that's what he does. He goes straight for their throat. He starts hiring. All of the best writers from the world. And he's telling these people. I will pay you whatever I have to pay you to get over to the examiner. And when I say all the best writers, I mean, he is hiring tons of people from the world. And he's able to do so. Uh, not just because he's paying tons of money because whenever he does this, actually Pulitzer comes in and says, I will pay you guys. Whatever Hurst offers I'll match it. But. Pulitzer was not able to create the same. Work environment. The Hurst was pilots or like things to revolve around him. He liked to be able to hire and fire people at will. He thought he was the genius. He was the one who came up with the headlines. He was the one who came up with the strategy.

And so he didn ' t value writers in the same William Randolph Hearst: way that Hearst did. And so they could tell, they were, could tell that they were replaceable. And Hurst is offering them these long multi-year contracts. He's saying not only will I pay you well, but I'll pay you well for a long time. I really value you. You're going to be here for a long time. Give you all the stability that you want. And so all these writers say yes, And he, so we pilfer is the world and brings all these great writers to the journal. One newspaper at this time wrote that they wouldn't be surprised if the labor authorities got involved. They said, quote, he is a monopolist of talent. Whenever he sees a brilliant intellect sparkle. He wishes to wear it on the bosom of the journal. And so at this point, Pulitzer. I can see which way the wind is blowing. And so he fully goes into alright. We're just going to copy everything that hurts. Does. And so he actually starts looking around for a spy. Um, he starts offering a bounty, anyone who works at the office of the journal, who's willing to come spy for us. And so he gets some spies inside the journal. He starts copying him exactly in everything. So there's this one yellow cartoon character that is in the journal. Pilzer. Hires at different artists too. Draw cartoons of the exact same character. So, this is actually when the term yellow journalism, comes into, into play because there are two newspapers that are running the same cartoon of this little yellow guy. And so they all have this yellow guy on their front page. That's called yellow journalism. Now, all of this kind of bring Hearst and Pulitzer into a tie. The journal is on the level of the world. But then there are two things that break that tie. The first is the campaign of William Jennings, Bryan. Brian was this real firebrand fiery speaker. It's radical leftist. He's kind of a prodo socialist. And he was a Trump-like figure in many ways. He was very popular with a lot of people who felt marginalized. Frankly popular with many of the same people with whom Trump was popular. He was a firebrand, a great public speaker, and he was taboo amongst high society. He was persona non grata, endorsing, or being affiliated with him was social suicide. Now William Jennings, Bryan is a Democrat. And both the world and", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/william-randolph-hearst", "title": "William Randolph Hearst", "chunk_index": 16, "publication_date": "2023-03-10", "total_chunks_in_doc": 49}}

Now William Jennings , Bryan is a Democrat . And both the world and William Randolph Hearst: the journal we're democratic papers. But because he was so controversial, basically every New York democratic paper did not endorse him. In 1896. , they all declined to do so, except for William Randolph Hearst and the journal Hurst decides that. He's a democratic paper. And so he's going to stand for the Democrat. And there's intense pressure not to do this. Advertisers pull their advertising. All his wall street buddies are complaining and saying this, this is horrible. You can't do this. Hearst. Uh, later ran an editorial in the journal that read editorial guns, raked us business guns shattered us popular guns, battered us. And above the din and flame of battle, the curses of the wall street crowd that hated us advertisers called on me and said they would take out every advertisement. If I continued to support Brian. And I told them to take out their advertisements as I needed more space in which to support him. So you can see how passionate he is. These advertisers say, look, man, if you don't stop supporting Brian, we're going to cancel our ads. He says, cancel your ads. I need more space to support Brian with. So he's very intransigent about this. And this does lead to a short term loss in advertising revenue, but it leads to a huge uptick in the number of subscribers. They're getting a massive number of scribers at this time. And there are two reasons for that. One is William Jennings. Bryan was very popular with a certain crowd, especially the working class. And there's only one newspaper that supports him. And so of course, if you support William Jennings, Bryan, you're going to go subscribe to the journal. And then the other thing is that even people who didn't necessarily love William Jennings, Bryan. You know, they maybe weren't huge fans. They still wanted to follow what was happening with his campaign. Again, it's a little bit like the Trump phenomenon. If you remember, in 2016, it definitely was not only Fox news that was covering Trump. CNN MSNBC, nonstop. We're covering Trump because everyone wants to know. What will this guy say next? And so that is happening here. People want to follow the Brian campaign, even if they aren't supporters. And there's only one place where they can go to get that information.

{"text": "next ? And so that is happening here . People want to follow the Brian campaign , even if they aren ' t supporters . And there ' s only one place where they can go to get that information . And that ' s because the journal had great William Randolph Hearst: access to the William Jennings Bryan campaign. Because they were the only. Newspaper who endorsed him. And so what ended up happening is they were basically. , the Brian campaign's headquarters in New York, you know, they essentially worked hand in hand with the Brian campaign. They had all the latest and best information about his campaign. And so lots of people were very interested in this. William Jennings, Bryan ends up losing the election, but even afterwards it represents kind of a shift. For the New York journal. And it's a shift from being just a normal newspaper. To being. Almost like an activist organization. It's a little difficult to explain. But, so for example, Uh, this is the age of trusts and monopolies and a lot of corruption in the United States. And in one of these instances of corruption, There is a contract that gets given out in New York city to this well-connected guy. And he's supposed to tear up a street and install some gas mains, but these gas mains are totally unnecessary. Those guys can tear up a street and fill it in again for no reason whatsoever, other than it's just a contract to put some money in his pocket. So the journal hires a lawyer and goes to the Supreme court and files an injunction to have this process stopped and it does, it works. And so of course they report on it and they report on themselves as the heroes of this story. , around this time they adopt the motto while others talk. The journal acts. And so they're not just reporting the news. They're making the news. And that's very important because it generates exponentially. More interest than just reporting on the news. So that is one thing that starts to vault the journal ahead of the world. And then the other thing is the Spanish American war. Which I referenced a little bit at the beginning. So there had been simmering discontent in Cuba. Uh, the Spanish owned the country of Cuba. And the Cubans were interested in independence. So there's a revolution. Uh, in 1868 and then it doesn't really go anywhere. It's kind of simmering for a long time. And then in 1895, It really starts to break out. And, um, that's because of some economic factors and economic headwinds in Cuba. So there's a lot of discontent there are minor skirmishes with the government. And so Spain cracks down. They send in the", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/william-randolph-hearst", "title": "William Randolph Hearst", "chunk_index": 18, "publication_date": "2023-03-10", "total_chunks_in_doc": 49}}

They set up concentration camps, people are dying. It looks horrible. And the journal is breathlessly reporting. This whole thing. And it looks like. A full-scale civil war could break out in Cuba at any time. And her son immediately seizes on this. He sends a reporter in 1895. This is the famous story that I told at the beginning of the reporter going and writing back and saying, Hey, nothing's going on? And he says, Hey, you furnished the pictures, all furnished the war. And I think what he's actually talking about is not that he's going to cause the United States to get into war with Spain. You basically saying we'll make up the stories. Not that I have a way to manage, to get the U S government into this war on my own. Will he didn't quite have that level of power. But as I said, this is a story about power and this is the time when William Randolph Hearst starts to think, okay, what power do I have? What can I get away with? So, for example, he's reporting on these stories in Cuba. And one of them, he reports on this outrageous story of this woman. , Angelina Ceros. She's the daughter of a rebel captain. And supposedly some Spanish officers sees her think she's pretty. And he tries to seduce her. And, um, She rejects his advances and he tries to force himself on her and she runs away. And so, as a consequence, this officer has her arrested and thrown in jail. And so this is a great story, right? He loved to put beautiful women in distress on the cover of his newspapers. So. Look at this innocent woman who's in jail because she wanted to keep her virtue and resisted the advances of this despicable Spanish officer. It's a great story. So they make a huge deal about it. And then he decides, remember other stock, but journal ax. So he decides he's going to act. So he sends one of his reporters to Cuba. Gives them a bunch of money and says, Hey, see what you can do. To free this woman, Angelina Saras. And so he uses the money. He bribed some officers, he bribed some guards. And manages to smuggle her out of Cuba.

And so she comes to New York and of course , William Randolph Hearst dresses her up like a princess in William Randolph Hearst: this white dress and parades her around the city in a literal parade in New York. And this is a genius move. I mean, think of the amount of self promotion. But this generates for, for Hearst and for the journal, it's just, it's unbelievable. It's a master stroke. Now it doesn't immediately come to war. This situation is simmering and Cuba for years. And then finally in 1898. The United States sends a battleship called the USS Maine. To Havana to the capital of Cuba. There were a lot of economic ties. That Americans had in Cuba, a lot of Americans owned businesses, owned farms, many Americans live there. So they say, okay, we're just going to send a battleship. , to hang out in the Harbor in Havana. To, to make sure that Americans in Cuba are okay. And then on February 15th, 1898. The USS Maine. Blows up. Completely explodes. And he kills 250 sailors on board. It's the middle of the night. When William Randolph Hearst finds out via telephone. He's at home. He picks it up. Obviously he knows he was getting called in the middle of the night. It's big news. So he says, okay, what's the big news. What's so important that you woke me up. And they say. The battleship Maine has been blown up in Havana Harbor. And he says. Good heavens. What have you done with the story? We've put it on the front page. Of course. Have you put anything else on the front page? Only the other big news. And then William says there is no other big news. Please spread the story all over the page. This means war. Initially the president, president McKinley is cautious. It's unclear what caused the USS Maine to blow up. It could have been just an accidental fire that lit off some ammunition inside the ship. So it blew up. , or the other likely scenario was a Spanish mine. If it was a Spanish mine, it was probably an accident. I mean, it seems to stretch the imagination that the Spanish. Would intentionally. Blow up the ship because you know, for the Spanish, the worst possible outcome. Is that the United States of America who gets involved? So it was probably either an accidental mine. Or an accidental explosion onboard the ship. We actually still don't know.

Uh, what happened? And it takes them a while to investigate and every day. They're investigating. Hers is, killing president McKinley in the newspaper saying, you know, Americans are dead and look at this coward who won't avenge them, who won't go to war with Spain. And so there is this immense pressure. It's not just from Hearst, but Hurst is definitely the loudest voice. And calling for war in Cuba. And then the Naval commission comes back and they say, We can't know for sure. But it definitely is possible. That it could have been a mine. And that's enough. To kind of set off alarm bells everywhere. Even still president McKinley and some level heads are trying to see if there's a diplomatic solution with Spain. So they enter into negotiations. But they can't come to an agreement. And so on April 21st. McKinley asks for war authorization. And Congress gives it to him. Interestingly, once war breaks out. One of the most fascinating things. William Randolph Hearst. Tries to conduct his own war. So. The Spanish have a number of colonial possessions to their biggest ones are Cuba. And the Philippines over in the Pacific. So they've got these two different theaters of war and they're trying to move warships between the two. And, there's the thought that some of those are going to go through the Suez canal. The Suez canal is in Egypt. It's what gets you from the Mediterranean out towards Asia? And so Hearst has this idea. He wants to see if he can go take one of his yachts. And sync it. In the Suez canal to delay the Spanish for moving their fleet through, through the canal and being able to come and move a fleet that was an Asia over to the Atlantic theater to fight in Cuba. But, I mean, it's just really interesting that he's even thinking like that. Like how can I personally use my resources to help wage war on Spain? He runs a headline less than a week afterwards, declared that reads. How do you like the journals war? So this isn't just, you know, hindsight where people are saying that William Randolph Hearst started this war. He's actively trying to encourage this idea that he's the one that started the war.

But they're going to cover the war. Of course. And I always love how to take over the world crossovers and we get one here. This is the first time that Hearst starts working with the Edison company. To produce motion, pictures, movies. Of the war. And so her sends a bunch of journalists, photographers and cartoonists over to Cuba, and a few guys that he contracts with from the Edison company. To document everything about this new Spanish American war. At some point, people start teasing him, like, all right. You're so anxious for the United States to send all these boys over to go die in Cuba. You're only 35 William Randolph Hearst. You're not an old man. What are you doing? Why can't you go fight? And so he does ask president McKinley. Like, can I form my own outfit? Can I have my own little cavalry company and kind of go over there as mercenaries? And he says, no, if you're gonna go fight, you have to do it with the us army. And rehearsed is not about to go in list. So he doesn't go over as a soldier, but he does is he gets authorization to outfit a yacht. With guns and heads over as an armed war correspondent. So that's what he does. Uh, Hurst himself goes over with a bunch of journalists to Cuba shortly after arriving. He goes towards the front lines where they're trying to report. And they come to this area, they do not realize is a fortified Spanish position. And so the Spanish start shooting at them. And one of his journalists gets shot. And, uh, it's not life-threatening. He gets shot in the arm or the leg, but he's bleeding. Profusely and her skills over to him. And he treats the wound. It's kind of heroic. Right. But listen to what he says to him. This is, this is genuine obsession. And he goes over to his friend, this journalist who's been shot. And he says, this is a quote, sorry. You're hurt. But wasn't that a splendid fight. We're going to beat every paper in the world.

So like , even as his friend is shot and bleeding on the ground , All I can think about is man , this is William Randolph Hearst: going to make. The amazing newspaper tomorrow. . I mean hers, man. He was one of a kind. , another thing he does while he's there is he's on his battle yacht. As I like to call it. And they're kind of on the outside. Of the American Navy. Where a battle is about to take place there, sailing towards the Spanish Navy and there's can be a Naval battle. And the Navy says to him, Hey, can you beat it? You're not a worship about having an actual fight. Can you leave? And hers just says no. And hangs out on the outside of this battle. And so as the battle is kind of wrapping up, the Americans win a bunch of Spanish battleships have been blown up. And some sailors from the Spanish fleet have managed to swim to shore. And so Hearst takes his yacht. And sales over to the sailors and takes 29 Spanish soldiers as prisoners. And they're pretty happy to be taken as prisoner. , they just, you know, want to be. Dry and onboard and get some food. And so he takes them prisoner and eventually delivers them to the U S Navy to hold this prisoners. And so again, this makes a great news. And even other newspapers have to give him credit. I'm like, man, what a story, you know, while others talk, the journal acts. I mean, that's true for sure. They're involved in the war. They're taking Spanish prisoners. I mean, can you imagine that today? Can you imagine that Fox news or MSNBC reports? Yeah, we had some reporters in Afghanistan and they actually took 29 Taliban fighters as prisoners and turned them over to the U S government. And what kind of sensation. Would that cause, but what would you think of a journalistic organization that was capable of doing that? And so again, this key insight. Of William Randolph Hearst. Don't just report the news, make the news. That is when you generate the most attention. So, of course the United States is easily victorious in the Spanish American war. And the Hearst papers grow tremendously throughout the war. The journal has now surpassed the world and it's the biggest newspaper in New York and therefore the biggest newspaper in the world. And Hearst not only has the confidence that he is the best newspaper man.

But he ' s starting to think of himself as a man of destiny . William Randolph Hearst: Of the kind of guy who can take prisoners and free princesses in the middle of a war. So he comes home from Cuba, ready to make an even bigger impact on the world. So we'll talk about. What that impact is next episode. But for now to finish out, let's talk about some lessons. I mean to me, one of the big lessons is he's 35 years old. And he's doing all this stuff, but what's interesting is he still only got two newspapers. Yes, they're very big and very influential and great newspapers. But it's kind of remarkable for someone who, you know, ends up being known as this Titan of business, owning this huge conglomerate with all these media properties that it's been 10 years. That he's been in business and there's no conglomerate. There's just two newspapers. And to me. There's a lesson in that. I think people, when they start to get successful immediately, Want to expand. And other products, other mediums, other channels. I think that's particularly a temptation for creators. But you can see that. No, no, no. Her doubles down on his one or two best channels until they are absolutely dominant. And only then only once he's completely. Ahead of the field. Does he think about expanding. And so I think there's a lesson there. And then, you know, just to reiterate some of the other stuff I mentioned throughout. You have to be. A sicko. And absolute sicko. I think that's what Hearst is. His mother refers to his habit of collecting his love of art. As an affliction. It's like a disease. That's what she compares it to. And that's how he feels about great writing and great newspapers. He has an affliction. He can't help himself. He loves this, right? He can't help, but collect these great writers. He can't help, but want to make the absolute best content for his new, safer, no matter the cost. He is a sicko. For great content. And if you are not a sicko, if you're someone who is just in it for the money, you are never going to be able to compete. With the sickos for the people who are doing it for the love of the game. That was one of my big takeaways from meeting", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/william-randolph-hearst", "title": "William Randolph Hearst", "chunk_index": 24, "publication_date": "2023-03-10", "total_chunks_in_doc": 49}}
{"text": "if you ' re someone who is just in it for the money , you are never going to be able to compete . With the sickos for the people who are doing it for the love of the game . That was one of my big takeaways from meeting William Randolph Hearst: Mr. Beast, that guy. Loves YouTube, not just because it has made him a bunch of money. And he's done well with it. , but because he's a consumer as well, he's just a sicko like Hurst is he just loves to watch YouTube videos. So you have to have that sickness. If you want to be great. Other lessons when it comes to media. You have to spare no expense in making your content. The best. In some industries. There is room for luxury products and then Cheever ones, you have Rolex, and then you have Timex, but in media. You know, the cost of a newspaper is basically the same as any other paper. The cost of a movie ticket. Is the same, no matter what movie you're going to. And that's even more true nowadays, when most media is free. You know, my podcast costs the same as every other podcast, free 99. Uh, if you go to YouTube, basically every video costs the same as every other video on YouTube. They're all free. So if you're content. Is even just 5% worse than the competition. Then people are going to watch something else. It doesn't get any cheaper. So why would I watch worst content? So you have to spend whatever it takes to make the best stuff. If you want to get yours, if you want to get eyeballs. Another lesson is that it is never losing strategy to get all the best talent in industry and put them under one roof. But just, it seems to me. Whether it's apple, whether it's Nike. Whether it's the San Francisco examiner or the New York journal, it always works. And it's a big reason why Hurst was successful. Is he created a as when a few blacks said a place full of geniuses. And I think in order to create that kind of place. You have to create an environment where those kinds of people love to üìç be in love to work. Okay. Well, that is it for this week until next time. Thank you for listening to how to take over the world. ‚Äç Hello, and welcome to how to take over the world. This is Ben Wilson. This is part two on the life of William Randolph Hearst.

{"text": "world . This is Ben Wilson . This is part two on the life of William Randolph Hearst . And just to catch you up with where we were at in case you forgot . Last time we saw how William , who was the son of a wealthy California William Randolph Hearst: minor ends up taking over his father's failing newspaper in San Francisco. And ends up turning it around into a very successful and the biggest newspaper in San Francisco. And then he goes out to New York. He takes over a paper called the journal and makes it the most successful newspaper in New York. And when we had left off Hurst was just finished being a sort of armed war correspondent in Cuba during the Spanish American war. In part two, we'll examine the expansion of his media empire, dive into his politics and how he became one of the most important political figures of the 20th century. And of course through it all. We'll talk about how he did it, how he was so successful. I think this is an amazing story of someone who took money and turned it into power and influence. So we'll get into all that. But before we do, here's a brief word from one of our sponsors. So when William comes home from the Spanish American war home from Cuba. You might think that he would be ecstatic because it was a big success in terms of generating publicity, increasing readership of his newspapers. If you remember, he captures these Spanish prisoners and that makes him something of a hero. The reporting is first rate. Uh, it seems on the surface, like everything is going well, but he was not ecstatic or elated. When he came home, he was actually devastated. Here's what he had to say. I'm quoting a letter that he wrote to his mom. He said, I guess I'm a failure. I made the mistake of my life in not raising the cowboy regimen I had in mind before Roosevelt raised his, I really believe I brought on the war, but I failed to score in the war. I had my chance and failed to grab it. And I suppose I must sit on the fence now and watch the procession go by. It's my own fault. I was 35 years of age and of sound mind, comparatively, and could do as I liked, I failed and I'm a failure and I deserve to be for being a slow and stupid as I was outside of the grief that it would give you. It had better to be in a Santiago trench than where I am now. Okay. So very heavy stuff from William Randolph Hearst right there. I. I was dead. Mom sounds like a, like an emo kid. And what's getting him so emotional. So down", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/william-randolph-hearst", "title": "William Randolph Hearst", "chunk_index": 26, "publication_date": "2023-03-10", "total_chunks_in_doc": 49}}
{"text": "in a Santiago trench than where I am now . Okay . So very heavy stuff from William Randolph Hearst right there . I . I was dead . Mom sounds like a , like an emo kid . And what ' s getting him so emotional . So down William Randolph Hearst: about this. Well, it's not his own performance, which is actually great. It's seeing Teddy Roosevelt. And what he did during the Spanish American war. So Teddy Roosevelt wasn't much of anybody before this, but he had taken his rough riders regiment and made a national hero of himself by charging the Spanish on San Juan Hill and Hearst himself had first had the idea before the war to raise a volunteer regiment. And he had asked president McKinley who said no, and he didn't push it. He just let it go. And now he sees Roosevelt who he absolutely hates and loads becoming a hero and realizes that he had the same opportunity and missed it. And he understands that this is going to launch Roosevelt into national stardom, and he can probably already tell that he's headed for the presidency and that kills him. Because the truth of the matter is he wasn't trying to build a media empire just in order to have a business empire. This wasn't his primary objective to make money. He was trying to have influence and power, especially through politics. There's this line from Francis Ford Coppola. You can always understand the story of the son by the story of the father. Shout out to David Sandra who always uses that line. And sons are always trying to complete the unfinished business of their father. You see this in the life, for example, of George W. Bush, who feels that his father had unfinished business in Iraq. So he goes and invades Iraq. I know that's an oversimplification, but it certainly seems like that was at play in his psychology. And you see this with William Randolph Hearst as well. His father had come into politics a late in life had struggled for a long time as a Democrat in California and had not had much success until finally becoming a Senator. Right before he died prematurely, before his full political ambitions could be realized. And so Hearst kind of wants to complete those political ambitions. He wants to finish that unfinished business. He wants to be very influential politically and really, he wants to be president of the United States. So as a precursor to running for president, he needs his voice heard outside of California and New York, the current place where he has newspapers. So he establishes a newspaper in Chicago, the first democratic paper in the city. He actually has to bring in some gangsters to rough up the Newsboys cause they don't want to carry his paper. They're afraid to carry", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/william-randolph-hearst", "title": "William Randolph Hearst", "chunk_index": 27, "publication_date": "2023-03-10", "total_chunks_in_doc": 49}}
{"text": "he has newspapers . So he establishes a newspaper in Chicago , the first democratic paper in the city . He actually has to bring in some gangsters to rough up the Newsboys cause they don ' t want to carry his paper . They ' re afraid to carry William Randolph Hearst: the competitor of the biggest paper in town, the Chicago Tribune, which is pressuring them to not sell. Her paper, but you know, he brings in his muscle. They rough him up a little bit. They tell him, Hey, you better carry this paper. And all right, the Newsboys start selling. His Chicago paper as well. He implements his usual playbook in Chicago and immediately the paper starts doing really well boosted by the fact that it's the first democratic paper. People were kind of ready for it. So he wants to enter politics. He's got these newspapers, he's got money, he's got connections and friends inside the democratic party. And so he starts trying to find somewhere where he can fit in. And they end up getting him a congressional seat. He's basically appointed. And they have this big party machine that I've talked about called Tammany hall, which is a big center of. Politics get out the vote efforts, also corruption for Democrats in New York city. And so the Tammany bosses decide, okay, you can have the nomination for this democratic seat. And it's a very, very heavily democratic district. So whoever gets nominated, is he going to win? So. Here's the nomination. And he's a shoe-in. He doesn't have to campaign in the general election. He doesn't have to make a big show of it, make a big thing of it, but he does. He has these huge campaign rallies with fireworks, huge meals, outdoor parades, bans, and everywhere. He's talking about defending unions and the working man ending the trusts, which were these corrupt public monopolies that control public utilities, like water, ice, and gas. And in his biggest speech, he has these electric bulbs behind him. And remember, electric lighting is pretty new at this point. So he's got these electric lights that spell out. Congress must control the trust. And that was his big message and he was very on message. Very on brand control the trusts. And this works, it gets him a national profile. And it's very smart of him to build his profile before he runs for president. It essentially allows him to get his message out on a post. He's got the microphone in this district and no one is going to debate him or contradict them. So when the election comes, he cleans up his district even more than is normal for", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/william-randolph-hearst", "title": "William Randolph Hearst", "chunk_index": 28, "publication_date": "2023-03-10", "total_chunks_in_doc": 49}}
{"text": "essentially allows him to get his message out on a post . He ' s got the microphone in this district and no one is going to debate him or contradict them . So when the election comes , he cleans up his district even more than is normal for William Randolph Hearst: a Democrat. He wins in a huge, huge landslide victory. The only thing about Mars, this victory He has a big victory party near Madison square, and he has a huge fireworks display. And unfortunately those fireworks catch fire. They ignite all at the same time. , before they launch and they explode, which essentially creates a bomb. A dozen people are killed. And hundreds are maimed or wounded. The, you read the descriptions and it's like saving private Ryan. People are walking around bloody to maimed. People are missing arms and legs. It's awful. And so obviously this goes against his message, which is I'm for the working people. I'm the common man. And it's like, no, you're actually so rich. And so humoristic that you killed working men with your enormous extravagant, unnecessary fireworks this way, So that is a mark against him, but he tries to put it behind him. He goes off to Washington, DC and serves as a Congressman. Uh, he's very influential in large part because of all his money and his newspapers. And he creates a big stir around these very progressive issues of labor unions, workers rights, and busting the trust. The only flaw in this plan is that as he's doing this, he started sticking his thumb in the eye of the very people who helped get him elected in the first place, he's making an enemy of Tammany hall. Because they rely on these trusts to make their money. That's how they do their corruption. That's how they launder their money. It's through these big public monopolies. So he's, he's getting very popular in Congress, but he's also making some enemies. Well, he was never very patient and he always liked to move fast. So he decides to run for president only two years. After being elected to Congress. And of the people planning to run for president as Democrats. He's basically the only person who represents the radical William Jennings, Bryan wing of the party. If you remember William Jennings, Bryan is a firebrand who delivers very impassioned speeches. About working people, the forgotten man, and this is the wing that the democratic party is a little bit embarrassed of the people that they don't want to embrace. And so the democratic machine is not going to be very supportive of Hearst. So he starts to think, all right, well, why do I need these", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/william-randolph-hearst", "title": "William Randolph Hearst", "chunk_index": 29, "publication_date": "2023-03-10", "total_chunks_in_doc": 49}}

So he starts to think , all right , well , why do I need these William Randolph Hearst: people? Anyway, I have my newspapers. I can go directly to the people, the voters by publishing in my newspapers. So he makes kind of a Donald Trump appeal. He says, look, listen guys, I'm a rich businessman. I have all this money. I won't be beholden to anyone else. I won't need to do all this corruption so I can just do the right thing. I can fight for the people and not for the trust, not for big business, because I can afford to. And so that's his popular message. He wants to get it out to even more people. So while he's campaigning for president, he establishes newspapers in Los Angeles and Boston to help them get the message out there as well. Now has planned for the nomination is basically all right, I'm going to pick up all of William Jennings. Bryan's contingent of the party. And that's strongest in the west and in the Midwest. And then I'm from New York. So I can use the journal, my newspaper to pick up support in New York. And that should be a winning coalition. That should be enough. And at first, this seems to work. His message is deeply unpopular. With businesses with financial interests, with those who tend to supply the money that supports the democratic party, but it's very, very popular with the voters and he's gaining more and more support. In the last episode, I compared William Jennings, Bryan to Donald Trump. And this is kind of toxic personality with a radical message. But in many ways, William Randolph Hearst is even more like Trump. He's an outsider businessman with questionable morals who absolutely dominates every new cycle with a radical message that is completely. Uh, wrong anathema, inappropriate to proper society. Right? If you go do a cocktail party in New York and you say I'm a big Trump supporter. Uh, imagine the kind of reaction you're going to get. That is the kind of reacting you would've got. If you have said. I'm I'm a big Hearst supporter. And similar to Donald Trump. He is a genius of self promotion and he's kind of creating this cult of personality. So. There are a lot of people, especially powerful people who just hate him. I can't stand him.

The rest of the media can ' t stand him , but he also has these William Randolph Hearst: really, really fanatical supporters as well, who will do anything for him? So the comparisons are very strong between hirsutism and kind of Trumpism. And so similar to when Trump for sort of running in 2015, people are freaking out saying, we've got to stop this guy at all costs. He's horrible. He's going to destroy America. He's going to destroy the Republic. One of the main things that they try and hit him with is his reputation as a Playboy. They're like, oh, he's going to have poker games and boxing matches in the white house. You know, remember he lived with a waitress and San Francisco. And he actually had just married a woman. Her name was Millicent Wilson. But she was a chorus girl. Right? So, uh, not, not exactly the stuff that first ladies were usually made of. So they're attacking his personal life. They're attacking his rabble rousing radical left wing politics. But they can't stop them. His message is just so appealing. So in the first primary, which back then was Rhode Island. He wins six of eight delegates. So he wins the first primary. And then he starts winning more and more primaries. And he's the front runner and it looks like he's had a victory for the nomination, for the presidency in 1904. And then they get to New York and New York is home state. You know, supposedly he should do well in New York. He's got a lot of support there. A lot of people love the journal. He's got fanatical, radical sport. The problem is New York is the center for corruption in the democratic party, right? This is where Tammany hall is located. And it's the place where they're handing out all these corrupt contracts, these trusts. And so he's really alienated these party bosses. They have this big, get out the vote machinery, you know? Vote early vote often. And so when it gets to New York, Which is by far the most populous state at this time in America. , he gets zero delegates, peace, hugely popular, and he completely loses. , he gets nothing from New York. And it's because of Tammany hall and there she cannery. Sorry. And so this is a huge blow. So it's not good, but he's still got a shop.

And the key for him to pick up William Randolph Hearst: momentum again. Is William Jennings, Bryan. Who he had been William Jennings. Bryan's. Means the border. The only one who really stood by him when no one else would in the last election cycle. And so William Jennings, Bryan is going to give this big speech. It's, you know, all the newspapers are going to be there. Everyone's going to cover it. And Hearst thinks that they have an agreement that he's going to endorse him. So he sends all these supporters to go cheer for them at the speech. And he gives a speech. And it's going and it's going, and he's not mentioning Hearst and he's not mentioning Hearst. And then it ends and he never endorses William Randolph Hearst. And so what becomes clear is that he's thinking. Okay. Well, since people can't really consolidate behind Hearst, maybe there will be a deadlocked convention and I will emerge as the compromised candidate. He's still thinking he's got a chance to be president. And so the fact that he gives this big speech and he doesn't endorse William Randolph Hearst, it sinks his chances. It's basically over after that. So William Jennings, Bryan. Trader. Absolute trader. And so with this Hearst has no shot. He ends up losing the nomination to an old school. Vanilla Democrat by the name of Alton judge Alton. And so judge AlTiN faces off against Teddy Roosevelt in the general election. And it's one of the biggest blowouts in American presidential history. Teddy wins by 20 percentage points. And everyone afterwards kind of realizes man. The democratic party is broken. It needs to be fixed. We can't keep running it this way. I think people realize that someone like Hurst with a populous message would have had a better shot against Teddy Roosevelt. Uh, then this vanilla corrupt Democrat judge Alden. So Hearst is shattered that he has failed. In his big dream and has a little bit of a mental breakdown has to go on a month long vacation. But he hasn't still given up on it entirely. He just thinks. All right. Well, I got to regroup and the presidency is still awaiting. When he comes back from his vacation Hurst realizes what he needs to do. The reason that he lost was the machinations.

And so he decides I need to destroy Tammany hall . And so we decided the best way William Randolph Hearst: to do that is to run for mayor where he can cancel all their corrupt contracts. Uh, deprive them of their money and starve them out. So he runs for mayor as a third-party candidate as neither a Republican, nor a Democrat. He creates his own party called the municipal ownership league. The idea being the city is going to own all these services. Water gas. Ice, uh, instead of these trusts. And this is a huge long shot and a big risk. Right. Because just like today. Uh, almost every racist, just Republicans versus Democrats. Third party candidates usually come way in last place. And if he does, it becomes way in last place. It's just going to destroy. Uh, his reputation as a viable national political figure. You can't run for president. If you run for mayor of New York and come in a distant third. So the stakes are high. Uh, but he gets out, he uses his newspapers to get his message out. And of course he's running on his same anti-trust anti-monopoly message. And once again, it's hugely successful. People are going wild for it. He has these big rallies, big parties, thousands of people cheering wildly at the slightest excuse mega fans that are following him from rallied rally. He goes a little lighter on the fireworks this time, as you might imagine. There's a good quote that describes it. Uh, it says Mr. Hurst had a reception, so enthusiastic and it's cheers. So fanatical in its appearance of devotion. So vigorous in its declaration of voting for him. The all the calculations of politicians about New York were upset. In other words. Uh, people figure it. Okay. Hearst. He's not running as a major party candidate. He's going to come in a distant third, but all of a sudden they're seeing the level of support he has and they think. All right. Well, actually, I don't know what's going to happen this election. And in fact he's doing so well that his opponents. Start kind of conspiring together to stop him. So the Republicans basically drop out. They say. it's looking like hers might win. So, , don't vote for the Republican candidate. Republicans vote for the Democrat, better him than Hurst.

He owns all these huge businesses. And he's not advocating for true socialism. He's not one of ours. And so it's really Hurst against the world. All the powers that be are trying to stop him. And listen to how vitriolic and extremely are about it. Uh, one of the main democratic speakers, this Tammany hall politician, uh, gets out and gives a speech and he says, Hearst represents every appeal to passion that we have observed during the last nine years. Every incitement to murder every encouragement to riot. Every disposition to a re class against class, every assault upon property and every insinuation against the virtue. He's an apostle of a riot, an advocate of disorder, a promoter of socialism. His election would be such a pronouncement of anarchy and riot that the very foundations of society would be shattered. And the whole fabric of social order reduced to ruin. So. Again, I, this is like apocalyptic language. The world is going to end. If you elect William Randolph Hearst as mayor. In, despite all these histrionics, it becomes clear. He's going to win. He's in the lead. People love him. They love this message and they're tired of the Republicans and the Democrats. So the day comes election day. He's going to win. And he sends out his election officials. To go monitor the election. That's what campaigns do. So you have your poll workers and they go to the polls where people vote and they monitor it to make sure that, , nothing fishy is going on. And it's not long before these poll workers start coming back, the campaign headquarters, and they've got bruised and bloody faces and bodies. They've got broken arms and legs and fingers. One person comes in with his finger chewed off, uh, and this is Tammany Hall's. Magnum Opus. This is their PAs that Lost their peak achievement. They steal this election. So shamelessly that even their supporters are a little bit embarrassed. , They're bringing people and they're just not even hiding the fact that they're just having people cycle through and vote time and time again.

They steal the election and even newspapers, who days before we're saying the election of Hertz would lead to absolute anarchy or saying, all right, this is, this is kind of embarrassing. The selection was obviously stolen. But, Hurst is such a toxic figure that no one's willing to do anything about it. So. He loses. Uh, but some good does come of it. Uh, what it does is it essentially forced Democrats to moderate their corruption. They realized, okay. If someone like Hearst can run on an anti-corruption message. And gained so much popular support. And we can't just keep doing this. We have to limit the amount of corruption in our city, government. So this spells kind of the beginning of the end for Tammany hall. Definitely not the end, the end, but things start to unwind from there. And it kind of leads to the rise of the modern New York city. Which is, let's be honest, not completely free from corruption, but it's certainly miles ahead from where it was 110 years ago. So having lost, but having sort of been legitimized in his loss. Hertz decides. Okay, I'm going to take one more run at this. And he runs for governor of the state of New York next. And this time he doesn't run on an independent ticket. He runs as a Democrat and basically gets the Democrats to endorse him. Let him run as a Democrat. By saying, look. If you don't make me your nominee. I'm going to run third party again and spoil your chances. And so say, okay. And a Hearst is the democratic candidate for the governor of New York. And basically the same thing. Replays again, Republicans hate him. Democrats hate him, pretend to kind of not hate him, but, but really the despise him. And, uh,, again, same thing he's doing really well. He's coming out ahead.

{"text": "all . They ' re supposed to be a unifying force . Well , Teddy Roosevelt . Who ' s the president . Lowe ' s and hates Hurst so much that he decides to break this rule . It ' s too important to pass up this election . William Randolph Hearst: So he has a representative go out and give a speech for him. He still maintains the fig leaf of not showing up himself, but his representative gives a speech and says, I am speaking on behalf of the president. And he says about Hearst. Quote, he is the most potent single influence for evil that we have in our day. He also says that he considers her. Quote complicit in the assassination of president William McKinley. So, let me explain that a little bit. Hers had been opposed to McKinley who was president of United States and a Republican and his papers had written a lot of articles opposing him, but crucially, while he was president. Uh, governor, uh, governor elect actually in Kentucky was assassinated. And when he was killed. One of her subscribers basically says that bullet should have been for president McKinley. And he says it's too bad. But if assassination is the only way to remove bad politicians, then assassinations, they will be. So, you know, at the very least he's being kind of flippant about this assassination and at the most. Uh, he's kind of encouraging these fascination president McKinley. So later when president McKinley is indeed assassinated by an anarchist. Republicans. I try to blame it on Hurst and his writers and his papers, but especially on William Randolph, Hearst himself. Now. This anarchist who shot McKinley. He barely spoke English. He couldn't have read any hearse newspapers if he wanted to. So the idea that Hurst or his writers inspired him to kill McKinley. Is kind of ridiculous, but still the stink of this assassination kind of sticks to them and Republicans really try and make it stick. Even still, uh, with Teddy Roosevelt coming in off the top rope at the very last second. The race is really tight and Hurst might have one, but once again, Tammany hall, forts him. They refuse to use their party machinery to turn out the vote in New York city. They kind of sit out the election. And so he narrowly loses to his Republican adversary in the race for governor. And with that Hearst decided that he was basically snake bit. And his ambitions as a politician we're basically over after that. And these three races taken together has run for president mayor and governor. Reveal his fatal flaw as a politician. He was amazing self promotion. Uh, using his newspapers, his magazines and his movies. To create a movement. That people really believed in and could get behind. and he was", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/william-randolph-hearst", "title": "William Randolph Hearst", "chunk_index": 36, "publication_date": "2023-03-10", "total_chunks_in_doc": 49}}
{"text": "for president mayor and governor . Reveal his fatal flaw as a politician . He was amazing self promotion . Uh , using his newspapers , his magazines and his movies . To create a movement . That people really believed in and could get behind . and he was William Randolph Hearst: great at getting his message across and making sure that you couldn't avoid it. You had to know what her stood for because his message was. Present everywhere. But what he was not good at was playing nice with others and this refusal to play party politics, to include others and to defer to the democratic party machine. , that's what made him lose? All these different races. And so, uh, there's lessons to be learned there that, you know, using the tools, the media tools that Hurst used. You can create a political movement. But you have to be willing on a certain level to play with the powers that be. And at least pretend to get along with them. So that's something Hearst was not good at. You know, he probably could have won some of these races if he had been willing to go to the party bosses at Tammany hall. And either compromise a little bit or do FDR did, which was just lie and say that he would cut them in and then cut them out. Once he held power. So his strategy could have been a little bit better around that. And, uh, and he loses those races. So in the 19 teens. He goes back to focusing on building his media empire. And still having influence on politics and policy, but doing it behind the scenes. As a funder and as a media guy who gets his message out through his newspapers and other media entities. So speaking of his media empire, he's been losing money basically this entire time after his last run for governor, he decides, okay. I'm going to focus on this. He turns his papers around a little bit. And they start making him some money they're doing really well. He also expands into film with newsreels that run before feature films. He starts a publishing company that published full length books. And through all of this, he's utilizing what we'd call today. Synergy. So his weekday papers would carry a story and then the newsreel would come out the next day and it would be playing in movie theaters before a feature film. And then his Sunday papers would carry an extended illustrated version. A more in-depth version of the story that had been the weekday papers. And then if that did well, uh, he had Hurst international publishers. That might take the story and make it into a complete narrative as a hard cover book. So you got one story and he makes money on it as", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/william-randolph-hearst", "title": "William Randolph Hearst", "chunk_index": 37, "publication_date": "2023-03-10", "total_chunks_in_doc": 49}}
{"text": "been the weekday papers . And then if that did well , uh , he had Hurst international publishers . That might take the story and make it into a complete narrative as a hard cover book . So you got one story and he makes money on it as William Randolph Hearst: a weekday newspaper, a weekend newspaper. As a filmmaker with newsreels and eventually when he gets into radio. Uh, he does it with radio as well. And then as a book, so you get this really smart idea of, instead of trying to venture out into other random businesses. He staying in the same core business, taking the thing he's really good at, which is writing and storytelling and saying, okay, how many ways can we capitalize on this core strength? Now having said all that the business empire is doing well, but it's still not the thing he cares about the most. So if there's something that he believes in. That would be bad for business. He'll say you're do it anyway. And you see this with world war one. Hearse was basically an isolationist, especially when it comes to Europe. And he was very opposed to the U S getting involved in world war one. And at first, this is fine, but as the war drums get louder and louder, people are enthusiastically getting behind the war and they're really bothered by his continued support for non-involvement. And so there are boycotts circulation drops a little, and where he really loses out is with advertisers Who don't want to be associated with what is coming to be considered an anti patriotic and newspaper. The federal government even sends secret agents to investigate if he was a German spy, which he was not, but it tells you something that they're, they're looking into this. So he's losing money while this is happening, but he continues to oppose roll one. And the thing that really saves him is the U S actually getting into the war because once the USA was fully committed, he basically has to throw up his hands and say, okay. I opposed it, but we're in the war now. And I support us winning, which relieves a lot of pressure people say, okay. And so people start coming around. Circulation improves revenue returns. And the 1920s are really prosperous for Hearst. The American economy is booming and this would be the first time in his life where he's really earning. Lots of money and I mean, lots of money. You know, previously he had just been taking from the family fund or borrowing, but now he's actually generating a lot of revenue.

You also expands into film production starts a studio called cosmopolitan studios . And he partners with MGM and ends up becoming one of the William Randolph Hearst: great Hollywood film producers. So, as I said, he's making money, but he's also, you know, all this stuff costs money. You don't just start up a film production company with no costs. And so in the past he had been asking his parents to fund his endeavors. And he'd been borrowing copiously from banks in order to fund this expansion of his empire. . And he can afford to do that because people will give him money. As long as the business empire seems like it's doing well. So this goes all the way until the great depression. And when it first hits in 1929. Hurst actually does. All right. The stock market is tanking, but he doesn't hold a lot of stocks. He's mostly invested in real estate. And in his media businesses. And so for the first few years of the great depression he's doing okay. But as time goes on, as the years pass. It starts trickling down because businesses don't have the money to advertise in newspapers anymore. And so by the mid 1930s, the revenue of his newspapers is down by more than 40%. And that creates a problem. Because Hearst was up to his eyeballs in debt. He's one of the most prolific borrowers of all time. Part of that, as I said, Was expanding into new businesses, starting film studios, starting new newspapers and magazines. But part of it also comes from his personal addiction to collecting art. And building magnificent buildings. So let's dive into that a little bit. Let's, let's talk about it. Cause I actually think this is a big part of his legacy. So the Hearst estates, he had a castle in Bavaria. A castle in Wales. A huge estate in the mountains in Northern California. Uh, 90 bedroom house in Santa Monica, a huge home in Beverly Hills, a big ranch in Mexico, numerous apartments, houses and properties in New York city. And his Magnum Opus his estate on the central California coast. Now known as Hearst castle. So his family had this ranch land in central California, and it's in the middle of nowhere. It's next to a little town called San Simeon. It's basically exactly halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles. Today, it's still kind of in the middle of nowhere.

Uh , it takes you today a four hour drive from either LA or from San Francisco . And back William Randolph Hearst: then you can imagine they didn't have great highways and cars that went 65 miles an hour. So it took even more than four hours to get from one of the major California cities to his estate. And at first it's just ranch land and he loves going there to camp because it's really beautiful. It's got these Hills that are almost mountains. It's got the beach, it's got sand dunes. It's got grasslands. It's kind of got everything in one. So there's this part of the property that's perched up on a hill. It's really beautiful. You can look down and see the coast from there and he loves to go camping there and decides I'm going to build my dream house in this exact spot. And so he builds this castle. It's called Hearst castle. Although if you look at it, it doesn't really look like a castle. It looks more like a cathedral. And if you go to California, you have to go. I know, I said it's in the middle of nowhere and it is kind of a drive from either LA or San Francisco. But it's worth going to, I mean, he builds one of the most beautiful estates in the world. I think it's breathtaking. I've been, I love it. As I said, the central building looks like a giant cathedral. It's kind of in a Spanish Mediterranean style. And it's surrounded by these beautiful guest lodgings. That would be amazing mansions in their own. Right. And there's three of them sitting around it. And so it's beautiful. It has dozens and dozens of bedrooms. But as I said, it's in the middle of nowhere, so he needs to make it an attractive place for others to come visit him. So he builds. All these attractions, he builds. What I think is the most beautiful outdoor swimming pool in the world. And then he also builds what I think is the most beautiful indoor swimming pool in the world. He has the world's largest private zoo complete with bears lions, giraffes monkeys, a cheetah, a leopard Bobcat's cougars, bison, antelope, reindeer, llamas, kangaroos, a Wallaby, a tape here, sheep goats, and.

He ' s got a 50 person , movie theater loaded with the latest movies . He ' s got tennis courts . William Randolph Hearst: He's got croquet, he's got it all. And one of my favorite stories is that he would have tennis tournaments and at the end. Uh, Butler would bring down a silver platter full of expensive jewelry. And watches and nice things for everyone to have as a party favor. And the winner of the tennis tournament got first pick of all this jewelry. And so this cool environment where, you know, you can go horseback riding, you can go to the zoo, you can play tennis, you can go swimming. This works. And throughout the twenties and thirties, He's getting a bunch of people to come visit him. In the kind of early to mid twenties, it's more of a newspaper guy hangout, right? His business associates will come up. 10 or 20 at a time on the weekend and visit him. And then, uh, starting in the late twenties and through the thirties, it becomes more of a Hollywood hangout. And that's because, you know, a he's becoming a Hollywood executive, he started his studio. Um, but it's more than that. So, He was married to Millicent Wilson, but he starts an affair with this woman named Marion Davies. And she was another chorus girl, an 18 year old chorus girl that he had a type. You have to give him that. And over time and he's basically unwilling to leave his family. So he never divorces Millicent, but Marian becomes his defacto wife. She's the one that he spends all of his time with. And he makes her into a movie star. He, uh, he turns her into a big Hollywood actress and has her star in all of the movies that he produces. And, you know, he, he does, as this happens, this transition to Marion Davies, essentially becoming his wife happens. He does maintain a relationship with Millicent, their friends. It's not that she was unhurt. She talks about the loneliness, the hurt, the embarrassment. I mean. You know, She doesn't like him having this very public affair with this other woman. But they come to an understanding. Uh, they raised their kids together. They will see each other over Christmas and official functions and things like that.

Hearst castle is William Randolph Hearst: the place to go for the who's. Who? Of Hollywood. So Charlie Chaplin, Clark Gable, Cary grant, all the big actors, actresses and directors are coming up on the weekends to go to her castle. Castle. And it's not just Hollywood. He was also visited there by Winston Churchill, Calvin Coolidge, charles Lindbergh and other public, famous dignitaries and politicians. So it was a truly amazing, amazing place, but as you might imagine, it costs a fortune to build and maintain, and he's constantly building, you know, heal. Have a fireplace built and say, actually I think it should be on the other wall. So they. Completely demolished the fireplace, put in a new fireplace on the other wall, move the chimney. He comes in a month later and says, I think I was wrong. Can you move the fireplace back to the original wall? And he just loved to always be working on always improving and, and, uh, and working on these estates. And in addition to all this building, he's gotten an addiction for collecting. He would look through catalogs and buy European art every single day. Every day, he set aside time to look through these catalogs. And it's not so much paintings, although he did have some very famous paintings. Mostly, honestly, he has Napoleon looking at the Sphinx. . Which is one of my favorite paintings ever. But he's not big into collecting paintings. He's mostly into decorative art and antiquities. So think candlesticks tables, chairs, window frames, moldings wood paneling, statues, vases tiles. Uh, sometimes he would even be touring Europe. And he'd be in a cathedral or a monastery or a castle, and he'd look at a room and go, I love this room. I want the entire room. And so they would take down the entire thing. Strip out all the window frames, all the furniture, all the art. And, uh, and he would buy all of it and they would ship it over and he would basically reassemble it as a new room on one of his estates. So this is a complete addiction. There's some stuff that he would buy. That would be shipped to him and he'd just sit in a warehouse and he would never even see it. And by the end, his collection was worth millions of dollars. In 1920s dollars today, it would have been worth hundreds of millions of dollars.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/william-randolph-hearst", "title": "William Randolph Hearst", "chunk_index": 42, "publication_date": "2023-03-10", "total_chunks_in_doc": 49}}

In 1920s dollars today , it would have been worth hundreds of millions of dollars . William Randolph Hearst: Even approaching probably a billion dollar collection. Of art and antiquities. It was by far. the greatest art collection of the time. You know, there were others who were, close-ish like Rockefeller, but, um, Hurst certainly had the most extensive art collection at the time, his closest competitors would have been places like the lube or the Smithsonian. So, okay. As you can imagine. Assembling a billion dollar art collection, building all these estates as well as buying more newspapers, starting a movie studio, all this. He's just borrowing a ton of money to finance all this. And so in 1937, it's the middle of the great depression. His business incomes are way down. And, uh, he just can't borrow anymore. I mentioned. Revenues are down because of the depression. There's also another reason that he is losing money and that's because he had launched another one of his unprofitable political crusades. And this time it was anti-communism. He had launched the first red scare. In the, in the 1930s. So he sending journalists undercover to catch and publicly out communist. Academics and government officials. And this makes for good headlines. It creates a lot of stir. It does get some readership, but it also alienates a lot of his traditional base. Which was working class pro union pro-labor Democrats. And it especially alienates his considerable Jewish readership. Because those communists in academia and government. We're disproportionately Jewish. And add to that, the fact that he had his columnists, Benito, Mussolini, and Adolf Hitler. And you can see why. You know, the guy who was outing. Communists who has Adolf Hitler as a writer. Uh, might not be popular with the Jewish community. And Hurst was not himself, a Nazi or a fascist. But he liked to have notable people in his columns. And Hiller was the most notable man. Of his age. He was the biggest celebrity. So the fact that he was writing for Hearst newspapers, Was kind of a big deal also. Uh, you know, I don't want to give her totally pass. He thought that. Fascism had done some good things in Italy and Germany, not appropriate for America, but look, it turned around those countries a little bit. Right. And he also, you know, he met with Hitler. And he thought that he could have an impact on him. He thought that the anti-Semitic stuff that he had said", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/william-randolph-hearst", "title": "William Randolph Hearst", "chunk_index": 43, "publication_date": "2023-03-10", "total_chunks_in_doc": 49}}

He thought that the anti - Semitic stuff that he had said William Randolph Hearst: when he was first coming up. You know, you said that was just to get some attention. I would know all about that. I'm sure that's behind him. . And he worked in Hollywood and newspapers. So he was friendly with. A number of Jewish people. And they kind of asked him to liaison for them. They said, could you talk to Hitler when you talk to him? Uh, about, this whole antisemitic main, could you get him to calm down a little bit? And so he does, he brings it up. And Hitler doesn't give a very impressive response. But still Hearst thinks that it's not that big of a deal. He really doesn't think he's going to do anything too aggressive against the Jews. Um, and that goes all the way up until Kristallnacht. Uh, crystal knocked is when he finally drops Hitler as a columnist, , But yeah, he, you know, He stuck with him as, as a columnist for quite a long time. And he also, you know, he would have the other side on as well. Leon Trotsky was someone who wrote regularly for his newspapers, uh, Eleanor Roosevelt also. So. He just liked big notable people. But anyways, his flirtation, I guess you could say with fascism combined with his red scare anti-communism, , alienates, a lot of Jewish readers and not just Jewish readers. A lot of his working class, Italian, Irish, and German and Slavic, uh, base. Was very pro-labor and pro union. And, you know, Labor unions was where a lot of communist foment was coming from. So this is creating a lot of conflict with his traditional base, his traditional readership. And so. His circulation is dropping and he doesn't care. He really believes in this anti-communism he resents the fact that communists are trying to infiltrate and subvert American institutions. So he goes ahead. But, you know, it's driving him bankrupt, he's losing lots of money. And so in 1937, he just, he can't borrow anymore. Uh, he has borrowed so much, so his company goes into receivership. And the banks take it over. And they demote him from being CEO. They take half of his art collection and sell it off to pay off his debts. They start selling some of his less successful newspapers.

Uh, in the coming six years, they do eventually manage to make her corporation profitable, but they also greatly reduce the size of his business empire. , . So after six years, he takes it over again in 1943 or 44. , And at that point, world war II. Is happening, which kind of. Papers over the whole red scare anti-communist thing. , a lot of his readers return. And, uh, his business empire He's more successful from that time until the end of his life, he still would maintain day-to-day control. Basically up until the very end. And he slows down a little bit in the last couple months of his life. Um, But up until then he himself would go offer very detailed feedback on articles, headlines, and layout. , but he has heart disease. And, uh, in 1951 at the age of 88, he passes away. After his death, the business actually does considerably better. It was no longer a vehicle for his personal ambitions and opinions to influence American society and policy. But now, you know, within, out of the way, It's just a money-making venture and they have great assets. They got great newspapers, great magazines. And so it grows and grows. And today it's one of the largest private corporations in the world with annual revenues of more than $10 billion. And it owns a lot of things that you've probably heard of cosmopolitan magazine owns 50% of AMD network, 25% of ESPN. And it's a big part of his legacy that still stands. So what can we learn from the life of William Randolph Hearst? I shared a few lessons last time, but let me add a few things here. The first is you've got to really champion a cause if you want to be involved politically. I've seen a number of people. Float. Uh, different celebrities. And say that they should become politicians like the rock and Oprah. And on a couple occasions, at least with the rock, it seems like he maybe considered it. Like, Hey, you know, Donald Trump was a celebrity, it worked for him. Everyone loves me the rock. Uh, everyone loves Oprah, like for sure they would succeed as politicians. If Donald Trump can succeed and he's very divisive and very controversial. Why not? A less controversial figure that everyone loves, like the rock. But the thing", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/william-randolph-hearst", "title": "William Randolph Hearst", "chunk_index": 45, "publication_date": "2023-03-10", "total_chunks_in_doc": 49}}
{"text": "rock . Uh , everyone loves Oprah , like for sure they would succeed as politicians . If Donald Trump can succeed and he ' s very divisive and very controversial . Why not ? A less controversial figure that everyone loves , like the rock . But the thing William Randolph Hearst: that you learned from Hurst is that in order to succeed in that world, You really have to champion a cause you have to be willing to be controversial and not just willing to be controversial, but you got to lean into the controversy. Right? You have to really take over and own one of these big causes when these big movements. It doesn't work to be harmless to be sanitized, to be safe. And so if you're someone who has been successful in media and you're interested in turning that into influence. Politically. Then just know that they're going to have to be willing to be controversial and champion a cause you can't just rise above it all. That's just not how it works. The other lesson is if you're going to do that, it doesn't matter how wealthy you are, how big your platform is, how many people you have access to, you have to be willing to ally yourself with entrenched powers and not try and do it all on yourself. At least on a certain level. So her's tried to avoid and distance himself from the democratic party. And that's what the feeded him every single time. So you'd be willing to make a deal with the devil a little bit. If you're going to go that route. And just be ready that if you're going to go into politics, yes, you can use your platform to be independent and speak directly to people, but if you try to completely avoid political parties and entrenched powers, It's probably gonna end up for you the same way. Ended up for Hearst. On the business side. Hers was a micromanager when it came to his newspapers and his content, like he really cared about making excellent newspapers, magazines, and movies. He would get his hands dirty with red ink. And if you don't. Love to get into the minutia. If you don't love to micromanage your business, then that might mean that you don't love the business. And you're probably not going to be as successful as someone who does. And then the last thing, my last takeaway that'll point out from the wife of William Randolph Hearst. Is, this is someone who knew how to spend his money. Like he was a great spender. Yes. He spent too much. And that did lead to kind of his, his downfall at the end, at least for a time, but at least he", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/william-randolph-hearst", "title": "William Randolph Hearst", "chunk_index": 46, "publication_date": "2023-03-10", "total_chunks_in_doc": 49}}

And that did lead to kind of his , his downfall at the end , at least for a time , but at least he William Randolph Hearst: did it well. Like what can you tell me about the house of Jeff Bezos or bill gates? Is anyone going to take their house? And turn it into one of the most visited state parks in the U S once they die. Do they have the largest private zoo in the world at their estates? Can their private collection. You know, stand toe to toe. Would that have the loop? Does all Hollywood. Come up to the house of Jeff Bezos on the weekends to party. Um, like, no, I think so many people have lost the ability to spend well to build things that are beautiful and stand the test of time. So if you're listening to this and you're someone with money, I hope it inspires you to live a. More creatively. Interesting. Uh, life. Build something that Lascaux go visit Hearst castle, and then start thinking about your own legacy and what am I going to leave behind? That is going to be, As, as beautiful and long lasting and desirable is this. One last little takeaway. This is the most random one, but it was interesting to me. , there's this quote, let me see if I can find the quote. Uh, here's what it says. This is, this is the chief by David Nassau. And it says often the tallest man in the room with vivid blue eyes and a lifelong habit of staring unblinkingly at his interlocutor. He struck many visitors to San Simeon as cold and distant. Now, um, Take out the cold and distant part. I think it's so interesting. That he did the Steve jobs thing. He stared at people. And you hear this about a lot of successful people. Uh, people sometimes refer to it as the tractor beam with bill Clinton. Uh, so he did the same thing. He would just stare at you.

According to them, Elizabeth II was the leader of a brutal empire that exploited and murdered across the entire world on every continent. And then there were those on the far right who also didn't have good things to say about her. But this time, because she had overseen the dismantling of the British Empire, she had brought to an end this glorious thing that had, you know, the son never set on the British Empire until Elizabeth II came along, right? . So, I'm very intrigued by this contradiction, which was she, Is she a symbol of colonization or decolonization? And in either case, did she have anything to do with it?

She was born on the 21st of April, 1926, and at the time, her grandfather, King George the fifth was the. Growing up, she called him Grandpa England, which I just love. Elizabeth was never supposed to be queen because her father was never supposed to be king. He was born second in line to the throne. His older brother, Edward, was first in line, and in fact, when George the fifth died in 1936, Edward did indeed become king. But there were a couple problems with Edward. The first is that he was a notorious philander, a very common pastime for British royalty. He had begun an affair with an American woman named Wallace Simpson. Simpson was twice divorced and was well known as a socialite and partier, and also seen as , a woman of ill repute, shall we say? This is a family friendly show, but I think, you know what I mean. Uh, she wasn't exactly a professional, but um, she wasn't an amateur either. So when Edward made clear his intention to marry this woman, Wallace Simpson, the British Public Press and the Royal establishment had a collective. Edward was a philander. Okay. , that's not very unexpected honestly, for British royalty. It wasn't viewed as a positive thing, but it certainly viewed as forgivable as an adolescent phase that up and coming princes are allowed to work through. And there is sort of a royal script for how a young prince grows out of this adolescent phase. He marries the innocent young version, signifying that he has left this all behind. And Wallace Simpson was not", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/elizabeth-ii", "title": "Elizabeth II", "chunk_index": 1, "publication_date": "2022-10-04", "total_chunks_in_doc": 17}}

He marries the innocent young version , signifying that he has left this all behind . And Wallace Simpson was not Elizabeth II: exactly an innocent young version. She was also not British, let alone of royal stock. So this is not someone that anyone could see being the Queen of Great Britain. The official narrative is that this is why King Edward the eighth advocated the throne. He basically stepped down as king in order to be with this woman. And I do think that was a big part of it, but I do think there is another reason, edward had very right wing views. He was at least sympathetic to fascism, and it's probably not wrong to describe him as an outright fascist, and he wasn't just passively fascist. He made an early indication in his reign that he intended to be an active and potentially politically involved king. Now, let me just say that this is 1936, right? And fascism was not the fringe view that it is today. In the 1930s, many normal Brits and Americans and people from all over the. Would describe themselves as fascist. It wasn't exactly a mainstream view, but it didn't make you a pariah in polite society the way it does today. Nevertheless, like I said, not mainstream and certainly not with the inte genia in England, , and not with the press. And so this is 1936, the year that Hitler reoccupied the Rhineland and host the Summer Olympics in Berlin. It's hugely embarrassing to the British inte Genia, who are mostly, you know, communist sympathetic at the time. Um, some might say they still are to have a fascist king at this moment. In 1936, well, just six months after his ascension to the throne, a man jumped out of a crowd with a loaded pistol and attempted to assassinate Edward. The wood. Be assassin was subdued by bystanders and the plot failed. The wood Be assassin was soon revealed to be an I five informant. M i five is the British Domestic Intelligent Service, basically the British fbi, and it should be noted that the man only served 12 months in jail. For an attempted assassination of the king. Now, of course, at the time, m I five claimed that this was just happenstance that he was supposedly a spy working with the Italians, , and that this man was a double agent and reporting all his findings to m i five, but he had gone rogue all of a sudden and not reported. This assassination request from the Italians. He hadn't reported it to m i five. Well, just two years ago. In 2020, new documents were released that demonstrated that", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/elizabeth-ii", "title": "Elizabeth II", "chunk_index": 2, "publication_date": "2022-10-04", "total_chunks_in_doc": 17}}

In 2020 , new documents were released that demonstrated that Elizabeth II: he had told m I five all about the assassination plot multiple times, and they had done absolutely nothing about it. They had completely ignored the information, even though this was a known informant to them who? Worked with frequently. , this doesn't look good. And historian Alexander Larman said about this new information, , in 2020 quote, it is entirely possible that m i five were aware of the planned attempt and were happy to let him assassinate Edward, thereby removing an internationally embarrassing monarch with believed Nazi sympathies from the throne. And I don't think it's a very far jump from there to say that m i five may have orchestrated the intent themselves. I mean, it doesn't really make sense to me why the Italians would want to assassinate King Edward when at the time Mo Salini was the leader of the Italian government, it, it was a fascist country at the time. So why would they want to kill, uh, the most, not. You know, fascist sympathetic monarch in the world and doesn't make sense to me. But so whatever the, the, the information indicates that the British Security services were at least turning a blind eye and may have actively been orchestra. An attempted assassination of the king. So, look, Edward stated that the reason he abdicated was because of Wallace. Simpson. There really were negotiations to see if he could remain king and marry her. There are good reasons to believe that it was indeed the reason he abdicated as king. But when you have good reason to believe that your own intelligence service might be trying to assassinate you, or at least might be allowing it to happen, that might be a catalyst to want to step down as king. So, , I do think there is that element of as well, but for whatever reason, uh, with Edward Abdicating, his younger brother Albert, who was Elizabeth's father, comes to the throne. This happens when she is 10 years old. . Now, Elizabeth's childhood had in many ways been idyllic. She hadn't grown up in a palace. She did grow up in a mansion. She was still royalty, but not in an actual palace. , she loved the outdoors and she was able to spend considerable time outdoors.

And surrounded by accomplished tutors. And she was educated well. Though her mother, who was sort of an old school Scottish aristocrat, tended to emphasize history, literature, and music, and tried to dissuade education in what she considered to be the more masculine subjects like math and science. And throughout her life, occasionally Elizabeth would demonstrate, , sometimes surprising ignorance of, uh, some of these more hard science subject. She was a precocious girl and well liked. She was always her grandfather's favorite, and even Winston Churchill was very impressed by the young girl when he met her, when she was very young. So she's living this idyllic, carefree childhood outta the public eye, having a great time outdoors, loving nature. But her carefree existence comes to an end when her uncle steps down with only a younger sister and no brothers. She was now the presumptive heir to the. There's a famous exchange where she's talking to her sister Margaret, and Margaret says, You're gonna be the queen now. And Elizabeth says, one day. And Margaret says, Poor you. And I don't think this was sour grapes. I think they viewed the queenship as a genuine burden. Elizabeth's first public duty came in 1940 when she was 14 years old. This was during the Blitz when Germany was bombing London. She gave this radio broadcast the comfort Children across England. And you can listen to a snippet here to hear what she sounded like as a 14 year old trying to comfort other children throughout Great Britain In 1945, as the war had progressed and was coming closer to drawing to a close, she joined the military as a. And this was definitely a publicity stunt, but it was also an important display that the Royal family was in it together with the British public. Later in 1945, on May 8th, the Allied Powers celebrated Victory Day. Nazi Germany had officially been defeated, and the people of England flock to the streets in mass to celebrate. Elizabeth and her sister Margaret were allowed to sneak out and join the celebrations on the streets with their caps pulled low to avoid recognition. She later said, quote, I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down White Hall. All of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief.

It was one of the most memorable moments of her life because it was one of the few moments when Elizabeth II: she could actually. A part of the public, a part of a crowd, that she could feel unknown. And as I studied and, and read more about the life of Elizabeth, I've kind of been struck by this sense of isolation. Like she was a caged animal and obviously she was in one of the most beautiful cages you can imagine, but caged nonetheless. And I think her recollection of ve day demonstrates that. And it was so memorable to her because, It was the only day that she would have like that in her life, which is pretty remarkable to me. I don't think Elizabeth was naive to what she was sacrificing when she signed up to be Queen, but she believed strongly in duty and she thought this sort of royal isolation was a part of the job. And so, you know, she, uh, in a classic English fashion, stiff up her lip. She wore it. She, uh, and she, she wore it. Well. She, she never complained about it. But it's something that you can kinda see throughout her life. Around this time, she begins getting serious with a foreign royal and distant cousin named. They had met when she was 13 and like I said, he was foreign and so, uh, he was out of the country, but they wrote many letters to one another over the years. And now the romance began in earnest. Well, the firm was not happy about this. Romance, uh, was not happy about Philip and the firm is the professional bureaucracy around the royal. It's sometimes also called the royal institution or the institution. They were not happy with this relationship because it was a lopsided match in many ways in terms of money, titles and prestige. Phillip was a foreigner with no property, limited financial means, and to boot, he was German, which was not the best thing you could be in the wake of World War ii, but Elizabeth was young and in love and didn't particularly care about the opinions of the firm. So in July of 1947, when Princess Elizabeth was 21 years old, the two are engaged. They are married in November of that year. The wedding was beautiful and elegant, but humble. Maybe a little more subdued than usual by the standards of British royalty because post-War Britain was still suffering the consequences of the.

It really managed to kind of split the middle. Uh, it avoided a lot of criticism and not only avoided criticism, but was a really a popular success. Provided some much needed escapism for the British public in what was an extremely difficult economic environment. And it managed to provide them that without seem. out of touch or too opulent. A little under a year after their marriage, Elizabeth gave birth to their first child, Charles, and two years later she gave birth to their second child, Anne. But soon after this, some marital problems began with Philip. He tried to involve himself more in royal business. You know, his primary role is at this time, the queen's cons. In other words, he was a stay-at-home husband. And that was a little emasculating, especially in the 1950s. So he wanted to be treated more as a contributor, perhaps an advisor to the Queen, to sit in her meetings and counsels to offer his advice and to take on some more royal duties. But this attempt was rebuffed by Queen Elizabeth, who felt that the burden of the crown was hers alone. And this caused tension early in their marriage though. How much tension is a matter of debate? Philip always said that it wasn't that big of a deal. Others said that it was. Philip did get some reprieve when he was assigned to active duty with the Royal Navy. At least he could do some good by being a model public service. And in addition, in the Navy, he sort of outside the realm of the royals. He's not being constantly reminded of his subordinate relationship to his. So he's stationed in Malta and then sails around from there. He's got few responsibilities and a lot of free time. So what does he do well, that favorite pastime of British royals since time in Memorial. He gets around to checking in with the local women, seeing what they're doing. Eventually Phillips Philandering becomes public knowledge. Elizabeth and the kids visit him for months at a time, and Malta to kind of, you know, try and keep a lid on this. But ultimately he's brought home to save the royal family, and Elizabeth in particular from further embarrass.

There were a few stated reasons for going to Africa , including recreation site , seeing , uh , Safari , Elizabeth II: but also because there had been some unrest in Kenya. So it was kind of a. Vacation slash political visit, but only six days after arriving, they received news that Elizabeth's father, King George had passed away. It's actually Prince Philip who found out first from a local newspaper, and he breaks the news to Elizabeth. She was stoic, but obviously saddened. No one saw her shed a tear which was kind of her mo. Again, she kinda represented that very British stiff upper. They cut the trip short and she comes back to England as soon as possible where she immediately starts acting in the capacity of Queen. Now, there's a reason that I brought up her uncle's attempted assassination and subsequent resignation, and that's the show, the extent to which British Monarchs had been removed from power. In fact, I would say they were sort of hermetically sealed off from power. There were strong safeguards in place to make sure that they didn't exercise anything like actual power or sovereignty. And that is still true. And so that would kind of be a theme of Elizabeth's reign. I think the fact that she didn't truly rule in any real sense of that word, the decline. The British monarchy basically began with Charles, I first and the English Civil War back in 1640. It then took another big hit with something called the Glorious Revolution, and finally it was really Elizabeth's father or grandfather who was the first purely symbolic king of England, depending on who you ask. But that was really when the transition was happening from what you might call a Mostly ceremonial, mostly symbolic king to an entirely ceremonial or symbolic king. So that is to say whatever impact Elizabeth wanted to make, she would have to do it largely through symbols, pageantry, and tradition, the tools that were available to her. So her coordination was an extremely important event the first thing she had to do was decide her name. Monarchs typically choose a name to rule under when they ascend to the throne. So for example, her father was named Albert, but ruled as King George the sixth. In part, I think he did this to stress the continuity with his father, King George, the fifth, especially after the tumultuous and short reign of his brother. So the option was there for her to take a new name, but Elizabeth decides to take her own name and this could be seen as grandiose since the first Queen.

Elizabeth was one of the most powerful and important British Elizabeth II: monarchs ever, but I don't think it came across that way, and I don't think she intended it that way. When her secretary asked what name she'd rule under, she replied, quote my own. Of course. What else? And. I think that's how she meant it. I think what actually communicated was a lack of pretension, a sort of groundedness that I'm gonna rule under my own name. Elizabeth is my name, and I'm still Elizabeth, I'm still Jenny from the block. She also needed to decide on her last name. She belonged to House Windsor and her husband belonged to House Mount Batten. Now there was some precedent for a queen taking her husband's name, her great, great grandmother. Queen Victoria married a German Prince Albert, who was of house Sax, Coberg and Gotha. And their children were of house sax Coberg, Gotha, which changed to Windsor in World War I because it sounded too German while they were fighting war with Germany. So the question was, would her children. Stay House, Windsor, uh, or would she be like Queen Victoria and become house Mount Baton? And she decided that they would stay House Windsor. Phillip considered this another slight, and he complained. Quote, I'm the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children, but Elizabeth is someone for whom history was always very, I. House Windsor sounded British in people's minds. It was the Royal House of Great Britain. It carried a lot of positive connotations because of Elizabeth's father and grandfather, and she wasn't willing to throw that all away. So she decided to upset her husband instead of the British public, and, uh, and go forward with her name. Elizabeth's coronation ceremony was a huge deal. Hundreds of thousands of people lined the route to Westminster a and more than 20 million people watched the ceremony on television, the actual coordination ceremony itself was not televised as it was considered a religious ceremony, and therefore, two sacred to be shown on television. But everything else around the procession and all the pomp and circum. Was shown. And what's remarkable to me is how grounded the ceremony was in tradition.

Tone it, tone it down just a tiny bit. Um, but she rode in a gilded coach, which was more than 200 years old. She carried all the regalia of the monarch, including the crown, the cep, and the orb. She used the stone of stone, which was the stone that was taken from Scotland and like a, a sign of, you know, England's superiority over and subjection of Scotland. And I think, you know, obviously she was not the type of person to try and lured her power over others, but for her, I think it was just very important to be rooted in traditions. So she wanted to carry out all the traditional ceremony of becoming a monarch of the United Kingdom. And so on the 2nd of June, 1952, she was asked, Do you solemnly promise and swear to govern the people of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland? And she replied, I solemnly promise so to do. And with that, at the age of only 27, Elizabeth became Elizabeth the Second. By the grace of God of Great Britain, Ireland, and the British dominions beyond the seas Queen defender of the faith, the first thing she does is go on a tour of the Commonwealth, and this is her chance to establish what her vision would be for the United Kingdom and for the monarchy. Now, at this time, decolonization was in full swing. The UK was broke following World War II and reliant on the United States, which was vehemently opposed to colonialism, and I think the British public was also tired of colonialism, or at least certainly not willing to fight for its continued existence in the face of American opposition. So Elizabeth goes out and makes the case for a new kind of commonwealth, one that was to quote her an entirely new conception, built on the highest qualities of the spirit of. Friendship, loyalty and the desire for freedom and peace. In other words, it was to be almost a fraternity of nations. Now, as I pointed out, this was already the direction things were headed. She could have come out as a committed imperialist and tried to lead some sort of public outcry to maintain their few remaining imperial possessions, or maybe even, I guess, clawback, those that had been lost. But it's difficult to imagine that that would've done anything to stop the inevitable.

You know, she'd come out and uh, and said, you know, we're vehemently opposed to decolonization and. , , the United Kingdom, Great Britain, , Decolonize anyway, but sort of discredits their, their power and prestige. So I think she's doing a smart thing by going around and essentially cheering as Britain's overseas territories, solely spin out of British orbit and into new independent nations. This is especially true in Africa, where she had very friendly relations with black natives at a time when the minority white governments were still trying to maintain. And so her going around and kind of hobnobbing was some of these black leaders of his countries, was seen by many white Africans as a betrayal, but was popular on TV back in Britain and with newspapers, and of course with most black Africans in the British territories. Of course, the queen still attended to matters of state during this time, she met with other heads of state. She met with every US president from Truman until Biden, which is pretty remarkable to think about. Uh, except for Linda B. Johnson, I believe. She didn't meet with him, but she met with all the other presidents. She answered letters, cut ribbons, spoke at charities, fundraisers, grand openings, and, and all that sort of thing. Her reputation in performing all of these function. Was that she worked very hard and very quickly she was known as a very fast reader and dictator, meaning dictating, letters. And it was no small task for her secretaries and assistants to be able to keep up with her. So she was a, a very bright woman, , and, , a very effective worker. I think, you know, she would've been a competent leader whether she had been born queen or not. Over the years, Queen Elizabeth II had two more children, and family becomes a very important theme of her reign in some ways. She replaced the idea of a singular important monarch with the idea of the royal family, an ideal loving family that was supposed to showcase the best elements of British culture and British values. I think of it almost as. A living, walking museum to Britishness. The Englishness really the Queen's husband Phillip, was instrumental in this process.

You can see Elizabeth herself sort of outlining this approach in 1957 during the Queen's address, when she sets the stage for this new kind of mon. The pinnacle of this rosy picture of the royal family occurred in 1981 when her son Charles, married Princess Diana. Diana was an icon, very beloved, and their wedding was a beautiful opulent affair highlighting familial and national unit. While projecting beauty and grandeur, the public was enthralled by the wedding and further enthralled. When in the 1980s, Diana gave birth to Princess William and Harry. So the 1980s were generally speaking, a decade of success and public adoration for the royal family, but unfortunately, it was not to last. 1992 was described by Elizabeth as an Anis Harus, a disastrous year. Princess Diana's marriage with Prince Charles broke up in that year, and she published a tell all memoir that revealed an unflattering picture of the royal family. Both Diana and Charles had affairs exposed very publicly. Her other son, Prince Andrew also previously announced his intention to separate from his wife and Elizabeth's daughter, Princess Anne, separated from her husband. So I mean, what are the chances of that in a single year? Three of your four children separate from their spouse? And then to add to it, there's a fire at Queen Elizabeth's favorite Castle Windsor cast. So, yeah, 1992, what a year. I remember when I got broken up with and fired within 24 hours and I thought my life was bad. That doesn't even compare to 1992 for Queen Elizabeth. Now. All these divorces amongst her children weren't finalized until 1996, and it was a minor scandal when she, The queen approved these divorces since, you know, she's the head of the Church of England and the Church of England was officially opposed to divorces in these circumstances. But it wasn't that big of a deal. It wasn't that big of a scandal when she did it. What was a big scandal was in 1997, , when Princess Diana died, in a, in a car crash. , the Queen's reaction to Diana's death became a. It was very controversial because at first she seemed not to react. She didn't fly the flags to have staff.

She doesn ' t issue a statement , Elizabeth II: doesn't leave her summer home at Bellor, doesn't really do anything. And the public is outraged over this. Diana, despite her many issues, and she did have some issues, uh, but she was very beloved. She was fashionable, she was good looking. Uh, she was relatable. And so it felt like a s. The Queen wouldn't even really acknowledge her death, wouldn't show any emotion, wouldn't show that she was affected by it at all. And I think it probably was a snub. One of the primary motivators in Elizabeth's life was duty. And to her it had seemed like Diana shirked her duty. , and I don't know that that's totally fair, but I also don't know that it's Elizabeth's fault. I think that's really just a generational gap in terms of how they approached the burdens and mental health issues that came with royal responsibilities and being a part of the royal family. But so in Elizabeth's mind, Diana had abandoned her royal responsibilities and given up on her marriage. So I think it's safe to say that at this point in their life, and you know, she's, she has left. Elizabeth's son. Of course Charles was not blameless in this, to say the least, but I don't know. It's her son, right? So, um, so anyway, Queen Elizabeth probably meant it as a little bit of a snub. She probably didn't particularly want, uh, to get involved in all this, but it was going over horribly. The public is kind of outraged. Tony Blair, the prime Minister at the time, actually intervenes. He goes to the Queen and tells her, You need to get back to London and do. So, Queen Elizabeth shows up in London and addresses the nation in a speech. And here's a part of what she had to say about Princess Diana, and this speech is very effective. It wins over the public magnificently. And I do think it was heartfelt, obviously when you're the queen, everything is scripted, everything is a show. But that doesn't mean that it's not also heartfelt. I mean, I actually tend to think that if everything you do is public, that you, you probably get used to acting less. You, you kind of. Have to merge your public and your private self. And so I do", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/elizabeth-ii", "title": "Elizabeth II", "chunk_index": 12, "publication_date": "2022-10-04", "total_chunks_in_doc": 17}}

Have to merge your public and your private self . And so I do Elizabeth II: think she had complicated feelings about the death of Diana and um, either way she navigated it. Well, in the end she kind of stumbled at the front, but she ended up navigating this crisis capably the concern that she showed for her. Grandsons previewed her next act as queen, which would essentially be national grand. A lot of the media focus, uh, over the next decade or two, switched to her grandsons, William and Harry, As people started to look forward to the future of the royal family, their military service and their studies at elite universities were great fodder for the newspapers. From there, the height of Elizabeth's popularity probably came in 2012. That was a big royal celebration of the 60th year of Elizabeth's reign. It was called the Diamond Jubilee. The Olympics also took place in London that year, and there was a great skit where James Bond comes in, escorts to Queen to the Olympics. When he first walks into her office, she leaves him waiting for a minute to demonstrate who's really in charge here. you might be James Bond. You might be the coolest man in the world, but you still report to the queen. It was really symbolic of how the queen herself was beloved and seen as tough and sturdy despite her diminutive stature and advanced age. Well, uh, since 2012, it hasn't been all roses for the royal family. Her son Andrew, was implicated in the sex trafficking ring of Jeffrey ep. Megan Markle, who was her son, Harry's wife, maintained that she was mistreated by the royal family. Her son William, married a commoner, Kate. Although, to be honest, that wasn't much of a controversy outside of the firm. But through all these controversies, Queen Elizabeth in her old age has managed to stay above the fray, a symbol of un flagging duty, stability, loyalty, a symbol really of Great Britain itself. Her husband died in 2020, one of old age at the age of 99, and the queen reportedly said that it left a huge void in her life. I know that I talked about his indiscretions as a young man and his dust ups in the Royal. , but, uh, I don't wanna give the wrong impression because they really did develop a happy marriage and were good companions for one another, uh, Throughout their lives.

{"text": "they really did develop a happy marriage and were good companions for one another , uh , Throughout their lives . I mean , you know , obviously at the beginning those problems were what they were . , but I still think they loved each other throughout that and Elizabeth II: that love only grew. Um, and their partnership grew o over the decades. She of course, followed him to the grave a little more than a year later, also dying of old age. So what are we to make of this woman of Queen Elizabeth ii? What is her legacy? She was someone who was intensely committed to tradition, loyalty and duty. She was clever and tough, a hard worker and a very private person perhaps bordering on. Or emotionally distant. She is sort of an odd character in terms of where she falls in history. Nominally, she was the ruler of one of the most powerful nations on earth, and yet in reality, she was a prisoner of it with no say over its actions or policies. People who complain about. Colonialism or the cost of the royals. I mean, she had nothing to do with that. And the cost is negligible. And even, you know, people on the other side who say they bring in all this tax revenue through tourism, that's also probably negligible in all honesty, all the policy and government stuff is a Wash Britain's royal family. They're not political actors and Queen Elizabeth. I second certainly wasn't one. I think more than anything, Queen Elizabeth II represents a tether to the past. There's a link between the Britain of Old and the Britain of today. You know, if you trace it back far enough, her rule supposedly rests on her dissent from Oden. Right? Uh, that that's where her defined right of kings comes from. And I think that is embarrassing for those who would like to move past Britain's, I guess, sort of parochial past those who are embarrassed of. Um, it's colonial past, or even just its white past. , and would like to conceive of Great Britain purely as a modern multicultural enterprise she is a reminder of Britain as a unique place in the world with a unique history and legacy, , with all that comes with that good and bad. , all the glory, all the warts. And I do think that under a different ruler that tethered to history might have been severed. I think that the strength of her character will resonate through the institution of the British monarchy for a long time because she strengthened that institution a lot through her popularity and through her engagement with the public. So I think that's a big part of her legacy. The other thing is I found this an interesting study of power.

The other thing is I found this an interesting study of power . I came into this Elizabeth II: kind of wondering, you know, is she responsible for colonialism? Is she responsible for decolonization? And I guess along with that went, how much power did she really have and who really holds power In Great Britain. , I just kinda had this curiosity about whether it would be possible for some enterprising young king to actually seize power in some circumstance as a fun thought exercise, as a way of sort of gauging, Okay. Is there a circumstance under which she could have done more? So I was on the lookout and after studying the life of Elizabeth, the second. I think I conclude that the United Kingdom is a nation that is controlled not by a king, not by parliament, but by three or four newspapers, seemingly everything. Elizabeth, the second did in her life was to placate the media To the extent that she was judged successful. It was because she pleased the media in London and to the extent that she failed, it was because she failed to please them. And so in this way, it's, they are like the monarchs who rule the monarch. And I just thought that was interesting. We've got a word for monarchy, a word for democracy, but what do you call rule by newspapers? Someone more clever than me is gonna have to coin a word for that. Uh, but I think that's what England is right now. And lastly, I would just like to say that Queen Elizabeth II was a remarkable woman with uncommon strength of character and commitment to her ideals. She really was tireless. And you know what's interesting to me is when you think about that, where initially she doesn't issue a statement at Princess Diana's death. It's remarkable because it's the one time in her life that she isn't rock solid and totally dependable, and I think that one little slip up highlights the extent to which she didn't have slipups. She really was one of the most consistent. That I've ever studied or, or read about. I think consistency is a huge theme of her rule and reign. So for her steadiness, for her good humor, for her commitment to. Tradition for her kindness, for her general decency. She will long be remembered. She was representative.

This is Ben Wilson. This is part two in my series on J. Robert Oppenheimer. In this episode, I'm going to review the movie Oppenheimer. So I'm going to talk about what was accurate, and what was not accurate, and what I thought was true to character, and what I maybe imagined differently from what was portrayed in the movie and more generally what I liked and what I didn‚Äôt like. I'm also going to go through some of my endnotes. So some of the thoughts, just a couple of things I jotted down that didn't fit into the narrative on the main episode that I think you still might be interested in.

So I've actually watched the Oppenheimer movie twice now, and on the second time I took really detailed notes of what I thought and how it compared to real life. So I'm just going to go through some of those notes. And to start off with, I really liked the movie. Excellent music, good acting, incredible cinematography. I really enjoyed it and if you haven‚Äôt seen it yet I think you will too. So when I go through and note some of these historical inaccuracies, it‚Äôs not necessarily a criticism. I mean sometimes it is, but most of the time I assume Christopher Nolan and his team knew the real history, they just needed to simplify things because it‚Äôs a movie. You know it was already three hours long, and there is a bunch of stuff that I wish they had included, but what was Nolan going to do, make it a four hour movie? Of course", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/oppenheimer-movie-review-and-endnotes", "title": "Oppenheimer (Movie Review and Endnotes)", "chunk_index": 2, "publication_date": "2023-08-22", "total_chunks_in_doc": 18}}
{"text": "to simplify things because it ‚Äô s a movie . You know it was already three hours long , and there is a bunch of stuff that I wish they had included , but what was Nolan going to do , make it a four hour movie ? Of course Oppenheimer (Movie Review and Endnotes): not, so I‚Äôm pointing this stuff out because it‚Äôs interesting to see where they made changes and to note what really happened, but I‚Äôm not doing it as a criticism of the team behind Oppenheimer. so first, the poisoning of the apple. This played out differently in real life. For one thing, Niels Bohr was not involved in any way. For another thing, he did get caught. He actually turned himself in, which does not happen in the movie. And then thirdly, the fact that he did turn himself in, they knew that he tried to poison Blackett, but he didn't get kicked out of the university. He only got sent to see a psychiatrist in London. Probably means that he didn't poison to kill. So they have him putting in I think it's like potassium cyanide. But that stuff that will kill you. It seems maybe like it was a little bit more of a prank like he was hoping to make Blackett sick If you literally tried to kill your professor I I don't think it would let you keep going to college there. And I wish they had made that just a part of his larger descent into madness and talked about some of these other stories of him trying to strangle people and drop luggage on their head and everything else. One thing from early on in the moviethat was correct that I didn't mention in the first episode is Oppenheimer's math was always not good. He always was self conscious about it. He was embarrassed by the fact that he did not have a super deep understanding of the mathematics behind physics. Part of that was the fact that he didn't study physics as an undergraduate. He studied chemistry and I think he just never got around to getting some of those fundamental mathematics. And then by then I think he was so far ahead in the field, that he was embarrassed to go back and learn basic mathematical physics so he never did. Which leads me to another story actually that I liked that I didn't talk about in the first episode and they did not have in the movie, which is as a child he was forced by his mother, who was very cultured, to take piano lessons. And he hated piano lessons. And so there's this story that one time he gets really, really sick and is bedridden for weeks and is in terrible pain. And so his mother comes and checks on him and says, you know, Robert, how do you feel? And he says.

{"text": "s this story that one time he gets really , really sick and is bedridden for weeks and is in terrible pain . And so his mother comes and checks on him and says , you know , Robert , how do you feel ? And he says . Like Oppenheimer (Movie Review and Endnotes): I do when I have to practice the piano. And so that was kind of the final straw. She's like, okay, you don't have to take piano lessons anymore if you hate it that much. One of his colleagues said that Oppenheimer was the only physicist who he ever knew who wasn't musical. And there is this connection between mathematical ability and musicality. People who are good at math are often musical. Whether that is Einstein who was a very good violin player, or Brian May, the lead guitarist for the band Queen, who studied mathematics and physics at the imperial college of London before embarking on a music career. So it‚Äôs interesting that mathematics and music tend to go together and Oppenheimer appeared not to be terribly gifted at either. On the topic of Einstein, who I just mentioned, they were not all that close. They did have more contact after the war when they were both at Princeton, but they didn‚Äôt talk that much, and the movie takes a lot of conversations that Oppenehimer was with other people, and makes them between him and Einstein. Which is understandable, Einstein is a big name, everyone knows who he is. It makes sense that they would expand his role in Oppenheimer‚Äôs life, but it‚Äôs worth noting that basically all of the Einstein scenes are made up, other than the one where he urges him to turn his back on the US when his security clearance is being revoked. One other note when Oppenheimer is talking to Strauss. So Strauss, his name is spelled like Strauss, which is a very Jewish name. He pronounced it Strauss cause he says that's how they pronounce it in the South. It's the Southern pronunciation and Oppenheimer, whose name is Oppenheimer says, unlike you, I can't hide my Jewishness, which I get what he's saying with the last names, right? Oppenheimer, or what are you going to do with Oppenheimer? That is a very Jewish sounding last name. And yeah, Strauss to Strauss. Okay. You can say it's a Southern pronunciation. Probably there is an element there of I'm hiding my ethnic identity, but what's interesting is that that's not really true to their characters at all. Oppenheimer is the one who hid his Jewishness very much. He was never religiously Jewish, and outside of his upbringing at the Ethical Culture School, never made any efforts to deliberately cultivate relationships with other Jews. Never involved himself in the Jewish community. He did help Jews", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/oppenheimer-movie-review-and-endnotes", "title": "Oppenheimer (Movie Review and Endnotes)", "chunk_index": 4, "publication_date": "2023-08-22", "total_chunks_in_doc": 18}}
{"text": "the one who hid his Jewishness very much . He was never religiously Jewish , and outside of his upbringing at the Ethical Culture School , never made any efforts to deliberately cultivate relationships with other Jews . Never involved himself in the Jewish community . He did help Jews Oppenheimer (Movie Review and Endnotes): who were fleeing Europe when it came under Nazi occupation, so I‚Äôm not trying to say that he 100 percent turned his back on it, but his Jewishness was just not a major part of his life. Whereas Strauss is someone who went to synagogue, was involved with his local Jewish congregation, was personally observant, you know, was Jewish. So it's just interesting that they had that line in there when the reality of how they lived their lives was sort of the opposite. On that note, the person who heckled him the most about his lack of religion was Isidor Rabi. Rabi was very Jewish, in an ethnic sense. Never tried to hide from his Jewishness, and in fact was very in touch with it. He was good friends with Oppenheimer, encouraged him to get in touch with his Jewish side. Rabi claimed that Oppenheimer ‚ÄúNever got to be an integrated personality because he was Jewish, but he wished he weren‚Äôt and tried to pretend he wasn‚Äôt.‚Äù Rabi sort of acted as Oppenheimer‚Äôs conscience in many ways and I think he is played very well by David Krumholtz in the film Oppenheimer. He really conveys the warmth that you feel when you read about Isidor Rabi. Which actually brings me to one of my criticisms of the film. Everyone is so dour all the time. The two exceptions are Rabi and Neils Bohr, played by Kenneth Branagh. But everyone else is so dour. It‚Äôs especially incongruous with his love interests. So his longtime girlfriend, Jean Tatlock, arguably the love of his life, was a very spunky person, a partier. She was very mercurial, very up and down. But she wasn‚Äôt somber and dour, which is how I think she comes across in the movie. Similarly his wife Kitty was a partier and they make her this very serious woman in the movie, I just don‚Äôt understand why they did that to those two women. Speaking of dour, I think one thing they do pretty well is portray Oppenheimer‚Äôs arrogance. Early on especially you get this feeling of why Strauss wouldn't have liked Oppenheimer,There is a scene where he's walking around with him and he's offering him this amazing position at Princeton and showing him like, look, you're gonna get this house, you're gonna be on these beautiful grounds, you're right across the street from where you'll work, you'll have complete academic freedom. You get to work with all these amazing people. And Oppenheimer", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/oppenheimer-movie-review-and-endnotes", "title": "Oppenheimer (Movie Review and Endnotes)", "chunk_index": 5, "publication_date": "2023-08-22", "total_chunks_in_doc": 18}}
{"text": "re gonna get this house , you ' re gonna be on these beautiful grounds , you ' re right across the street from where you ' ll work , you ' ll have complete academic freedom . You get to work with all these amazing people . And Oppenheimer Oppenheimer (Movie Review and Endnotes): goes, I'll consider it. He goes, this is an amazing offer I'm making you. And Robert says, yeah. That's why I'm considering it. And it does come across as condescending. And in that moment, I think you get why straws would feel the way he did about Oppenheimer. One of the interesting things, is you have all these people who agreed that Oppenheimer could be just unbelievably condescending and arrogant. Almost reflexively so. And yet somehow, he was able to turn it off during the Manhattan Project. They all agree that that arrogance was put in check when he needed it most, which I find really interesting. One other thing I was shocked they didn‚Äôt include was Oppenheimer and Heisenberg cometing for the same girl in Gottingen. It just feels so cinematic, in grad school we went after the same girl, and now we‚Äôre racing each other to build the atom bomb. But I guess you can only include so many love interests. And so many rivals, right? They would have had to do much more of a Heisenberg storyline. One thing in the movie, they take his word for it - when Oppenheimer said that he was just a fellow traveler and never a communist party member. I went over this in the first episode, but it is likely that he was in fact, a secret communist party member based on the evidence. That's what I think. Of course, no one can know for sure. That's the nature of being a secret party member. You know, he paid communist party dues. And they actually say, in the movie. He says, yes, I donated through the communist party to the Spanish civil war through 1942. Well, the Spanish civil war ended in 1939. So um, that right there kind of is the crux of the issue of why to me, it seems like he was a party member. Like these look more like party dues than they do like contributions to a foreign war effort. Okay, other notes I made‚Ä¶. Speaking of Jean Tatlock, there are two more things I want to point out. There is this scene in the movie where he brings her flowers and she says no more flowers and throws them away in his face. And that really happened. Oppenheimer would bring her flowers and she would always go, Robert, stop bringing me flowers. She hated it. She asked him to stop multiple times but it was compulsive.

{"text": "really happened . Oppenheimer would bring her flowers and she would always go , Robert , stop bringing me flowers . She hated it . She asked him to stop multiple times but it was compulsive . Even after she complained repeatedly , please no more flowers . He would Oppenheimer (Movie Review and Endnotes): bring her flowers. And she would throw them away in front of his face. And you see that in the movie. I thought that was a great scene because that's really what happened in real life. It was just one of those quirks of Oppenheimer‚Äôs personality. He liked to be thoughtful. And so he persisted in getting her flowers even after she asked him not to. One thing the movie insinuates is that maybe Jean Tatlock was murdered. She was not murdered. She committed suicide. There's no good evidence to me that she was killed by the FBI. In the book, American Prometheus, the authors try to make the case that maybe she was murdered, and that is where the movie gets it from. I just think the evidence that they put out there is so, so weak. So the evidence is that she didn‚Äôt sign her suicide note. But it was in her handwriting. She didn‚Äôt sign it because she had just taken lethal amounts of drugs and her handwriting slowly gets worse and trails off. Also there was a sedative in her blood that you can use to knock someone out like a chloroform type thing. So that is the other piece of evidence they pointed to. But it was only trace amounts, it wouldn‚Äôt have been enough to knock her out, and she did a lot of drugs recreationally and that could have been one. I guess the other thing that seems like evidence is it's a very weird way to kill yourself, to drown yourself in a bathtub. Which I agree. I think what happened was she was trying to overdose in the bath. She wanted to die peacefully in a warm bath. And the drugs kicked in too soon and she fell in face first and drowned before she could get in. From suicide onto happier things‚Ä¶ one scene that I absolutely love from the movy is when Alvarez, who is a physicist at Berkeley, reads in the paper that they have split the atom and runs out mid haircut. And that really happened in real life. And in the movie Oppenheimer sees him and follows him really in real life. Oppenheimer was already on campus when Alvarez comes in with half a haircut to deliver the news. And then they immediately go out and replicate the results. But I, that to me is one of the few parts of the movie that is genuinely exciting and that feels kind of like this heist movie. I wish more of the movie was like that.

I know it has to be kidn fo somber because this whole things results in Oppenheimer (Movie Review and Endnotes): hundreds of thousands of innocent Japanese people losing their lives, but nevertheless, the atom bomb is one of the great scientific achievements, one of the great human achievements, of all time. And so I wish they had imparted more of that excitement of discovery and of building something unprecedented. That Alvarez scene to me, is one of the few times they did that, and I wish there was more of it in the movie. He never lets it get buoyant and elevate to the point where you're like, wow, this is amazing. Look what they're doing. That to me is the one time in the movie where. Christopher Nolan lets that happen. And I wish he had done more of that throughout the second act. Um, but I did love that scene. One thing, that I thought was stretched, was Kitty was married to someone else and then Robert whisks her off and gets her pregnant. And then he calls up her husband and he says, Hey, I just got your wife pregnant. So let's all be adults about this. And you guys are going to get divorced and I'm going to marry her. The guy is like, okay, but that is to say Kitty went into this marriage with very open eyes. She knew that Robert was a womanizer. It wasn't just Jean Tatlock that he had an affair with. He had at least one other affair. I imagine he had many other affairs while he was married to Kitty. And I don't think that she was naive to this. Again, in the movie, when it comes out in the trial that he had this affair with Jean while he was married to Kitty, he tells her, it's nothing I hadn't already told you, and she says, yeah, but now the whole world knows. But it's still, I don't know, you get this impression, especially with the way that Kitty is played by Emily Blunt. For whatever reason to me, in her body language, it seems to me, that she's very put out by her husband having had this affair, that like, maybe she knew, but it's very raw for her. I don't think that's true. You know, this is the middle of the, this is the middle of the 20th century with a bunch of communists. They were all running around with each other.

Marital ties were , let ' s say , uh , not as strong as they might be Oppenheimer (Movie Review and Endnotes): in some other communities. And so I just think she went in with eyes wide open to the stuff that Oppenheimer was getting up to and I don't think it bothered her that much. It wouldn‚Äôt shock me if Kitty had affairs of her own. Of course it is true. It would be hard to have your husband's affair displayed in front of the entire world. But I thought they overplayed that part. Let‚Äôs stay with Kitty. She was an interesting person. She was a hard drinker. Some people refer to her as an alcoholic. Now, others insisted that she drank a lot, but she was not an alcoholic. Who knows? She liked to socialize and she liked to drink. The issues that they show with their children are true. They gave away their first child for a couple months when he was only a couple months old. And Kitty and Robert went off to the ranch in New Mexico and just spent some time alone because she really struggled with being a mother. The authors of American Prometheus, Bird and Sherwin, think that this is one of the reasons that she never properly bonded with her first son. And that story about Oppenheimer going to another family and asking them if they would adopt their, their son is true. That actually happened. It wasn't actually the Chevaliers, but whatever, they're combining characters, that's fine. But, you know, Robert was a more doting father. He did like being with his kids, but he was never around, you know, he worked so much because of what he was doing and Kitty just really struggled to be at home and be a mother. That scene where the baby is crying and Robert says ‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt you go to him‚Äù and she says ‚Äúyou go to him. I‚Äôve been going to him all day‚Äù was very true to life. And those issues persisted, the Oppenheimer children had very difficult relationships with their parents. Other notes‚Ä¶ I didn't think Matt Damon was a good General Groves. He just didn't have the abrasiveness. I think Matt Damon is just a little Too nice to be General Groves, I also think they kind of wanted to write it So that Oppenheimer was the prime mover Whereas in reality Groves cowed Oppie and got him to do a lot of things that he didn't want to do He got him to turn on a lot of fellow communists and turn people in, for example.

So in the movie , Oppenheimer is always getting one over Oppenheimer (Movie Review and Endnotes): on Groves. And he seems almost meek and deferential toward Oppenheimer. In reality he liked and worked well with Oppenheimer but was never deferential to ANYBODY. He was incredibly hard charging. Always the alpha in the room. IAnd I just think they were missing that abrasiveness from Matt Damon's performance. Groves is just one of the most interesting characters I've ever read about. You don't see characters like that anymore. I think everyone's got to be nice now. there's a great story about groves. At one point he's negotiating with the treasury department to buy a bunch of silver, a bunch of the United States silver stock, because they needed it, I believe for the enrhciment process. So they need all the silver and, well, here's the quote. It says at one point in the negotiations, writes groves, Nichols said that they would need between five and 10, 000 tons of silver. This led to the icy reply. Colonel in the treasury. We do not speak of tons of silver. Our unit is the Troy ounce. At which point they go, okay, we're going to need 395 million Troy ounces of silver. Uh, it ends up being actually 13, over 13, 000 tons of silver that they need. ANd Groves meticulously tracks it and in the end melts it down and returns every ounce back to the treasury department. And he is always doing heroic feats like this. The Manhattan project was just as much a marvel of organizational complexity and industrial design as it was of hard science and engineering. And Groves was the mover behind a lot of that organizational complexity and getting things done. One of the things that I wish I had talked about last episode, actually, now that I think about it, is the brothel at Los Alamos. Of course there are no people around, no professional prostitutes. But some enterprising young women who were hired to do menial tasks around the town, found that this could be a lucrative trade. And so they started a brothel. And eventually, it came to the attention of the higher ups when some venereal diseases started going around. So they shut down the brothel. But then some of the young men start to complain, so they open the brothel back up but this time with testing and hygiene measures in place. Nature finds a way, as the saying goes.

The most intelligent people in the world and they still couldn ‚Äô t resist . Even 160 Oppenheimer (Movie Review and Endnotes): IQ geniuses have human needs. Other notes‚Ä¶I just knew they were Gonna do this. I knew that they were going to make the security agents evil Right. Just trying to stop science from happening and unreasonably suspicious of everyone and seeing ghosts behind every door and in every corner. They portray Kenneth Nichols, who in reality was the director of the project and much more involved in logistics, he was a remarkable man in his own right, but they make him essentially the head of security and this really vindictive evil guy. They don't acknowledge that he was right. There were four spies at Los Alamos. They talk about Klaus Fuchs, who was the most damaging spy, but he was not the only one. There were three others. And so it's just funny to me that they make this guy out to be this great villain for being so suspicious of everyone when it's like, yeah, arguably he should have been more suspicious because there were spies who were smuggling out secrets to the Soviets. And they were able to build an atom bomb only two years later, The whole cold war could have been avoided if these spies had been rooted out. And yet Nichols is portrayed as this villain for being concerned about it. I think it‚Äôs ridiculous. But I‚Äôm not surprised. Okay I guess I better go back to something positive about the movie. One other scene that I love is when they're talking about the nuclear test. And Oppenheimer says, we're going to be so and so this many yards away. And one of the scientists says, are those safe distances? And he says, they're based on your calculations. And so I love that because it just shows the level to which this was a homemade bomb. There was no safety net. There were no official protocols. There was no guidebook, no best practices. This was basically like a science fair project. The nuclear bomb is a science fair project. And it must have been exhilarating but also terrifying to work on. I mostly loved the actual test of the bomb. I love that they did the sound delay. A minute and a half between when they saw the bomb go off and when they actually heard the blast. I thought that was so well done.

My only issue was , I have mixed feelings about the test Oppenheimer (Movie Review and Endnotes): scene the explosion itself was a little underwhelming to me. It didn't look that big. I think they used all real effects. And my feeling is, man, you guys should have just done a CGI nuke. It didn't look like a nuclear explosion. You could tell they were just trying to cut around the fact that it was a relatively small explosion. Maybe I'm a snob but that was how I felt. One other thing that was accurate that they embellished a little was Oppenheimer did go meet with President Truman. He did say, Uh, we feel like we have blood on our hands and Truman really did not like that. He was upset about it. And they do part of his quote. I wanted to pull other things, uh, that he said, Truman said of Oppenheimer blood on his hands, dammit, he hasn't half as much blood on his hands as I have. You just don't go around bellyaching about it. And then he later told his secretary of state, Dean Acheson, I don't want to see that son of a bitch in this office ever again. And he constantly referred to him as a crybaby scientist. I really liked that scene. Although I didn‚Äôt like that they made Truman out to be some sort of idiot. I thought that was unfair. Speaking of Truman. That brings me to one last discrepancy between the movie and the historical record. Oppenheimer definitely had qualms about dropping the bomb on Japan, or at least reservations. He wasn't sure about it and he paced back and forth afterwards saying those poor people, those poor little people. Um, and it's true that he said to Truman, you know, I feel like we might have blood on our hands. But at the same time, he never disavowed his involvement with the project. In fact, there was a play in the early sixties called ‚ÄúOn The Matter of J Robert Oppenheimer‚Äù and it portrayed him much as the movie Oppenheimer does. As feeling abject horror at what he has done. In fact he wrote an open letter to the play. He said you say I think \"we have done the work of the devil.\" \"This is the very opposite of what I think,\" \"I had never said that I regretted participating in a responsible way in the making of the bomb.\" In the movie, when he gives his speech right after the dropping of the bomb on Japan, they make him hallucinate visions of burning corpses and", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/oppenheimer-movie-review-and-endnotes", "title": "Oppenheimer (Movie Review and Endnotes)", "chunk_index": 12, "publication_date": "2023-08-22", "total_chunks_in_doc": 18}}
{"text": "\" \" I had never said that I regretted participating in a responsible way in the making of the bomb . \" In the movie , when he gives his speech right after the dropping of the bomb on Japan , they make him hallucinate visions of burning corpses and Oppenheimer (Movie Review and Endnotes): he's hearing screams and he‚Äôs just so tortured. In reality, and they portray this, but they don't, you know, give you the context in reality, you know, there is that little gym where he gives the speech and normally he would just come out from the side of the stage and walk onto the stage, but to kind of like rile people up, he ran out through the crowd and he does walk out through the crowd in, uh, in the movie. But you don't get the context that, like, this was something special he was doing as, like, a moment of celebration. You know, he's running through the crowd and people go wild and they're cheering, like, Yeah! Woo! We did it! And, look, I mean, just look at the text of what he said. The world will remember this day. It's too soon to determine what the results of the bombing are, but I'll bet the Japanese didn't like it. I'm so proud of what you have accomplished. I just wish we had done it in time to use against the Germans. Um, that's an excerpt of what he said. That's what they have in the movie. It is an accurate excerpt. They portray him as racked with horrible guilt. And while he was sober about what they had done, he always disavowed the notion that he felt guilt or that he had done something wrong by being involved with the Manhattan Project. Okay, just a couple things I wanted to talk about in closing, a few more end notes. One, was Oppenheimer a spy? My answer, probably not, but maybe. Here's a little bit of the evidence, I'll just give you the high level view. First, I guess I'll give you the evidence for him being a spy. This is why some people think he's a spy. There are scholars, good scholars, who think that Oppenheimer was a Soviet spy. Here's why. Number one. Number one, the head Soviet spy for the San Francisco Bay Area said that he was. And so that is pretty compelling evidence. He wrote back, you know, so when the Berlin wall, so, you know, when the Soviet union collapsed, we were able to go in and get a lot of documents. So, you know, there was a lot of back and forth. We were able to,", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/oppenheimer-movie-review-and-endnotes", "title": "Oppenheimer (Movie Review and Endnotes)", "chunk_index": 13, "publication_date": "2023-08-22", "total_chunks_in_doc": 18}}
{"text": ", so when the Berlin wall , so , you know , when the Soviet union collapsed , we were able to go in and get a lot of documents . So , you know , there was a lot of back and forth . We were able to , Oppenheimer (Movie Review and Endnotes): so, you know, we, we now know it's been declassified that the head spy, yeah, he wrote back to the Soviet union and he was giving an accounting of what he had done. And he said, um, you know, look, I recruited J Robert Oppenheimer. To be a spy for us. That's a pretty big feather in my cap. Okay, I'll respond to that later, but that's one piece of evidence. Another is a document from a high ranking, from a high ranking Soviet spy in... Moscow also listed him as a Soviet agent. So both of those are pretty compelling pieces of evidence. And then the other thing is that there were just so many spies at Los Alamos who were never caught. And so, you know, okay, did he turn a blind eye? Um, so did he turn a blind eye, you know, maybe, uh, but what's the evidence against. Okay. The evidence against is this guy in the Bay area who said that he had recruited Oppenheimer. He was being recalled to the Soviet union. He was being recalled to the Soviet union. Um, there were some accusations against him. It's a long story, but he might've been padding his resume a little bit. Right. So maybe Oppenheimer joins this, you know, secret communist group that we had talked about earlier. And he just kind of inflates that to be like, Oh yeah. He was a spy to make himself look better back in Moscow, but he, but he actually wasn't similarly, you know, that document in Moscow from, I think it's like the common turn. So like high up official probably was based on that same evidence. So if you don't believe one, you probably won't believe the other. And then I guess the biggest evidence against him being a spy is there's this conversation that the FBI recorded where essentially you have one of his friends who is a go between is, is essentially a Soviet spy. And look, I know it's not great. He's his friends with a Soviet spy, but okay. His friend who's a Soviet spy is talking with another, is talking with a member of the physics department. I think he's actually a student at the physics department, but a good physicist at Berkeley and, um, this conversation got wiretapped by the FBI. And in it, uh, I think", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/oppenheimer-movie-review-and-endnotes", "title": "Oppenheimer (Movie Review and Endnotes)", "chunk_index": 14, "publication_date": "2023-08-22", "total_chunks_in_doc": 18}}

I think he ' s actually a student at the physics department , but a good physicist at Berkeley and , um , this conversation got wiretapped by the FBI . And in it , uh , I think Oppenheimer (Movie Review and Endnotes): it's Joe Weinberg. And he's talking with Nelson, uh, I think he's talking to Nelson, I think. But anyways, they're going back and forth and they basically say, uh, what's up with Oppenheimer? Can we get him to give some Intel on this project? And, uh, Nelson's going, no, you know, he's not as solid as he used to be. I think his wife is having a bad influence on him and getting involved with all this military stuff. I just, I don't think that, um, you know, I basically, I think he's a squish now. I don't think he's really as committed to communists as he used to be. And on the one hand you might go, Oh, okay, well maybe this is just something that, you know, they know where a FBI wiretap is. And so they, um, so they're kind of conspicuously going. Oh, Oppenheimer, he used to be on our side, but now he's not definitely not a spy in order to like, give him some breathing room, uh, from the FBI. Right. Except, uh, these two give some very incriminating information. In fact, it. Ended up coming down hard on Joe Weinberg and ended up ruining his physics career. So that's not the kind of stuff that you would say if you were kind of trying to drop counter, if you're trying to drop, you know, disinformation for the FBI. So to me, that conversation that was recorded by the FBI. It is really exculpatory. And I do think it's the case that Oppenheimer had been involved with the American communist party and maybe even had shared, I don't even know if you'd called it intelligence, um, but like high level information, uh, he'd, you know, been open with people about what he was doing. I mean, none of that stuff was classified, right. Um, but I think once he got involved in the Manhattan project in an official capacity, this is someone who liked to feel important. And this is someone who ended up turning in other. Former communists and kind of telling on them.

He wasn't going over people's background checks and stuff. Um, that was the army's job. So I don't know how much of that really should land on his shoulders as responsibility. And then I'm going to end with one last question. I don't know if I should answer this question, but I had a friend who listened to the first episode and he says, he's, he's a single guy. He goes, you know, I'm listening to this and the guy's basically an incel can't get a date and then goes to become a notorious womanizer in Berkeley.

What can turn someone from completely hapless with women to, um, to seemingly an unstoppable force? And I think it's a very, pretty easy answer. I mean, he's very intelligent, and so I think that's obviously attractive, right? He was funny, he knew a lot, I don't know. Intelligence is attractive, I think. The other thing is, um, he was a nobody, and then he was a somebody. I think that, I think that everyone, but especially women, are often attracted to competence. So... I think it's good to look for women in your field of competence, if that makes sense. So look, if you are, I don't know, a gym bro, if you're super big and strong, like try and meet women in a context that's going to emphasize that, where they'll know that about you and you try and meet women who that means something to them, right? Um, if you're really, really smart again. You want to find the women who that means something to, um, you know, go where the geeks are essentially, I guess.

I , I think that ' s the thing that changed is when he ' s at Berkeley now , Oppenheimer (Movie Review and Endnotes): he's a world known physicist and all the women that he's meeting, that he's dating, That's how he meets them. They're either students at Berkeley or they are associates of other professors at Berkeley. So he dates other professors daughters and their friends. He also dates people who he meets through the communist party. And he's like a big star, a great speaker there. So it's just, I guess if I have to extrapolate dating advice from this, it's go to places where you're the man and find people there. And, uh, and that's, I think, going to generate more interest. Okay, great. I'm not going to make a habit of this. I don't know that that was the best dating advice in the world. So it might be the only dating advice I ever give on this podcast. That does it for this week. Don't hold it against me. That does it for this week. I hope you enjoyed these end notes until next time. Thank you for listening to how to take over the world. I guess, I always like to close on a more profound note. So I‚Äôll just end with this: What is the meaning of Oppenheimer? And to me, the meaning of all of this is that human ingenuity is an awesome force. Atomic energy is the ultimate expression of our mastery of the universe around us. And yes that power is terrifying and destructive but it‚Äôs also beautiful and inspiring. I actually think that is something the movie does well. It captures the awe and the terror of what humans can accomplish. So be an Oppenheimer. Accomplish the impossible, even if it means shredding the very fabric of reality. I would rather have one Oppenheimer. One Manhattan Project, than a billion happy little peasants digging in the earth day after day. Dare to be a prometheus. Okay that does it.

And to further dampen everyone‚Äôs sinking spirits, an enormous thunderstorm was now rolling through New Mexico. Rain and lightning each presented risks.It also made living conditions miserable. The Trinity test site was little more than a camp, and Oppenheimer coughed all night as the rain beat down on his tent.To calm himself, he read a passage from from the Hindu book of scripture, the Gita ‚ÄúIn battle, in forest, at the precipice in the mountains // On the dark great sea, in the midst of javelins and arrows // In sleep, in confusion, in the depths of shame // The good deeds a man has done before defend himThe next morning, the skies cleared, but the wind picked up. ‚ÄúThe weather is whimsical,‚Äù Oppenheimer", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/oppenheimer", "title": "Oppenheimer", "chunk_index": 0, "publication_date": "2023-08-15", "total_chunks_in_doc": 26}}

And one last moment alone with his grand creation.It was an awkward looking thing, studded with wires and plugs. It was the result of countless hours of work from the greatest minds in the world. An unparalleled creation. Perhaps nothing in the history of the world had had more genius poured into it than the device now before his eyes.When he drove back to base, someone suggested a postponement. The weather was still finicky.‚ÄúIf we postpone,‚Äù Oppenheimer said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never get my people up to pitch again.‚ÄùOkay then, the meteorologist suggested that if they couldn‚Äôt wait, the very early morning of the next day would provide the right weather conditions. Oppenheimer, who knew the New Mexico desert like the back of his hand, agreed.No one slept that night. They all stayed up preparing.Finally, at 5:10 in the morning, a voice crackled across a loudspeaker in the control center ‚ÄúZero minus twenty minutes‚ÄùPhysicists, engineers, and soldiers waited nervously.No one knew what to expect. No one knew if the thing would even work, and if it did go off, how big the explosion would be.As the countdown went to two minutes, Oppenheimer commented ‚ÄúLord, these affairs are hard on the heart.‚ÄùFive, four, three, two, one, The voice rang out over the loud speaker one final time, NOW.Robert Oppenheimer was facedown in the dirt when the blast went off, but the light was so bright that it reflected off the sand and through his eyelids.When he looked up, he saw a fireball, and then a cloud, hovering upward until it reached nearly 30,000 feet, the height of mount everest.Over 10,000 yards away, the sound of the blast would take time to reach them. For nearly a minute and a half, the men watched the mushroom cloud, and the dawn of the atomic age, in silence.IntroductionHELLO, and welcome to How to Take Over the World. This is Ben Wilson.Today we are talking about J Robert Oppenheimer, the American physicist who is popularly known as the father of the atomic bomb.And why study Oppenheimer?

First of all , I think there is a lot Oppenheimer: to learn from him because he was a great leader in the field of science. I think when we think of leadership, we often think of military leaders, or founder, entrepreneurs, business leaders, social leaders, or even sports coaches before we think of science. But leadership is something that is important to every field, so I think it‚Äôs cool to see how great leadership plays out in the field of science.He also changed the world enormously with the atomic bomb. And so it‚Äôs the story of a technological innovator. It‚Äôs an interesting story of 20th century history. His story tells us a lot about WW2, democracy, fascism, communism, and the world that we have inherited.And I have loved learning about this story.My main sources are the books American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin and The Making of the Atomic Bomb by Richard Rhodes. If you want to read either of them, use the link in the show notes and you will be supporting the show.Also I should note, I‚Äôm releasing this a couple weeks after the release of the movie Oppenheimer, directed by Christopher Nolan. But I did this episode without reference to the movie. I‚Äôll be doing an end notes episode where I review the movie, discuss some of the history in it and what I liked and didn‚Äôt like and all that so watch for that next week. But for the purpose of this episode, I have just ignored the movie.And with that, let‚Äôs hop into the story, after this quick break. *** AD BREAK *** Early Life*** MUSIC CUE ***J Robert Oppenheimer‚Äôs life was shrouded in intrigue from the moment he entered the world. He was born on April 22nd, 1904 in New York City. He and his parents would always claim the J didn‚Äôt stand for anything.However, his birth certificate read Julius Robert Oppenheimer. His father‚Äôs name was Julius, and there was amongst Ashkenazi Jews at the time, a taboo against naming children after anyone living.Now I saw Ashkenazi Jews - Robert‚Äôs parents were Jewish immigrants from Germany, but they were not practicing Jews - they weren‚Äôt religious at all.They attended something called the Ethical Culture Society. And this was started by a Jewish guy named Felix Adler, and he was the son of a rabbi and probably would have been a Rabbi himself but he goes off to college and discovers rationalism and science and modern", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/oppenheimer", "title": "Oppenheimer", "chunk_index": 2, "publication_date": "2023-08-15", "total_chunks_in_doc": 26}}

And this was started by a Jewish guy named Felix Adler , and he was the son of a rabbi and probably would have been a Rabbi himself but he goes off to college and discovers rationalism and science and modern Oppenheimer: thinking.And so Adler thinks okay, this whole religion thing is small-minded. This is the way of the past, this is antiquated thinking. And so he has this desire to transcend his Jewishness and be a citizen of the world and so he starts this Ethical Culture Society thing, which is essentially just a secular synagogue and school. It even had an organ and weekly meetings that were definitely NOT worship meetings.And in the early 20th century, this is something that a lot of upper-middle class Jews will become interested in because it is a way to - at once - move beyond their Jewish identity to integrate with the rest of society, while also maintaining the connections and rhythms of life that they were used to.It allowed them the comforts of their religion without saddling them with its beliefs and the identity that went along with it.Robert attended the Ethical Culture school growing up, and it was a great environment for Robert to grow up in. It was open, curious, and intellectually stimulating.It was also very, very liberal. Graduates of the Ethical Culture School would go on to basically create the civil rights movement, and would end up creating the ACLU, the NAACP, and many of the women‚Äôs right and environmentalism groups in the United States as well.This will become important later but it was a very progressive background that Robert grew up in.He grew up with money, his father was a very successful businessman. Not like ‚Äúone of the richest people in the world‚Äù money but solidly rich. I think the fortune was valued at like 10-20 million inflation adjusted dollars.Robert was tall, extremely thin, and sort of a classic nerd. Uncoordinated, unathletic, extremely intelligent, shy and socially withdrawn.He is obviously a genius from early in his childhood. He just devours information. His biggest obsessions are with literature, building with toy blocks, and studying geology - he likes collecting rocks and geodes.At one point he starts corresponding via letters with a local New York geologist about some rock formations in Central Park, and the geologist says ‚Äúwow, you are clearly extremely knowledgeable about this, why don‚Äôt you come speak at our next meeting of the geology society‚Äù not realizing that he‚Äôs talking to a 13-year-old kid.And Robert‚Äôs dad hears about this and tells him he has to go. And they introduce their guest speaker J Robert Oppenheimer and they are all shocked when this 13-year-old gets up to speak. He gets bullied a little bit,", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/oppenheimer", "title": "Oppenheimer", "chunk_index": 3, "publication_date": "2023-08-15", "total_chunks_in_doc": 26}}
{"text": ". And Robert ‚Äô s dad hears about this and tells him he has to go . And they introduce their guest speaker J Robert Oppenheimer and they are all shocked when this 13 - year - old gets up to speak . He gets bullied a little bit , Oppenheimer: but in many ways the Ethical Culture Society is a refuge from any of that - they protect him there and nurture his intellectual growth.He has a teacher who takes an interest in him, named Herbert Smith, who takes him on a summer vacation to New Mexico with a couple other boys from the school to experience the great outdoors.And Robert falls in love with New Mexico, he is enthralled by the beauty of the western American landscape.He would make regular returns to New Mexico every summer for the next few years and would eventually buy a ranch there and spend significant time there.When Robert graduates from high school, he attends Harvard.And it‚Äôs a sign of just how intelligent he is, that Harvard is easy for him.He majors in chemistry, and he takes the maximum course load and audits 2-3 other classes just for fun.At one point, he wants to start taking upper-level physics courses because he‚Äôs becoming interested in physics, but he‚Äôs a chemistry major so he‚Äôs not allowed to.So he writes to the physics department and says this is why you should let me take these graduate level physics courses, I‚Äôm not majoring in physics, but here are the books I have read on physics - you‚Äôll see I‚Äôm well read on the topic and know my stuff and should be ready for these courses.So they read this letter in a faculty meeting and one professor, says ‚ÄúObviously if Oppenheimer says he‚Äôs read these books he‚Äôs a liar. But he should get a PhD just for knowing their titles.‚ÄùWell he wasn‚Äôt lying and shows himself to be a standout at physics.Now Robert knows he‚Äôs brilliant, and he has a huge ego about it. He himself admitted it.He later wrote ‚ÄúI developed an unpleasant ego, which I am sure must have affronted those who were unfortunate enough to come into contact with me.‚ÄùYou see this at Harvard, there is one story that I think illustrates it well. One of his physics professors, Percy Bridgman, is very impressed by Robert and invites him over for some tea.And as I mentioned, Robert had eclectic interests. He wasn‚Äôt just a science nerd. Bridgman knows this and shows him a photograph he took in Sicily of a temple built, he says in 400 BC.Instead of being impressed or complimenting the photograph, Oppenheimer disagrees with him. ‚ÄúLook at the capitals on the columns,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúthis could have been built no later", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/oppenheimer", "title": "Oppenheimer", "chunk_index": 4, "publication_date": "2023-08-15", "total_chunks_in_doc": 26}}

This is what he writes ‚ÄúHe has a perfectly prodigious power of assimilation. His weakness is on the experimental side. His type of mind is analytical rather than physical, and he is not at home in the manipulation of the laboratory. It appears to me that it is a bit of a gamble as to whether Oppeneheimer will ever make any real contributions of an important character. But if he does make good at all, I believe he will be a very unusual success.‚ÄùSo Oppeneheimer‚Äôs problem is that he is very good at theoretical physics. The theory, thinking about new ideas, making connections‚Ä¶ but he‚Äôs very bad at experimental physics. He‚Äôs clumsy and just horrible in actual experiments.And Cambridge is the center of the world for experimental physics.So when Robert shows up, he, for the first time, does not feel like the smartest person in the room anymore. In fact, he‚Äôs down right incompetent. And he starts floundering.*** MUSIC CUE ***The weather is cold and dreary, he has few social connections, and none at all with women, he‚Äôs doing poorly professionally, and he enters a deep deep depression.This depression causes him to act erratically.At one point he‚Äôs on a train and he‚Äôs stuck in a compartment, a room, with a couple who are making out. And eventually the man leaves, and when he‚Äôs gone, Oppenheimer kisses the woman on the mouth, and then gets up and runs away. He gets off at the next stop, and the couple does as well, and Oppenheimer sees them go down some stairs. Overcome by regret and shame, he tries to drop his luggage on the woman‚Äôs head, only barely missing her.And this isn‚Äôt even the worst thing he does.There is a professor named Blackett who is pushing Oppenheimer while he‚Äôs in this state, and eventually Robert snaps and poisons an apple on Blackett‚Äôs desk with lab chemicals.He confesses before Blackett eats the apple, but Robert is put on academic probation and has to regularly go see a psychiatrist in London.It doesn‚Äôt help.

His parents come to visit , and at one point he locks Oppenheimer: his mom in her hotel room and leaves her there for hours.Even his parents recognize that his total lack of romantic success is one reason for his depression and so they bring with them a girl from the Ethical Culture Society to try to set them up and spark some sort of romance.Well eventually Robert gets in bed with her, but he can‚Äôt work up the courage to actually do anything so he starts crying, and then she starts crying, and then his mom hears them crying and starts pounding on the door saying ‚ÄúRobert, I can hear you‚Äôre in there. Come out now, Robert.‚ÄùThe culmination of this psychotic period of his life is when his good friend Ferguson tells Robert that he‚Äôs engaged, and Robert tries to strangle him with a luggage strap.This is like stuff out of a novel. Total and complete mental meltdown.So my takeaway from this part of his life is‚Ä¶ look people often say there is a thin line between genius and madness, and that might be true, but Robert actually wasn‚Äôt mad, he was a pretty mentally healthy person for much of the rest of his life.My main takeaway is just that even the greats sometimes go through really hard times and can go into really bad places mentally. And so if you‚Äôre really going through something mentally, it‚Äôs probably not as bad as what J Robert Oppenheimer went through and it definitely doesn‚Äôt mean that you can‚Äôt go on to accomplish great things.So if you‚Äôre in that phase of your life, and you have horrible issues. I promise you, it‚Äôs not as bad as what Oppenheimer went through. You can come out on the other side of this and have a successful life, just hang on.Well two things happen to pull him out of this. One is he goes to Corsica and bikes around the island. He never fully says what happens there, but he intimates that he had some sort of revelation or transformation on this trip to Corsica.It‚Äôs also at this time that he meets Niels Bohr.He had begun to read Bohr‚Äôs work and was becoming a big fan. And he walks in one day to one of his professor‚Äôs office, and Bohr is there, talking to the professor.The professor introduces them and Bohr, who was good looking, funny, and easy to be around, asks Oppenheimer ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs it going?‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in difficulties,‚Äù Oppenheimer respondedBohr asked ‚ÄúAre the difficulties mathematical or", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/oppenheimer", "title": "Oppenheimer", "chunk_index": 6, "publication_date": "2023-08-15", "total_chunks_in_doc": 26}}

There‚Äôs another way. He wrote:‚ÄúAt that point I forgot about beryllium and films and decided to try to learn the trade of being a theoretical physicist. By that time I was fully aware that it was an unusual time - that great things were afoot.‚ÄùSo at this point, after a little less than a year at Cambridge, he decides to go to Gottingen, Germany.Sometimes you just have to gut out hard times and power through challenges, but other times you need to just move on and find the place where you will thrive. And for Oppenheimer, in Gottingen he finds the place where he can thrive. *** MUSICAL CUE *** His success as a theoretical physicist really becomes apparent as soon as he arrives in Gottingen. Max Born is the director of the institute of theoretical physics at Gottingen, and Oppenheimer quickly becomes his favorite student.So much so that other students begin to become jealous of him.He also succeeds socially for the first time. He‚Äôs one of the few students with money at Gottingen so he‚Äôs able to distinguish himself that way, with his clothes and his car.And so he‚Äôs romantically successful for the first time in Gottingen. That‚Äôs not a euphemism. Although maybe it is. If I had to guess, I would guess that Gottingen is the place where he is first romantically successful in both senses of that phrase.After a year in Gottingen, he goes on to study in the Netherlands and Switzerland. One of my favorite stories is that Oppeneheimer was very gifted at learning languages. And so when he shows up in the Netherlands to the university of Leiden, he quickly starts learning Dutch and everyone is amazed when he give his first lecture in Dutch after only a few weeks.

I do have to point out that he already Oppenheimer: spoke German, which is a very closely related language, but still, a very remarkable accomplishment. So this is a real time of flourishing for him. He‚Äôs publishing papers, he‚Äôs collaborating with some of the greatest physicists in the world, and he‚Äôs making a name for himself.Now, even though he‚Äôs doing well, not everyone is happy with Oppeneheimer. One of the people he reminds me most of is Da Vinci. H doesn‚Äôt like to be pigeon-holed and he doesn‚Äôt like to stay focused on one thing for a long period of time. He‚Äôs very intellectually curious, and he loves to move from problem to problem, often without fully solving any of them. So he was a very good collaborator, good at bringing ideas together, great at finding and pointing out new areas to explore, but not great at the type of in-depth research that wins you a nobel prize, and in fact, he never did win a nobel prize. And he‚Äôs widely considered the greatest physicist of his era never to have won a Nobel prize.In a fit of frustration with Oppenheimer, Max Born wrote of him that he was ‚ÄúDoubtless very gifted, but completely without mental discipline. He's outwardly very modest, but inwardly very arrogant.‚ÄùAfter finishing his studies in Europe, he then goes to California where he takes teaching jobs at CalTech and Cal Berkeley.He had the option of going to any number of very prestigious schools to teach, but he loved California, he loved the weather and the sense of openness. He loved it for the same reasons he loved New Mexico, Robert Oppenheimer was a person who felt at home in the American west.He founds the theoretical physics department at Cal Berkeley. There was already a very prestigious experimental physics department, run by Ernest Lawrence, but this was their first foray into theoretical physics.At first, Oppenheimer is a horrible teacher. He just follows his own thoughts and mumbles his way through lectures, often going over material that was way over the understanding of his students.But he eventually becomes a good teacher, even a great teacher. He starts attracting some of the best and most promising students to Berkeley.One physicist, Bethe, explained how he became a teacher, writing‚ÄúProbably the most important ingredient he brought to his teaching was his exquisite taste. He always knew what were the important problems as shown by his choice of subjects.

He truly lived with those problems , struggling for a solution , and he communicated his concern to Oppenheimer: his group. He was interested in everything, and in one afternoon, he and his students might discuss quantum electrodynamics, cosmic rays, electron pair production, and nuclear physics.‚ÄùAnd so Oppenheimer has made it. He‚Äôs a good teacher, he‚Äôs living out west in California. He‚Äôs starting to become known as a womanizer. He‚Äôs very successful romantically. But it was at this moment that he would sow the seeds of his own destruction. And we‚Äôll hear all about it, after this break. *** AD BREAK *** As Oppenheimer‚Äôs teaching and academic career is reaching an all-time high, he starts to become politically aware for the first time. There are a few reasons for this.The first is the Great Depression. To many people at the time, the economic system of the United States and of the west in general seemed broken. The 1930s were the all-time peak for actual overt communism in the United States. And it‚Äôs largely for this reason.Another reason is that Hitler comes to power in 1933. And for Oppenheimer, the rise of Nazism is not just a news story. He had studied in Germany only a few years before. Physics was a very Jewish field, the majority of top physicists were Jewish, and Oppenheimer had studied in Germany, so many of his friends were Jewish physicists living in Germany. And one of the first moves of the Nazi regime is to expel Jewish academics from German universities.So Oppenheimer‚Äôs personal friends are being expelled. And also if you remember, both of his parents are German Jewish immigrants, so he‚Äôs got aunts and uncles in Germany who are suffering persecutions.Another thing that pushes him toward radical leftwing politics is the Spanish Civil War, which starts in 1936, which was a civil war between a right-wing military junta and a Soviet-backed communist insurgency. In America, it was often portrayed as brave patriotic Republicans against a fascist overthrow - especially in leftwing circles - although that wasn‚Äôt actually the case.But American leftists were very moved by this conflict and they really mobilized support for the Spanish communists. Thousands of people volunteered to go fight with them, including Ernest Hemmingway.Add to all of this, Oppenheimer‚Äôs natural inclinations toward leftism because he had been educated at the Ethical Culture Society and he was an American Jew at a time when the Jewish cultural default was to be strongly leftist. Especially among Jewish American academics, which is what he was.So Oppenheimer becomes a communist.

Especially among Jewish American academics , which is what he was . So Oppenheimer becomes a communist . He Oppenheimer: starts dating a communist girl named Jean Tatlock, he attends labor meetings and communist reading groups. He speaks at communist rallies and meetings. It‚Äôs very obvious that he is intellectually a communist.But the question arises, was he actually a communist party member?And there is evidence on both sides.On the one hand, he never had a communist party card and he was never on their official roles. So, no.But on the other hand, he did regularly attend this group. It was essentially a reading and discussion group. And the FBI through a wiretap was able to discover that this was, according to the communist party, a secret cell. A secret chapter of the communist party. Secret because these people were prominent. People like Oppenheimer who wanted to be able to continue to influence society and maintain their positions.Add to that the fact that Oppeneheimer paid party dues to the communist party. His later claim would be that he was donating to the Spanish Civil War, and that he was told that the most efficient way to get donations to the communists in Spain was through the American Communist Party.The only problem is he made these contributions until 1942, and the Spanish Civil War ended in 1939. When pressed on this, he said that he was making contributions to various other causes through the communist party after the Spanish Civil War ended.But it is a little weird that for all of these various causes he wanted to donate the exact same amount every month. It looks much more like party dues than it does like ad hoc contributions.Oppenheimer would claim that he was merely a fellow traveler. Someone who believed in communism, but chose to remain independent of the communist party and was not subject to party discipline.And I think this well may be the case. Robert always had this acute need to feel important . And he never liked to be a cog in the machine. It seems unlikely that the communist party would be the one exception where he says, I accept all of this unthinkingly, I‚Äôm just a loyal foot soldier.So there is a scenario in which the leader of this secret cell never pushes that this is an official communist party meeting. He just emphasizes that it‚Äôs an intellectual discussion group for like-minded people.And at the same time, he is representing to the communist party that it is an official group, because then he gets the credit for bringing a group of impressive people like Oppeneheimer into the party.But at the end of the day, all of these people paid dues.

But at the end of the day , all of these people paid dues . I think Oppenheimer: that‚Äôs the sticking point, and the thing that convinces me at the end of the day that Oppenheimer was a secret communist party member during the late 1930s and early 1940s.His brother Frank at this time did officially join the communist party, and Robert gave him a hard time about it. But in this context, it seems less about him Robert having qualms with the communist party, and more about him having qualms with Frank being indiscreet and closing off future career opportunities.As one colleague later put it, he said he didn‚Äôt know if Oppie was ever an actual party member, but it wouldn‚Äôt have made much of a difference. He was so involved in radical progressive causes, in unions and civil rights groups and things like that, that whether he was an official member of the communist party or not, everyone knew where he stood.Oppenheimer‚Äôs politics were important to him. He found a lot of meaning in them. But they would soon become an issue for him.Because in 1941, the president of the United States, FDR, authorized research into the development of a nuclear bomb. This was two months before Pearl Harbor, but FDR was already looking for ways to get America involved in the war and was beginning preparations.One of the early scientists on the project was Oppenheimer‚Äôs partner at Berkeley, Ernest Lawrence.Lawrence was a Republican Christian who grew up in a small town in South Dakota, and he ran the experimental physics department at Berkeley. He was one of the top experimental physicists in the United States and in the world.And he and Oppenheimer had a sort of odd-couple friendship. Lawrence was always trying to get Oppenheimer to cut out his radical leftward politics, especially once the bomb project was kicking off, because he wanted Robert involved.He disagreed with Oppeneheimer politically, but he thought he was essential to developing the atomic bomb in time for use in the war.The early committees on atomic research are skeptical of Oppenheimer‚Äôs politics, but Lawrence vouches for him and people keep talking to him anyway, because he is a great physicist with a great mind. And so ultimately the government decides to bring him into the project and give him a security clearance. Both because Lawrence vouches for him and they think he will be valuable, and also because he‚Äôs a security risk and they decide they‚Äôll be able to keep better tabs on him if he‚Äôs inside than if he‚Äôs on the outside where they can‚Äôt monitor him.Oppenheimer quickly proves himself to be a very valuable", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/oppenheimer", "title": "Oppenheimer", "chunk_index": 11, "publication_date": "2023-08-15", "total_chunks_in_doc": 26}}

And that makes him a natural leader.Now having said that, Oppenheimer was not a universally beloved choice as the head physicist to lead the project. Some objected that he hadn‚Äôt led anything before. Others pointed to the fact that he didn‚Äôt have a Nobel prize.Oppenheimer had done a lot of very important research and published a lot of important papers, but he had never done the kind of in-depth research that earns you a Nobel. It was part of his habit of flitting from topic to topic.So the US government worried if he would carry enough gravitas in order to lead a bunch of scientists who had won nobel prizes.The man who would be deciding on the lead physicist was an army officer named Colonel Leslie Groves.Colonel Groves was six feet tall and 250 pounds. One colleague described him this way.‚ÄúHe is most demanding. He is most critical. He is always a driver, never a praiser. He is abrasive and sarcastic. He disregards all normal organization channels. He is extremely intelligent. He has the guts to make timely, difficult decisions. He is the most egotistical man I know. I hated his guts, and so did everybody else. But we had our form of understanding.‚ÄùAnd that seems to be how everyone felt about Groves. Almost no one liked him, but just about everyone respected him.Oppenheimer said about him ‚ÄúOh yes, Groves is a bastard, but he's a straightforward one.‚ÄùHe was chosen for his experience, for his intelligence - Groves had studied engineering at MIT - and for his ability to get things done.Groves was absolutely crucial to the Manhattan Project, and the relationship between him and Oppenheimer was one of those magical unions that spurred both to greater things.It was the combination of Oppenheimer‚Äôs sheer brilliance, and Groves‚Äôs unmatched ability to get things done.The day after he was put in charge of the Manhattan project, Groves purchased 1,200 pounds of Uranium. That was who he was. Hard charging. Abrasive, but he got things done.Well - Groves meets Oppenehimer and he is charmed.‚ÄúHe's a genius,‚Äù Groves later told a reporter ‚ÄúA real genius. Oppenheimer knows about everything. He can talk to you about anything you bring up. Well, not exactly. I guess there are a few things he doesn't know about, he doesn't know anything about", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/oppenheimer", "title": "Oppenheimer", "chunk_index": 12, "publication_date": "2023-08-15", "total_chunks_in_doc": 26}}

I guess there are a few things he doesn ' t know about , he doesn ' t know anything about Oppenheimer: sports.‚ÄùSo this wide-ranging knowledge charms Groves. He also saw that Oppenheimer had strong interpersonal skills and communication skills.Some have also suggested that he liked that Oppenheimer had security concerns. His communist past made him easier to control, as Groves could always hold it over his head that he could revoke his security clearance.And lastly, one reason to choose Oppenheimer: He was one of the top physicists whose research wasn‚Äôt necessary on the project. In other words his colleague Lawrence was considered, but Lawrence couldn‚Äôt spare the time to lead because he couldn‚Äôt spare the research time. His actual research was going to be crucial to building the bomb. The same could be said for many leading physicists, but not for Oppenheimer.So Oppenehimer was made the head of the secret weapons lab for the Manhattan project.And despite all those nice things I just said about him, at first, Oppenheimer was a complete and total disaster as a leader. We‚Äôll hear why after this break‚Ä¶ *** AD BREAK *** In the early days of the war, the perception was that the United States was two years behind the Germans in developing an atomic bomb. The US had taken a long time to get involved in the war, and consequently had started nuclear research later and with less urgency.A German, Otto Hahn, had been the first to discover nuclear fission in 1938, so that gave them an obvious head start.One of the leaders of the nuclear project in Germany was a brilliant physicist named Werner Heisenberg. He and Oppenheimer had known each other in Gottingen. They had been friendly, though competitive. They had even gone after the same girl at one point. Heisenberg was not a Nazi, but he considered it his patriotic duty to stay and offer his services to his home country.There was a wall of secrecy around Germany, but the impression was that Heisenberg and his colleagues had been doing top notch research on building an atomic bomb for years.So Oppenheimer is working with urgency. He‚Äôs trying to make up for lost time. But he‚Äôs doing a horrible job.It wasn‚Äôt so much that he was doing something wrong, he wasn‚Äôt doing much of anything.One physicist complained that Oppenheimer ‚Äúhadn‚Äôt run so much as a lemonade stand‚Äù and now it was showing.He didn‚Äôt know the basics of putting together an organization and running it.The project operated for weeks without so much as an organization chart or a schedule.

The project operated for weeks without so much as an organization chart or a schedule . Finally , Groves marched into Oppenheimer‚Äôs office and demanded he write down an org chart.Oppenheimer reluctantly drew out four boxes: Theoretical physics, experimental physics, metallurgy, and ordnance. He also wrote out a name to head up each division. In charge of the theoretical physics division, he wrote his own name.With time, Oppenheimer slowly improved as a leader. A real turning point came when he realized that he needed to fire himself as the head of the theoretical physics department. He couldn‚Äôt be the leader of the project and an individual contributor and researcher.He would have to choose, and he chose his role in leadership.After this change, leadership was no longer a thing that got in the way of his research, but was itself the focus of his incredible mental faculties.It is unsurprising that once he decided to focus on leadership, a genius like Oppneheimer was able to master it.He ends up having something they call ‚ÄúThe Oppenheimer Effect‚Äù - whenever he enters a room, people want to step up, want to do their best.One physicist, Edward Teller, described his leadership this way ‚ÄúThroughout the war years, Oppie knew in detail what was going on in every part of the laboratory. He was incredibly quick and perceptive in analyzing human as well as technical problems. Of the more than 10, 000 people who eventually came to work at Los Alamos, Oppie knew several hundred intimately, by which I mean that he knew what their relationships with one another were, and what made them tick.He knew how to organize, cajole, humor, soothe feelings, how to lead powerfully without seeming to do so. He is an exemplar of dedication, a hero who never lost his humanness. Disappointing him somehow carried with it a sense of wrongdoing. Alamo's amazing success grew out of the brilliance, enthusiasm, and charisma with which Oppenheimer led it.‚ÄùHe‚Äôs also very good at building consensus, and mediating conversations.One colleague, David Hawkins, wrote this ‚ÄúHe was very persuasive. Very cogent. Elegant in language and able to listen to what other people said and incorporate it into what he would say. I had the impression that he was a good politician in the sense that if several people spoke, he could summarize what they said and as a result they would realize they agreed with each other.

He and Groves agreed that it should be a remote site due to security concerns . Somewhere where it would Oppenheimer: be easy to keep an eye on all of the scientists.Oppenheimer, sly devil that he was, goes on a trip to New Mexico and proposes the location of Los Alamos, as though he has never seen the place before. In reality, it was less than 50 miles from his ranch.The fact that it was very remote made Los Alamos not only good for security but also good for testing, it was surrounded by open deserts where bombs could be set off without impacting civilians.Of course, the thing that made it a good site for research also presented some difficulties. The only thing that existed previous to the research facility was a boys school. An entire town had to be built from scratch for six thousand people - complete with homes, sewers, electricity, offices, recreational facilities, schools, and medical facilities - not to mention laboratories, testing sites, chemistry labs, and all of the things that went into the actual mission.Los Alamos could be a pressure cooker, but it also created an incredible sense of camaraderie. Alcohol flowed freely. There wasn‚Äôt much to do other than work and drink. So people worked a lot, and they drank a lot.In such a pressure cooker, it was often important to massage bruised egos, mediate disputes, and offer encouragement.One of the really important things he had to do was manage security concerns. The attitude of the army was that all information should be separated and siloed. There basically shouldn‚Äôt be inter-departmental communication between the rank and file because everything should be kept strictly on a confidential need-to-know basis.Oppenheimer pushed back on this, rightly pointing out that this lack of communication made rapid research impossible. The scientists needed to be able to communicate and share findings freely if they were going to be able to finish a nuclear bomb in time for use in the war.Now, these security concerns were to keep secrets out of the hands of the Soviets, who were ostensibly allies in the second world war, but not very comfortable ones. The seeds of the cold war were laid far before WW2, and so most of these security efforts were made not to keep secrets out of the hands of the Nazis, who had no effective espionage program in the United States, but from the Soviets.And this presented a major challenge, since many of the physicists had, like Oppenheimer, been communists. This is because, they‚Äôre academics, it had been the 1930s, and let‚Äôs face it, because they‚Äôre Jewish.So the army is eyeing", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/oppenheimer", "title": "Oppenheimer", "chunk_index": 15, "publication_date": "2023-08-15", "total_chunks_in_doc": 26}}

So the army is eyeing Oppenheimer: these guys suspiciously and putting in measures that are hampering them from doing their work. So it‚Äôs easy to see the army as the bad guys, stopping progress on this research.But it‚Äôs worth pointing out that in fact, all of the nuclear secrets did end up leaking from the American program. The Soviets did not independently invent the atom bomb. They stole the plans from the American program. There were leaks all over the place, including in Oppenheimer‚Äôs own team.And so in that context, one could argue that actually the army was correct, and Oppenheimer was wrong.I would just say that they were both right. The army was right about what it would take to keep nuclear secrets out of Soviet hands, and Oppenheimer was right that they would be unable to develop a bomb in time for use in WW2 with such restrictions in place.Robert initially estimated that Los Alamos would require the work of 50 physicists and 50 technicians. However, by the end of the war, nearly 10,000 people were living and working at Los Alamos.And you just couldn‚Äôt keep a lid on that many people and stop them from communicating.Secret SauceThey are able to develop an atomic bomb before the Germans, before the Japanese, and before the Soviets. In part that‚Äôs because the conditions were just so different.So, Niels Bohr and, uh, Edward Teller had a disagreement about, uh, whether U 235 could be separated from U 238. And Niels Bohr said, no, it's impossible. You can only do it by turning the country into a giant factory. Years later, writes Edward Teller, when Bohr came to Los Alamos, I was prepared to say, you see.But before I could open my mouth, he said, you see, I told you it couldn't be done without turning the whole country into a factory. You have done just that.Oppenheimer was able to see how the science fit with this industrial project. Oppenheimer was probably the best lab director I have ever seen because of the great mobility of his mind, because of the successful effort to know about practically everything important invented in the laboratory. And also the psychological insight into other people, which in the country is very much the exception.He knew and understood everything that went on in the laboratory. Whether it was chemistry or theoretical physics or machine shop. He could keep it all in his head and coordinate it. It was clear also at Los Alamos that he was intellectually related to us.

It was clear also at Los Alamos that he was intellectually related to us . And he understood immediately Oppenheimer: when he heard anything.And fitted it into the general scheme to write conclusions. There was just nobody else in the laboratory who came even close to him. In his knowledge, it was human warmth as well. Everybody certainly had the impression that he cared what each particular person was doing. Talking to someone, he made it clear that that person's work was important for the success of the whole project.But even with his leadership, there are technical issues.One of the big ones is the firing mechanism.Moral/Ethical QualmsFrom the beginning of the project there were ethical qualms about building a bomb with such terrifying destructive power. Such a bomb would necessarily involve civilian casualties in its use.Isidor Rabi, a friend of Oppeneheimer‚Äôs and a fellow physicist, refused to join the project full time because of his reservations, though he did offer some advice as a part-time consultant.Many of the physicists urged openness and transparency with the Soviet Union, especially those like Oppenheimer who had communist sympathies. But it wasn‚Äôt just because they wanted to help the Soviet Union, though there may have been some of that, but for men like Oppenheimer, they could see where things were headed. They anticipated the cold war with its build up of massive amounts of nuclear weapons, and they could see that such large nuclear arsenals had the power to destroy the world as we know it.So there were reservations throughout the Manhattan Project, but they were relatively muted, at first.But then, in mid-1944 as it became clear that Germany was going to lose the war, the voices of dissent started to grow louder.Many of the physicists were Jewish, and they held special disdain for Germany. Some of them were themselves European exiles who had fled Nazi persecution. They had wanted to drop the bomb on German civilians, not on Japanese civilians. And it was becoming clear that the bomb would not be ready in time to use against Germany.One physicist wrote ‚ÄúWe had been too late. Now that the bomb could not be used against the Nazis, doubts arose.‚ÄùLeo Szilard, the physicist who first urged FDR to initiate a nuclear program, now opposed their use on Japan, and after Hitler‚Äôs suicide, sought a meeting with Truman to try to squash their development.He was also very worried by the idea of an arms race with the Soviets. You see this fundamental disconnect between leftists, who see the Soviet Union and United States as fundamentally going after the same thing by different means, and rightists who see the Soviet Union", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/oppenheimer", "title": "Oppenheimer", "chunk_index": 17, "publication_date": "2023-08-15", "total_chunks_in_doc": 26}}

You see this fundamental disconnect between leftists , who see the Soviet Union and United States as fundamentally going after the same thing by different means , and rightists who see the Soviet Union Oppenheimer: as totally different from and opposed to the American way of life.After all, none of these people saw an arms race with Nazi Germany as a bad thing. They only oppose it with the Soviet Union.The same could be said of Oppenheimer.And yet he rallied the scientists to finish the project. He made a number of arguments, including that maybe, just maybe, this bomb would actually end warfare, by making it too terrible to engage in lightly.‚ÄúImprove the international prospects, in that they are more concerned with the prevention of war than with the elimination of this specific weapon. We find ourselves closer to these latter views; we can propose no technical demonstration likely to bring an end to the war; we see no acceptable alternative to direct military use.‚ÄùAnd there is some evidence that this might be the case. Since the end of WW2 there hasn‚Äôt been a war between the nuclear armed great powers. And previous to WW2 the world‚Äôs great powers were going to war all the time.Oppenheimer was at the committee meeting where targeting was worked out. It was decided that the bomb was overkill for a military strike, that it should be used on an industrial target, surrounded by civilians in order that a large number of people would see it and it would make a psychological impression.The official language was ‚ÄúA vital war plant employing a large number of workers and closely surrounded by workers‚Äôs houses.‚ÄùOppenheimer gave some thought to the idea of inviting the Japanese to the first ever nuclear test. The only trouble was, it was a test, and no one knew if it would work. And if the bomb didn‚Äôt work, the Japanese might be even more emboldened to hold out.‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt know beans about the military situation in Japan. We didn't know whether they could be caused gto surrender by other means or whether the invasion was really inevitable. But in the backs of our minds was the notion that the invasion was inevitable because we had been told that.‚ÄùEisenhower thought the atomic bomb use in Japan was unnecessary because ‚Äúthe Japanese were ready to surrender and it wasn‚Äôt necessary to hit them with that awful thing.‚ÄùEisenhower not exactly known as a peace-nik. So if the Japanese were trying to surrender, why was the bomb used?Well they were trying to get a negotiated surrender, and the United States wanted an unconditional surrender.I think the other thing is, you know I mentioned that the Jewish physicists wanted to use the bomb on the Germans", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/oppenheimer", "title": "Oppenheimer", "chunk_index": 18, "publication_date": "2023-08-15", "total_chunks_in_doc": 26}}

I think the other thing is , you know I mentioned that the Jewish physicists wanted to use the bomb on the Germans Oppenheimer: because they were motivated by revenge and racial hatred. And I find that understandable but regrettable.Well I think you can say the same of the mostly gentile military leadership of the US. They had this same revenge and racial hatred thing going on toward the Japanese because of Pearl Harbor.And look, I don‚Äôt mean to condemn anyone too harshly here. I think the use of the atom bomb in Japan was a bad decision. I agree with Eisenhower that a negotiated peace might have been possible and should have been pursued harder. But the fog of war applies. There was no guarantee that negotiations would have been successful. And the Soviets had declared war on Japan. Every day of delay brought them closer to Japan. If the US had delayed, you might have ended up with a divided Japan like you see in Korea.And that would have been a real tragedy.There were a lot of discussions at Los Alamos. One physicist, Edward Teller, circulated a petition that no bomb should be dropped without a public statement of the terms of surrender that they were refusing.But at the end of the day, the truth was that the US diplomatic and military organizations viewed the advice of the physicists as little more than a curiosity. Huh. Interesting. Thanks, we‚Äôll really think about that.The only thing the physicists could have done was a complete strike or I guess sabotage the development of the bomb. The consequences of either of those two actions would have been very dire. We‚Äôre talking about long prison sentences.In the end, the decision came from the top. President Truman decided that the bomb would be dropped.An important deadline was set. A test needed to be conducted before the Potsdam conference on July 17, 1945. The heads of state of the allied powers would be there to work out the details of a new post-war world order.It was thought that the United States possessing an atomic weapon would give them powerful negotiating leverage at the conference.And so Oppenheimer had his marching orders. One final push to have the bomb ready for testing by mid-July. *** MUSIC CUE ***Final Testing and UseThe Summer of 1945 was intense. It was a particularly hot summer in New Mexico, and Oppenheimer drove his scientists to work harder and longer hours.Everyone seemed on edge.

Explosions on the Plateau seemed to increase and then to cease . ‚Äù The bomb was nearing Oppenheimer: completion, and was almost ready to test.For a test site, Oppenheimer selected an open patch of desert that the local Mexicans had called the ‚ÄúJornada del Muerto‚Äù the journey of death.Oppenheimer dubbed the test site ‚ÄúTrinity‚Äù although he could never quite explain where the name came from.Again, Robert did have some hesitations about the bomb, and the way it was being used. But all of that was pushed out of his mind by the immediacy of completing the project on a tight deadline.All of his thoughts were turned toward making sure the bomb worked, and that it was completed on time. *** DO I LITERALLY REPLAY THE TEST SCENE FROM THE BEGINNING? I THINK I DO. *** According to Robert Oppenheimer‚Äôs brother, Frank, Robert‚Äôs only words after the blast were ‚Äúit worked.‚ÄùHis friend and physicist Rabi saw Robert shortly thereafter. He was buoyant. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never forget his walk;‚Äù Rabi recalled ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never forget the way he stepped out of the car‚Ä¶ his walk was like High Noon‚Ä¶ this kind of strut. He had done it.‚ÄùRobert Oppenheimer is often quoted as saying ‚ÄúI remembered the line from the Hindu scripture the Bhagavad-Gita - ‚ÄòNow I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.‚Äô‚ÄùAnd this is widely understood to be an expression of regret. But I want to read the whole quote.‚ÄúWe knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried. Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita; Vishnu is trying to persuade the prince that he should do his duty, and to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says, ‚ÄòNow I am become death, the destroyed of worlds.‚Äô I supposed we all thought that, one way or another.‚ÄùSo in other words, this was not an expression of unvarnished horror, but rather a continuation of his line of reasoning of hoping that this new tool would awe the world into doing the right thing and bringing an end to this war and hopefully soon to all wars.The attitude back at Los Alamos was euphoric. Robert was euphoric too.Though in the coming days he would have growing reservations about the bombs use, he never disavowed his work, and in fact he helped advise the airforce on how to use the bomb.Having said that, at least one person did catch him in his office, puffing on his pipe and muttering", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/oppenheimer", "title": "Oppenheimer", "chunk_index": 20, "publication_date": "2023-08-15", "total_chunks_in_doc": 26}}

It‚Äôs been a long road.‚Äù *** Musical cue***DenouementOppenhimer became a celebrity. That year he was put on the cover of Time magazine. He was a war hero, and even more than that he was the model of the modern man of science.He was older now, and it had now been years since he had done serious physics research. Rather than going back into academia, he spent increasing time in Washington as a nuclear advisor and member of the Atomic Energy Commission.Eventually, he took a job as the director of Princeton‚Äôs Institute of Advanced Study, where he oversaw a multidisciplinary program that welcomed scholars from many disciplines who were doing world changing research, men like Einstein, and John Von Nuemann.As the cold war progressed, more and more scrutiny was placed on those with communist ties. People like Oppenheimer.This time period became known as the red scare, although truth be told, now that the soviet union has fallen and we have access to all of those documents, Joseph McCarthy was basically right, and if anything might have understated the problem. The US government was absolutely infested with communists.And in fact, we now know that there were four spies who were directly transmitting top secret information under Oppenheimer‚Äôs nose from Los Alamos.There were individuals who were treated unfairly, but it probably made sense to root out as many people with communist ties from the government as possible.And in that context, Oppenheimer was cooked.He had been a secret party member, he had associated with communists, he his wife had been a communist, he had multiple communist lovers.There is some evidence that he himself actually might have been a Soviet spy. I‚Äôll go over that evidence in the end notes episode, ultimately I don‚Äôt find it persuasive and I don‚Äôt think he himself directly spied for the USSR, but he was certainly a security risk, and it‚Äôs understandable why you might want to have him removed from sensitive information when his contributions were no longer strictly necessary and his communist sympathies", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/oppenheimer", "title": "Oppenheimer", "chunk_index": 21, "publication_date": "2023-08-15", "total_chunks_in_doc": 26}}

Media outlets eventually picked up on it, and it made him a martyr.Stripped of any influence within government, Robert became a public figure and advocate for scientific inquiry generally. He gave speeches, wrote articles, and talked with the powerful and influential, but with increasingly little real impact.He purchased land on the US Caribbean island of St John, where he spent an increasing amount of time.In terms of his appearance, Oppenheimer was famous for two things, one was his hat. All the great ones have a signature look, and he was no different. And the other was his constant smoking. He smoked cigarettes and pipe tobacco all the time.Well in 1965 he was diagnosed with lung cancer which progressed relatively rapidly.He died on February 18, 1967.LessonsCome join the madnessT-shaped skillsSetting apart a spaceThe way he would build up weaker and push the stronger performersDensity of talentIt can be difficult to take too many lessons from a genuine genius.

He also had cousins and an aunt and an uncle who were in Germany who were suffering.Then there is the matter of the Spanish civil war. Which became a cause celebre amongst liberals. Oppenheimer started donating to the civil war.There was also the fact of the great depression.

{"text": "Walt Disney: Hello, and welcome to how to take over the world. This is Ben Wilson. Got an exciting episode for you today. We're talking about Walt Disney. And why Walt? Well, there are a number of different angles that you can look at well from. You can look at his success as an entrepreneur, as a guy who just founded one of the, I think, 50 largest companies in the world. Uh, worth billions and billions of dollars. You can look at him as a storyteller as probably the greatest storyteller of the 20th century. You know, a lot of the stories that we live with now that are a part of mass culture come from the Disney company and come from things that, that he started and patterns that he set out. So you can look at him as. Uh, storyteller, you can look at him as a rags to riches story. You know, he came from literally nowhere grew up in Missouri. , in the United States did not come from wealthy family. Um, you know, someone who just took nothing. And was able to establish one of the most iconic companies of all time. You can look at wall as an innovator, you can look at him as an artist. Um, he really is at the nexus of technology, art business. And so no matter what you're looking for, I think you can see something in Walt Disney. He's, he's one of the great Americans of the 20th century. And he's got a great story. So I'm excited to dive into it. But before we do here is a brief word from our sponsors. Have you ever heard the urban legend that Walt Disney was cryogenically frozen? It's not true, but it was a pretty common urban legend at least back when I was in elementary and middle school. They would say that he was frozen with the hope that future advances in medical technology would allow him to be resuscitated and resurrected someday. Well, again, This never happened, but while Walt Disney never froze his body, you should be freezing yours. And that's because cold exposure and cold baths specifically have been shown to have a number of positive health benefits. It's good for your hair and skin. Good for your mood and concentration.

He had virtually no memories of Chicago as a little boy, because when he was four years old, Uh, his father decided that Chicago was not particularly safe and the neighborhood that they were growing up in was not particularly good. And in fact, the notorious gangster Al Capone. Uh, it was sort of a famous mafia, man. Uh, he would later set up his headquarters in that same neighborhood that Walt was growing up in. So that became too much for Walt's father Elias. And so, um, there was an incident that pushed him over the edge. , two local boys killed a policeman in a robbery gone wrong. So while it was four years old and Elias Disney decides to move his family. To Marcy, Helene, Missouri, small frontier railroad town, a hundred miles Northeast of Kansas city. Elias bought a small farm there. And he worked hard and he worked his sons really hard. He had them help with all the household tasks. The Disneys came from a long line of schemers and failed businessmen. It's actually remarkable to see how many failed schemes and businesses they had over multiple generations. Elias's father Keppel had tried to drill for oil, but failed to find any. Then he set out for California in search of gold, but gave up before he even got there. And then settled for a farm in Kansas, which turned out to be very difficult to manage and unprofitable until the very end. So Elias Walt's father grew up on the edge of poverty for his entire childhood. He himself would undertake a number of ventures during his lifetime, just like his father. And they would all end in failure, justice as fathers had. And you kind of have two things happening at the same time here, Elias his determination to not follow his father's pattern of failure made him extremely diligent and hardworking, but the fact that he failed, despite all that hard work made him bitter and angry. Oftentimes he was", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/walt-disney", "title": "Walt Disney", "chunk_index": 1, "publication_date": "2022-03-31", "total_chunks_in_doc": 35}}
{"text": "two things happening at the same time here , Elias his determination to not follow his father ' s pattern of failure made him extremely diligent and hardworking , but the fact that he failed , despite all that hard work made him bitter and angry . Oftentimes he was Walt Disney: a very severe man. He was very religious was described in one book as quote, nearly humorless. He worked hard. He believed in an old school approach to parenting. That involved. Uh, corporal punishment beating his children and he never showed outward affection towards them at all. Now I should say. They can get exaggerated. Sometimes he would punish his sons by hitting them with a switch or the wooden handle of his hammer. Um, or with his bare hands. But Elias was not sending Walt to school with black eyes and broken ribs. So sometimes you'll hear. You know, Walt Disney's father beat him with a hammer. Yes. With the handle of a hammer. It's still not great. Right? But, but he's not like you could kill someone with. Hitting him with a hammer with, with the end of the hammer. With the handle, it's more of a, like a spanking. He was a severe disciplinarian. Um, but I have not seen any indications that it was to the point of harming his children's health. Nevertheless it wasn't great. And I've seen some say that Walt hated his father. And I think that's actually true. You read some of the things he said and you think, okay, this does sound like someone who maybe hated his father. But you read some of the other things he said, and it sounds like he loved and admired his father. So, which is it? And I think the answer is both. Parental relationships are often complicated and this one was more complicated than most. Uh, you know, you can't distill it down to a single word. Walt. Loved hated, respected, resented, admired. Uh, his dad all at the same time. Uh, his relationship with his mother was much less complicated. Walt's mother's name was flora, and she came from a long line of academics and school teachers. She came from. Uh, sort of upper middle-class American family. She herself was very bright and her boys would describe her as having a wonderful sense of humor. She was loving and affectionate towards her children. And was just an all around great mother. She would even sometimes stick up to Elias for the boys and. Get him to not hit them when he was mad. It was in large part due to the physical and emotional safety that Florida provided that Walt would remember Marcelene as an ideal place to grow up.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/walt-disney", "title": "Walt Disney", "chunk_index": 2, "publication_date": "2022-03-31", "total_chunks_in_doc": 35}}
{"text": "even sometimes stick up to Elias for the boys and . Get him to not hit them when he was mad . It was in large part due to the physical and emotional safety that Florida provided that Walt would remember Marcelene as an ideal place to grow up . Walt Disney: Almost a utopia heaven on earth. In fact, Roy Disney later did say quote, it was just heaven for us city kids. And Walt himself would say everything connected with Mars. Saline was a thrill for us after coming from crowded, smoky Chicago. My favorite quote about Marcellin actually comes from Walt's wife who pointed out that it's kind of strange that it meant so much to him. She said, quote, Marcelene was the most important part of Walt's life. He didn't live there very long. He lived in Chicago and Kansas city much longer, but there was something about that farm that was very important to him. So why was it so important to him? Why was it such a great place to grow up? Well, because the place was well like a Disney movie. Which is not a coincidence. First, there was the nature. There were all sorts of farms, gardens, and groves that provided fruits and vegetables. There were streams and forests. Uh, the place was teaming with little Woodland creatures, like foxes, rabbits, squirrels, possums, and raccoons. Walt loved playing with the farm animals, the pigs, the cows, the chickens. And he would sometimes ride the pigs when driving them into their pen. He also loved fishing for catfish and the Creek in the summer and skating on the little Creek when it froze over in the winter. There was a very strong sense of community in Marcelene both with the neighbors who would help each other men fences. And when it was time to harvest crops, Uh, you know, for, for a week they would all come sleep in the Disney's front yard and the women would stay and cook together. And the men would go out with Elias and the boys and help them harvest their crops. But there was also the sense of community with extended family who were always around aunts, uncles, and cousins. Uh, some of them lived very nearby and even those who didn't live right in Marcelene would often come and visit and in lodge with the Disneys for a week or two. In Marsa lien, you can see all these little hints and echoes of things that would come into waltz art later in life. So for example, as I mentioned, There's sort of the idyllic American countryside with all these little Woodland creatures that would show up. Another thing is his love of trains. As I mentioned, it was a stop on the railroad. And what was fascinated by the train that would come", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/walt-disney", "title": "Walt Disney", "chunk_index": 3, "publication_date": "2022-03-31", "total_chunks_in_doc": 35}}
{"text": "There ' s sort of the idyllic American countryside with all these little Woodland creatures that would show up . Another thing is his love of trains . As I mentioned , it was a stop on the railroad . And what was fascinated by the train that would come Walt Disney: through. Trains to him represented. A chance to travel someplace new and discover the world growing up in a small town, they also represented technology and the future, they represented adventure. They represented opportunity. Uh, you know, eventually just like Thomas Edison, he would take a job on the train selling. Little treats to the passengers and, and making a little pocket money for himself. And by the way, I do find that one of those funny coincidences that they both had that same job as boys selling treats on the train. And you see that show up later and Disneyland and Disney world, and many of his films and movies, his, his love of trains and railroads. Another thing where you can see some echoes is his love of his uncle ed. Uncle ed. Was Walt's uncle obviously. And he would take him on adventures. They would play games, explore the natural world, flag down trains and even catch rides to neighboring towns. Uncle ed was considered by most people to be. Dimwitted and perhaps even mentally handicapped. Um, not so much so that he couldn't watch over Walt. When he was a boy, they would go off just the two of them and go on these adventures. To Walt though. He viewed him as just a kid. That never grew up. Um, because he had this great enthusiasm uncle had this, this love of adventure. And so you can see that echo in Peter pan, uh, Walt viewed him as this Peter pan like figure this. The person who would never grow up and maintain the sense of love of adventure and enjoy and, and, and boyish enthusiasm. Now the Disney farm in Marcelain might have been idyllic, but it was not profitable. The farm was already struggling when Elias came down with either typhoid or diptheria, but he was unable to work. Uh, in 1911. So in 1911, when Walt was nine years old, the Disney family left Marcelene for Kansas city. After moving to Kansas city Elias made a living by purchasing a newspaper delivery route. At this point, Elias's two oldest boys, Herbert and Raymond were already adults and had left home. But Walt and his older brother, Roy were still around and Elias made them work the paper route for him. The paper route would loom heavy and Walt's memory of his boy had years in Kansas city. And you can understand why he would have to wake up at four 30 in the morning, every single morning for six years.

And you can understand why he would have to wake up at four 30 in the morning , every single morning for six years . To go deliver Walt Disney: papers, even in the freezing winter. There are stories that Walt would tell about having to trudge through five foot tall. Snowdrifts in order to deliver some of these papers and, um, Elias was meticulous about that paper route and placed a heavy emphasis on making sure it was done. Right. He would make Walt and his brother, Roy placed the papers inside the storm door of people's houses, even when they had to trudge through feet of fresh fallen snow. So other people were not doing this. Other people were just throwing the paper to the front porch. But the Disney boys had to do it. Right. They had to go place the papers. Exactly. So exactly perfectly on people's stores. At school. Walt was an indifferent student. Not very good. As you can imagine for someone who was waking up at four 30 in the morning as a boy, he often slept through class. Um, but even when he was awake, he was not much of a student. He didn't really care about school. he was always drawing and doodling rather than actually listening or studying when he was at school. The other thing he was doing was performing while discovered a partner in crime in Kansas city at Benton grammar school. Uh, best friend named Walt Pfeiffer, the two who dubbed themselves two bad Walters. We're always creating shows and stunts and jokes. Uh, they had like a little vaudeville show that they did. So Walt had an early streak as a performer. He also had an early interest in entrepreneurship. At one point, he put up a tent and set up his own circus for the neighborhood children charging a dime for admission. But when his mother found out that he was charging these kids, she made him refund everyone, their money. He was always trying to sell newspapers on the side and coming up with little schemes to make a little bit of money. But whenever his father Elias found out about these little side hustles, He would confiscate all of Walt's pocket money. As he was getting older, Walt grew increasingly agitated with his dad's severe ways, harsh discipline. And this was especially true once Roy left. And what was the only boy at home? One day when he was 14 years old, what was helping his father work on the roof of their home? And Walt failed to execute. One of Elias's commands quickly enough, at least in his eyes. And so this resulted in a tirade. Elias yells at wall and says,", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/walt-disney", "title": "Walt Disney", "chunk_index": 5, "publication_date": "2022-03-31", "total_chunks_in_doc": 35}}

And so this resulted in a tirade . Elias yells at wall and says , Walt Disney: go to the basement and I'm gonna come downstairs soon to punish you to hit you. And Roy who happened to be home visiting pulled wall aside on his way to the basement and said, don't take this anymore. You're bigger than him. Don't let him do that to you. And so when Elias came down to the basement, Uh, he grabbed the head of the hammer as usual and raised it to hit Walt with the shaft of his hammer. And while I grabbed his hand. And so then Elias raises his other hand to hit Walt and Walt grabs that hand too. And so he's holding both of his hands and they struggle for a little bit. And that's when Elias realizes, wow. My son is bigger than me. I. I can't do this anymore. I can't hit him anymore. And Elias breaks down. Balling in front of wall. And after that Elias never tried to hit him again. In contrast to Elias Walt, some other flora really shines at this point in Walt's childhood. All of these great people seem to have extraordinary mothers. Edison's mother not only believed in him. But gave him the better part of his education as a boy. Napoleon always considered his father, something of a failure and believe that he got his intelligence and his drive from his mother. I'd like to read a paragraph about flora. From a biography of Walt Disney by a guy named Neil gambler. Very good biography. If you're gonna read one, that's the one I recommend. , Uh, he says about flora quote. It was, she who managed the money for Elias, made most of the children's clothes. And so their quilts cook their meals and encourage their reading connived with the children and always exercise restraint and an even temper. And it was flora alone who could tease her husband and calm his raging storms though. She did so carefully without confronting or countermanding him. Besides his mother, the other pillar of Walt's early life was his brother, Roy, who I've mentioned already. Walt wasn't close with his two oldest brothers who were much older than him, but Roy who was still eight years older than him. I was always his protector and friend. Walt regarded him as something of a surrogate father, since he had such a troubled relationship with his actual father. Interestingly. You know, what was the only dreamer in the family?

You know , what was the only dreamer in the family ? Everyone else was Walt Disney: practical minded and kind of sober. And that included Roy. He didn't have an imagination like wall either, but he respected Walt's creative streak and would help and encourage him all their lives. While also kind of grounding him and bringing some practical sense to the relationship. I had a fascination with cartooning from this very earliest childhood, something that his father did not find practical in Kansas city. The fascination turned into an obsession though. He was simply always drawing. He took Saturday courses at the Kansas city art Institute and also signed up for correspondence courses. And those are like the original online courses. They were distance education courses that came in the mail. Despite this effort, Walt was never an exceptional cartoonist. He wasn't a naturally gifted drawer, but through extensive practice and sheer determination, he did make himself a decent cartoonist. He wasn't bad. In 1917 Elias moved his family back to Chicago where Walt attended high school. He was the cartoonist for the school paper, mostly drawing patriotic cartoons about world war one. He continued to be obsessed with drawing and continued to be a poor student. He even occasionally skipped school to go to the Chicago art Institute or hang around the offices of the Chicago Tribune. They had moved to Chicago because Elias was interested in a business called the Ozil factory. Which produced jellies. The business was doing poorly. So Elias decided to become personally involved while it worked at the factory one summer, though, he did eventually grow tired of it and quit to work as a substitute mail carrier. One side note about that is that, um, we almost never got, uh, Walt Disney because he was almost killed in a terrorist attack. Uh, mail bomb injured 30 and killed four in his post office, including a man who worked just two desks away from Walt. And Walt was very, nearly blown up. He had debris on him. Uh, it's not certain who carried out the attack. They'll most likely it was done by an organized crime gang or perhaps some radical anarchists or radical socialists. For his senior year, Walt decided not to return to high school. He tried forging his birth certificate to join the army, to fight in world war one, but he was caught and rejected. Eventually he was able to forge some papers and joined the red cross to be an ambulance driver. But by the time he got to France with the red cross, the war had already ended.

He spent his time in France doing menial labor and in just Walt Disney: about every spare moment when he was not working, he was doodling and drawing. He even got his work published in the army newspaper. In one of those funny coincidences of history What happened to be stationed in the same ambulance Corps as Ray crock, Ray would end up being the famous CEO of McDonald's who led the fast food chain to become one of the largest companies in the world. And according to one book I read, although I didn't see this repeated anywhere else. So take this with a grain of salt, but apparently Ray remembered that he and the fellows in the Corps thought Walt was a little bit strange because. When they had a, an open opportunity when they had a spare moment, they would go into French towns and try and pick up French girls and what would never come, he would stay behind and just draw and draw and draw. And so they all thought what was kind of funny because. Um, he was drawing all the time while he was in France. And that is, you know, why? I don't know whether that particular story is true, but it is true that Walt was almost compulsive in how much he was drawing at this point in his life. In 1919 wallet returned to the United States. His father had secured a job for him paying $25 a week at the Ozil factory. Which was pretty good rate and Elias was flabbergasted when Walton told him that he was instead holding out for a job as an artist. Walt later said, quote, he never understood me. He thought I was a black sheep, this nonsense of drawing pictures. He said, Walter, you're going to make a career of that. Are you. But while it did eventually get a job as an artist, his brother. Uh, Roy recommended him to acquaintances for an opportunity to apprentice with an illustration advertising company called Admin Rubin commercial art company. While I was just thrilled to gain full-time employment as an artist at the age of only 17, but unfortunately he's laid off a short time later when the art studio went through a financial, rough patch, but it wasn't for poor performance. His associates from those days remembered Walt as a pretty good artist and an extremely hard worker who did things quickly and did them well.

The most important thing to come out of the job for wall is that he made a notable good friend , a very gifted , cartoonist by the name of I works after being laid off up , and Walt decided to start Walt Disney: their own company and they had some initial success, they were selling basic illustrations to Kansas city based companies. And they were a very good partnership. Uh, was an incredibly gifted artist, possessing the kind of artistic talent that Walt could only dream of. But he was shy and socially awkward, whereas wall on the other hand was a decent artist. But charming, extroverted and a natural salesman. So between the two of them, they had exceptional art skills and exceptional sales skills. And so they had some success. But. They were kids, you know, these, they were 17 years old. Um, so when they saw a job ad for a position as a cartoonist with a Kansas city slide company have suggested that Walt should go take the job to provide some steady financial footing for them. And, um, we try to keep the company afloat by himself. Well, as I said, Was not much of a businessman, although he was a great cartoonist, so he wasn't able to hold down the company on his own. And so after not very long, they shuttered the company and up joined wall at the Kansas city slide company. This was their first foray into moving pictures. And Walt was thrilled about it. He would say years later. The trick of making things move on. Film is what got me. Um, another quote from gambler the biographer, he said, quote, Walt Disney, seldom dabbled. Everyone who knew him remarked on his intensity. When something intrigued him, he focused himself entirely as if it were the only thing that mattered. And that thing now that he was focused on was animation. And so he was thrilled. With to be with the slide company, getting an education in animation. Not only was he getting an education from the slide company. But when he couldn't learn there, he was educating himself. Walt set up a studio in his parents' garage. They had recently returned from Chicago after the oil company failed. And so he went to their garage and set up some cameras and some animation equipment and, um, was able to experiment there with different animation techniques. And he was like I said, obsessed. Uh, Roy said, when he'd come home and long after everybody else was in bed, what was out there still puttering away, working away, experimenting, trying this and that drawing and so on.

Um , just figuring out this new technology of animation . You have to remember that . Walt Disney: Animated cartoons. You know, motion, picture cartoons. Are very, very new at this point. This is an industry that isn't even 20 years old. And so it was the wild west. Um, You know, there was no college degree that you could get for animation. You just had to experiment and talk to the people who were doing it and figure it out. At the slide company, they were using a technique, , using cutout cartoons. Which was the standard animation method, but while it starts to become interested in a new technology called cell animation, it used overlapping layers of illustrations on celluloid sheets to quickly create elaborate handicap cartoons. So that. You know, you didn't have to draw the same thing over and over again. You would keep some layers the same for the background or static characters that didn't move while repeatedly redrawing, only those portions of the scene that moved. And overtime while it became not only interested in cell animation, but in his usual way. Obsessed. He was determined that this was the future and he needed to learn how to do it. He's experimenting with it in his garage, talking to more experienced animators, attending classes at the art Institute. And taking out books from the library to read about this new technique. He began using cell technique to produce cartoons, to run in the biggest theater in Kansas city. I called the Newman theater. In a pattern that would be a recurring theme throughout Disney's career.

Is this plant that sort of. Comes to life and just jumps around a little bit. It's actually interesting to me. It's so reminiscent of Pixar when they start, the first thing they do is animate this little lamp. And this little, little plant, this little flower, that wall animates is kind of similar to the Pixar lamp. All have these animations that he's doing. Are very simple. One to two minutes short animations that ran in front of feature length films at movie theaters. They became known as Newman Lafa grams and the company was later named Lafa gram studios by Walt.

He lived for the response of the crowd and people were really responding to his cartoons. They were popular and they made people laugh. Walt soon started dreaming of making longer cartoons, seven minutes, rather than two minute clips that he had been making. And at this point while is really hustling. He's renting a little shack, just up the hill from his day job. Which had changed its name to the Kansas city. Film ad company and they weren't interested in trying or funding Walt's curiosity in cell animation technology. So what was able to work there at the Kansas city film ad company during the day, and then just walk 18 steps up to his own little studio and after hours. Uh, he would try his cell animation stuff and, and they didn't care that he was experimenting with this stuff and taking side projects. He was also able to persuade up and coming animators to come draw for him for free. He didn't have any money to give them so he wasn't paying them, but they could learn cell animation. He was always gifted at getting people to buy in to a larger vision. And that was certainly working in his favor here. So he's got this, this free labor. Eventually Walter. Started to go all in on his new venture, persuaded us to join him once more and built out. And built it out into a full fledged studio. Walt's brothers had recently moved out of Kansas city. And so Walt turned Lafa Graham studios into a sort of surrogate family. Uh, most of them were young and unmarried. They spent long hours working together. The schedule that most of them worked with from 9:00 AM until about midnight. And they were experimenting, playing pranks, working, uh, just having fun. A friend visited and asked while about his new studio. And he asked if they were making good money and Walter responded, frankly. No, but we're having fun. And, uh, that was maybe under selling it. They were having a really great time and Walt was very bad with money. Lafa gram studio soon ended up in financial trouble and, uh, on, on the very urge of bankruptcy. In these dire straits.

He wanted to produce a longer film rather than the one to two minute clips that they had been making . He wanted to try a seven minute Walt Disney: film. That would combine live-action filmography with animation. It was called Alice's Wonderland and was of course inspired by Lewis Carroll's famous novel. It was about a real little girl who enters a magical fantasy world of animation. And this little cartoon actually bears no resemblance to Alice in Wonderland. The famous movie that Disney would later produce. Um, this is a different thing and it only used the Lewis Carroll story as inspiration, but was a different thing. However, the company was falling apart around him. As Walt tried to finish this project of Alice's Wonderland animators were leaving left and right. They were evicted from their offices and even up quit in the end. Um, so the film was finished. Eventually, but only because Walt did the vast majority of the animation himself. Even, so this combination of live action and animation. It was something that people had done before, but this was a little different. Mostly what people had done was mostly live action with a little cartoon. In that live action instead what this was was mostly cartoon. With one live action character. Playing in that cartoon, if that makes sense. So this was very leading edge and very cool. What was more than anything? A forward thinker. He was almost at a Sony inner Steve jobs. He, in, in his love of showing the world something groundbreaking, something new. But he's still working out how to make it profitable or even cost efficient and Alice's Wonderland is not finished in time to save the company, which goes completely belly up. And, you know, I said, well, it was bad with money. Um, but at this point it's not because he's an extravagant spender at the time. He really wants to finish this film. So he's real thin. He's eating nothing but canned beans. He had been evicted from his home was sleeping in a studio. He was showering once a week at the train station. I mean while is really. Just trying to slum it. Just trying to scrape by. In order to finish this animation. His problem was at this point. Not that he was a profligate spender. It was that he wasn't making enough money, Kansas city just wasn't a big enough market to support the cost that went into making an animation of this length and complexity. And, um, at this point he didn't have the connections to get distribution outside of Kansas city.

He had a cheery and optimistic disposition in general and was rarely thrown into a bad mood by setbacks. Walt would later say, quote, I had no recollection of ever being unhappy in my life. I was happy all the time. I was excited. I was doing things. And look, I mean, that's a, that's kind of an exaggeration to be honest. He also said another time that he was crushed and heartbroken at this first bankruptcy, which is understandable for someone who, you know, he's 21 years old. And he just declared bankruptcy. His, his company just failed. But it is true that he did have this, this remarkably buoyant personality things might get him down for a little bit, but after like a day, he tended to pop right back up and be his normal cheery, optimistic self. While it seemed decided that what he needed was a change of scenery. And so he was debating between New York and Los Angeles. And he eventually decided on the ladder mostly because his brother Roy had moved to Los Angeles to recover from tuberculosis. Problem was Walt was so flat broke. Uh, he didn't even have the money for a train ticket out to Los Angeles to start over again. So. He bought a camera on loan and went door to door. To the wealthiest neighborhoods in Kansas city offering to make films of people's children. So this is like kind of the most. Down and dirty side hustle that he could think of and doing this. It was a smarter approach in just a matter of a week or two, he was able to scrape together. Uh, enough money to pay for the camera that he had bought and then buy a train ticket out to LA. When Walt bought that train ticket out of Kansas city. The bitterness of his failures was far from his mind. He said, quote, he felt free and happy as if he were lit up inside by incandescent lights. You know, I think many of us have had that feeling of. Starting over. And have opportunity in front of us. And that's what he was feeling as he took the train to LA. And that's, you know, one of my main takeaways from his life is just that unconquerable optimism. It really was. I mean, it could be illogical at times.

Anyone else would think , you know , You have no reason to be optimistic right now , but it was his super power . Walt Disney: His belief that everything would work out no matter what. Having been recently burned by the animation industry while considered going into the live action film industry. These were the days before Hollywood's golden age. But Los Angeles was quickly becoming a center of film production. And, uh, the center for animation on the other hand was all the way out in New York. So it wasn't necessarily a natural fit to go out to LA in order to start an animation studio. But fate sort of intervened at this point, because while he was in Los Angeles, what was able to come up with a distribution deal for a Alice's Wonderland with a New York based distributor named Margaret Winkler. And with that, Walt teamed up with his brother, Roy to form the Disney brothers cartoon studio, which would go on to become the Walt Disney company. And this was formed in 1923. The company initially started out by completing more episodes of Alice's adventures in Wonderland. Which experienced some popular success. So he hires his old friend up to come work for him as well. And at the time he also hires multiple other ink artists, including an artist named Lillian bounds. Uh, over time while it takes a liking to Lillian and, uh, finds that she likes him back. And they end up getting married in 1925. The marriage was, uh, was a happy one. Uh, Lillian was a very steady and constant companion for Walt and they raised three children together. So you would think that we are set from here, right? Walt has his main team. He has himself, his brother, Roy, his buddy up, who is this savant, brilliant animator. They founded the Walt Disney company and the stuff that they're producing is doing fairly well. They've moved beyond the original Alice's Wonderland films and are producing other original works as well. But it's not quite smooth sailing from there. Uh, trouble would arise when Margaret Winkler, their distributor got married and turned over. Most of her work to her husband, Charles Mintz. And mince and Disney did not get along. They butted heads over a lot of different issues, including the future of the company and what type of animations they should make.

And In fact there was more money coming in and Walt Disney: he and mince were able to come to an agreement over the money. But the real sticking point was that mince kept critiquing Walt's work and making more and more suggestions. Walt thought that he was the true creative genius behind the animations and mince thought that the work was kind of shoddy and that he knew more about how to produce great animations, even though he wasn't himself, an animator. And that might seem ridiculous to us in hindsight, but you know, it is true that mince thought that it was his, his show business savvy. And his notes on Walt's animations that were the keys to their success. They were eventually able to come to a deal. Both in terms of how they would handle their business going forward. You know, who would get more creative freedom. But also in terms of, of money. Um, but this new deal. Did put even more financial stress on wall. who was trying to expand his studio and bringing more animators to make the animations even better. But now, instead of having more money to produce these animations, he would have just a little bit less. He started to push his staff harder and harder. And the air of fun and adventure that had started with the Disney company. Was replaced with stress. Kind of laborious hard work and tension. Due to this tension. Three animators decided to leave and start their own studio. And for a little bit. Things seem shaky, you know? Okay. Animators are leaving. We have a little bit less money. Is this thing even gonna make it, but this all seems to blow over. When Walt comes up with a new series, a completely animated cartoon about a character named Oswald, the lucky rabbit. Oswald was immediately a hit. And other animators regarded him as the gold standard. Other cartoon characters at the time. Tended to just be. Excuses for Galax. You know, they, a lot of them were cartoon animals. But they didn't have a personality. Necessarily that continued from, uh, from cartoon to cartoon. Whereas Oswald did have a real personality that carried from animation to animation and, uh, had different attributes that you could point to. And he was a character that you can kind of get to know.

The staff at Disney studios increases to 22 employees while builds a new home and things are generally going really well for him in his life . But justice things are Walt Disney: finally going great for Walt in 1928, he faces the greatest catastrophe that he's faced yet. Disney went out to New York. To negotiate another new deal with mince with Oswald doing so well. He thought he had great leverage to negotiate more money. Mince saw it completely differently. It was mince who had negotiated the national distribution deal with universal studios. So he was the reason that people were seeing Oswald. , it was mince who actually owned Oswald because of some smart drawing up of contracts. So he owned the intellectual property. It was Disney's animators who were actually drawing Oswald disney himself had stopped being an active animator. A short time previously. So in minces eyes, he's looking at this and saying, okay, I'm doing the distribution. Waltz cartoonists are doing the actual drawing. Well himself as just a middleman, he's a subcontractor. And so mince went around Disney and negotiated employment deals directly with some of Disney's animators. And, um, Disney couldn't believe that, you know, when he hears this, he says no way. And he calls to see if it's true and it's true. They had negotiated contracts with mince himself. Essentially. Cutting Disney out of his own animation. He was mince with stealing Oswald, essentially from Disney is the way that Walt saw it. And so while, you know, he goes out to New York to renegotiate a new deal with Mintz. And to get more money because Oswald, the lucky rabbit is doing so well. And instead what he finds is that there's a trap laid for him. He essentially gets ambushed. And not only does he not get a new deal. But he essentially gets his character and his company and his employees stolen out from under him. And, um, mince is kind of a jerk to him. Just treat some rudely. And, uh, basically treat him like he's a, nobody. And, um, so by the time that Walt took the train back to New York, he was essentially at ground zero. Again, no cartoon character, no deal, no employees. Essentially, no company. And like I said, he had a buoyant personality, but that can only go so far. And the failure really did get to him.

These , these ungrateful animators . and also about minutes and how Walt Disney: he'd betrayed him and ambushed him. But he also let it motivate him. He wasn't just going on tirades. He starts sketching and immediately he he's thinking, okay, I need to come up with a new character to replace Oswald. So that mince can't have the last laugh. I can show that it was actually my creative genius. I might not have been the one who always drew Oswald. But I thought up Oswald and he was my character. So Disney's got nothing. But he does have this sketchpad. And he's sketching out all these new characters, all these ideas for new characters. And he comes up with a story. The story of a little mouse who inspired by Charles Lindbergh builds himself a plane in order to impress a lady mouse. Walt's wife loved the story, but she hated the name. He had named him. Mortimer mouse. Well, while Aster. What do you think about the name? Nikki. I'm going to leave the story off there. Obviously, this is a pivotal turning point in Walt Disney's career. But, um, I'll save that for part two. But for now, let's take a look at a few of the things that made Walt successful. The first was, is unshakable optimism. It's true that Walt could get down and depressed when bad things happened as anyone would. And he could also have a temper, um, not just down in depressed, but he could fire off and he could yell and he could get mad. But in either case he always bounced back extremely quickly and generally kept an extremely optimistic attitude and believe that things would work out. No matter what. This is important because if you've been keeping track, he basically hit rock bottom and had to start over three different times. Uh, he was also extremely charming and a great salesman. Charm is one of those things that is very difficult to define. It's difficult to express how one develops charm. But I found one note on how he was charming. And I found it really interesting. He gave the impression that he took a deep, personal interest. And whoever he was speaking with, people said that when they spoke to Walt, it felt like he turned his entire attention toward them. And, Was really intensely focused on them as a person. And I found it interesting because. Charming people are always described that way. That they lock their entire focus on you when", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/walt-disney", "title": "Walt Disney", "chunk_index": 17, "publication_date": "2022-03-31", "total_chunks_in_doc": 35}}
{"text": "to Walt , it felt like he turned his entire attention toward them . And , Was really intensely focused on them as a person . And I found it interesting because . Charming people are always described that way . That they lock their entire focus on you when Walt Disney: they talk to you. I've heard people describe that same phenomenon. When talking about Steve jobs, Napoleon Donald Trump, bill Clinton, and even Saddam Hussein. It's very mixed company, but every single one of them was a very charming person. And Walt had that same superpower. Of turning his focus on you like a laser. And thereby charming you. Some part of that is an eight. But it seems that while also worked at it, he developed it. , and I know. You know, it's funny, Steve jobs. I had this thing that he would do. That he stared at people and people talk about this. It was like kind of creepy, but always got your attention that Steve jobs would, would stare at you in like, not blink. And Walt had the same habit of locking onto people. And when he was like focused on them, he would stare directly at them. And so, um, again, there's not many too many hacks that you can get out of how to take over the world. Most of these things are sort of general life strategies. But I do think that's one little hack you can take away that you can try. If you are trying to, um, Influence someone charm them, focus on them, try just doing the Steve jobs stare just really intently stare. And it does tend to, at the very least. Break up the normal flow of conversation and get them to really focus on what you're saying and become interested in the conversation and where you're trying to take them. Speaking of focus while had this incredible ability to concentrate all of his energy on one task or one skill at a time. Whether he was learning the basics of cartooning or learning the ins and outs of selling animation. Walt's ability to obsess was one of his greatest strengths. One last thing I wanted to mention. Is, I was talking with someone the other day, someone successful in the world of finance. And this guy mentioned that he was interested in starting his own thing. But I talked to him a second time, a couple of weeks later, and he had decided against it. He didn't want to start his own company. Uh, his thinking was that. He's already comfortable.

And , um , he wants to keep making more good money and there ' s definitely some luck that goes into being really , really successful at the top level and Walt Disney: starting your own venture. And he was talking about some of the other people who'd been successful, starting their own funds. Um, and he basically said that, you know, these people, they put it all on black a few times, so to speak and, um, they happened to get lucky. And they got lucky a few times and they were able to build off of that. And he was afraid that if he didn't have that same luck a few times he could potentially lose a lot of what he had already built. So kind of a classic. Risk reward and this desire to not lose everything that you've built, which I understand. But when I was reading Walt Disney story and hearing about how he bought him out multiple times, It just made me realize that. If you want to reach the top, you have to be comfortable with the fact that not only could you hit rock bottom. But you probably will. At some point, you're probably going to have to go through that before you get to the top. Steve jobs got fired from apple. Napoleon got exiled to Elba. Edison had to watch his entire company literally burned down in front of him. Uh, even Putin. You know, uh, his, his mayor that he was working for soap Jack lost reelection and. And he lost everything. His political career was destroyed. He hit rock bottom. So it's a very common thing. Uh, so keep that in mind. That you can't necessarily count on. Never going through that. But what you have to keep in mind is that it's okay. If you fall flat on your face, if you lose everything, if you've got to start over, you were in the company of the great ones. They all have gone through that. And, um, you can always start over. And at least you're in the arena. You are competing. With the chance to become the greatest. And if you want to play it safe all the time, if you don't want to risk it all, that's fine. A lot of people should make that decision. But you're probably not going to have a chance to be.

The media and imagination until then . Thanks for listening ‚Äç I had Walt Disney: a fascination with cartooning from this very earliest childhood, something that his father did not find practical in Kansas city. The fascination turned into an obsession though. He was simply always drawing. He took Saturday courses at the Kansas city art Institute and also signed up for correspondence courses. And those are like the original online courses. They were distance education courses that came in the mail. Despite this effort, Walt was never an exceptional cartoonist. He wasn't a naturally gifted drawer, but though extensive practice. But through extensive practice and sheer determination, he did make himself a decent cartoonist. He wasn't bad. In 1917. Elias moved the family to. In 1917 Elias moved the family back to Chicago where wall attended high school. In 1917 Elias moved his family back to Chicago where Walt attended high school. He was the cartoonist for the school paper, mostly drawing patriotic cartoons about world war one. He continued to be obsessed with drawing and continued to be a poor student. He even occasionally skipped school to go to the Chicago art Institute or hang around the offices of the Chicago Tribune. They had moved to Chicago because Elias was interested in a business called the Ozil factory. Which produced jellies. The business was doing poorly. So Elias decided to become personally involved while it worked at the factory one summer, though, he did eventually grow tired of it and quit to work as a substitute mail carrier. One side note about that is that, um, we almost never got, uh, Walt Disney because he was almost killed in a terrorist attack. Uh, mail bomb injured 30 and killed four in his post office, including a man who worked just two desks away from Walt. And Walt was very, nearly blown up. He had debris on him. Uh, it's not certain who carried out the attack. They'll most likely it was done by an organized crime gang or perhaps some radical anarchists or radical socialists. For his senior year, Walt decided not to return to high school. He tried forging his birth certificate to join the army, to fight in world war one, but he was caught and rejected. Eventually he was able to forge some papers and joined the red cross to be an ambulance driver. But by the time he got to France with the red cross, the war had already ended. He spent his time in France doing menial labor and in just about every spare moment when he was not working, he was doodling and drawing. He even got his work published in the army newspaper.

In one Walt Disney: of those funny coincidences of history while it happened to be stationed in the same ambulance Corps as Ray Kroc, one book I read said that Ray would end up. Uh, What happened to be stationed in the same ambulance Corps as Ray crock, Ray would end up being the famous CEO of McDonald's who led the fast food chain to become one of the largest companies in the world. And according to one book I read, although I didn't see this repeated anywhere else. So take this with a grain of salt, but apparently Ray remembered that he and the fellows in the Corps thought Walt was a little bit strange because. When they had a, an open opportunity when they had a spare moment, they would go into French towns and try and pick up French girls and what would never come, he would stay behind and just draw and draw and draw. And so they all thought what was kind of funny because. Um, he was drawing all the time while he was in France. And that is, you know, why? I don't know whether that particular story is true, but it is true that Walt was almost compulsive in how much he was drawing at this point in his life. In 1919 wallet returned to the United States. His father had secured a job for him paying $25 a week at the Ozil factory. Which was pretty good rate and Elias was flabbergasted when Walton told him that he was instead holding out for a job as an artist. Walt later said, quote, he never understood me. He thought I was a black sheep, this nonsense of drawing pictures. He said, Walter, you're going to make a career of that. Are you. But while it did eventually get a job as an artist, his brother. Uh, Roy recommended him to acquaintances for an opportunity to apprentice with an illustration advertising company called Admin Rubin commercial art company. While I was just thrilled to gain full-time employment as an artist at the age of only 17, but unfortunately he's laid off a short time later when the art studio went through a financial, rough patch, but it wasn't for poor performance. His associates from those days remembered Walt as a pretty good artist and an extremely hard worker who did things quickly and did them well. The most.

Uh, was the son of German immigrants. And after being laid off oven, Walt decided to start their own company. By the name of UB Iwerks after being laid off up, and Walt decided to start their own company and they had some initial success, they were selling basic illustrations to Kansas city based companies. And they were a very good partnership. Uh, was an incredibly gifted artist, possessing the kind of artistic talent that Walt could only dream of. But he was shy and socially awkward, whereas wall on the other hand was a decent artist. But charming, extroverted and a natural salesman. So between the two of them, they had exceptional art skills and exceptional sales skills. And so they had some success. But. They were kids, you know, these, they were 17 years old. Um, so when they saw a job ad for a position as a cartoonist with a Kansas city slide company have suggested that Walt should go take the job to provide some steady financial footing for them. And, um, we try to keep the company afloat by himself. Well, It was a good idea. Well, as I said, Was not much of a businessman, although he was a great cartoonist, so he wasn't able to hold down the company on his own. And so after not very long, they shuttered the company and up joined wall at the Kansas city slide company. This was their first foray into moving pictures. And Walt was thrilled about it. He would say years later. The trick of making things move on. Film is what got me. Um, another quote from gambler the biographer, he said, quote, Walt Disney, seldom dabbled. Everyone who knew him remarked on his intensity. When something intrigued him, he focused himself entirely as if it were the only thing that mattered. And that thing now that he was focused on was animation. And so he was thrilled. With to be with the slide company, getting an education in animation.

But when he couldn't learn there, he was educating himself. Walt set up a studio in his parents' garage. They had recently returned from Chicago after the oil company failed. And so he went to their garage and set up some cameras and some animation equipment and, um, was able to experiment there with different animation techniques. And he was like I said, obsessed. Uh, Roy said, when he'd come home and long after everybody else was in bed, what was out there still puttering away, working away, experimenting, trying this and that drawing and so on. So he was spending real late nights. Um, just figuring out this new technology of animation. You have to remember that. Animated cartoons. You know, motion, picture cartoons. Are very, very new at this point. This is an industry that isn't even 20 years old. And so it was the wild west. And so it was the wild west. Um, You know, there was no college degree that you could get for animation. You just had to experiment and talk to the people who were doing it and figuring it out. And figure it out. At the slide company, they were using a technique, um, using cutout cartoons. Which was the standard animation method, but while it starts to become interested in a new technology called cell animation, it used overlapping layers of illustrations on celluloid sheets to quickly create elaborate handicap cartoons. So that. You know, you didn't have to draw the same thing over and over again. You would keep some layers. You would keep some layers the same for the background or static characters that didn't move while repeatedly redrawing, only those portions of the scene that moved. And overtime while it became not only interested in cell animation, but in his usual way. Obsessed. He was determined that this was the future and he needed to learn how to do it. He's experimenting with it in his garage, talking to more experienced animators, attending classes at the art Institute. And taking out books from the library to read about the new technique.

And did they also, uh, tended to give life to inanimate objects? So one of his first, um, Cartoons that he does on his very own. Is this plant that sort of. Comes to life and just jumps around a little bit. It's actually interesting to me. It's so reminiscent of Pixar when they start, the first thing they do is animate this little lamp. And this little, little plant, this little flower, that wall animates is kind of similar to the Pixar lamp. They all have these animations that he's doing. Are very simple. One to two minutes short animations that ran in front of feature length films at movie theaters. They became known as Newman Lafa grams and the company was later named Lafa gram studios by Walt. The cartoons were a commercial failure. Um, but they were creative success. They made wall a mini celebrity in Kansas city, and he soon discovered that he loved the attention. He loved, you know, he was a natural showman. He was a. He's a natural performer. He lived for the response of the crowd and people were really responding to his cartoons. They were popular and they made people laugh. Walt soon started dreaming of making longer cartoons, seven minutes, rather than two minute clips that he had been making. And at this point while is really hustling. He's renting a little shack, just up the hill from his day job. Which had changed its name to the Kansas city. Film ad company and they weren't interested in trying or funding Walt's curiosity in cell animation technology. So what was able to work there at the Kansas city film ad company during the day, and then just walk 18 steps up to his own little studio and after hours. Uh, he would try his cell animation stuff and, and they didn't care that he was experimenting with this stuff and taking side projects. He was also able to persuade up and coming animators to come draw for him for free. They wouldn't make any money. He didn't have any money to give them so he wasn't paying them, but they could learn cell animation. He was always gifted at getting people to buy in to a larger vision.

And Walter responded, frankly. No, but we're having fun. And, uh, that was maybe under selling it. They were having a really great time and Walt was very bad with money. Lafa gram studio soon ended up in financial trouble and, uh, on, on the very urge of bankruptcy. In these dire straits. Disney tried throwing a hail Mary. He wanted to produce a longer film rather than the one to two minute clips that they had been making. He wanted to try a seven minute film. That would combine live-action filmography with animation. It was called Alice's Wonderland and was of course inspired by Lewis Carroll's famous novel. It was about a real little girl who enters a magical fantasy world of animation. And it's important to note that this short cartoon bears. No resemblance to Alison Wonderland. And this little cartoon actually bears no resemblance to Alice in Wonderland. The famous movie that Disney would later produce. Um, this is a different thing and it only used the Lewis Carroll story as inspiration, but was a different thing. However, the company was falling apart around him. As Walt tried to finish this project of Alice's Wonderland animators were leaving left and right. They were evicted from their offices and even up quit in the end. Um, so the film was finished. Eventually, but only because Walt did the vast majority of the animation himself.

Mostly what people had done was mostly live action with a little cartoon. In that live action instead what this was was mostly cartoon. With one live action character.

Um, but at this point it's not because he's an extravagant spender at the time. He really wants to finish this film. So he's real thin. He's eating nothing but canned beans. He had been evicted from his home was sleeping in a studio. He was showering once a week at the train station. I mean while is really. Just trying to slum it. Just trying to scrape by. In order to finish this animation. His problem was at this point. Not that he was a prolific. Profligate spender. It was that he wasn't making enough money, Kansas city just wasn't a big enough market to support the cost that went into making an animation of this length and complexity. And, um, at this point he didn't have the connections to get distribution outside of Kansas city. Despite this company failing Walt is in pretty good spirits. He had a cheery and optimistic disposition in general and was rarely thrown into a bad mood by setbacks. Walt would later say, quote, I had no recollection of ever being unhappy in my life. I was happy all the time. I was excited. I was doing things. And look, I mean, that's a, that's kind of an exaggeration to be honest. He also said another time that he was crushed and heartbroken at this first bankruptcy, which is understandable for someone who, you know, he's 21 years old. And he just declared bankruptcy.

While it seemed decided that what he needed was a change of scenery. And so he was debating between New York and Los Angeles. And he eventually decided on the ladder mostly because his brother Roy had moved to Los Angeles to recover from tuberculosis. Problem was Walt was so flat broke. Uh, he didn't even have the money for a train ticket out to Los Angeles to start over again. So. He bought a camera on loan and went door to door. To the wealthiest neighborhoods in Kansas city offering to make films of people's children. So this is like kind of the most. Down and dirty side hustle that he could think of and doing this. It was a smarter approach in just a matter of a week or two, he was able to scrape together. Uh, enough money to pay for the camera that he had bought and then buy a train ticket out to LA.

Walt Disney: What was able to come up with a distribution deal for a Alice's Wonderland with a New York based distributor named Margaret Winkler. And with that, Walt teamed up with his brother, Roy to form the Disney brothers cartoon studio, which would go on to become the Walt Disney company. And this was formed in 1923. The company initially started out by completing more episodes of Alice's adventures in Wonderland. Which experienced some popular success. So he hires his old friend up to come work for him as well. And at the time he also hires multiple other ink artists, including an artist named Lillian bounds. Um, Walt. Likes the. Uh, over time while it takes a liking to Lillian and, uh, finds that she likes him back. And they end up getting married in 1925. The marriage was, uh, was a happy one. Uh, Lillian was a very steady and constant companion for Walt and they raised three children together. So you would think that we are set from here, right? Walt has his main team. He has himself, his brother, Roy, his buddy up, who is this savant, brilliant animator. They founded the Walt Disney company and the stuff that they're producing is doing fairly well. They've moved beyond the original Alice's Wonderland films and are producing other original works as well. But it's not quite smooth sailing from there. Uh, trouble would arise when Margaret Winkler, their distributor got married and turned over. Most of her work to her husband, Charles Mintz. And mince and Disney did not get along. They butted heads over a lot of different issues, including the future of the company and what type of animations they should make. And most of all over money and how much Walt and his company were entitled to. At a time when Walt short animations we're doing better than ever. Walt wanted to get paid more and get paid faster. In fact, there was more money coming in. And he immense we're able to. And in fact there was more money coming in and he and mince were able to come to an agreement over the money. But the real sticking point was that mince kept critiquing Waltz's work. I kept critiquing Walt's work and making more and more suggestions.

And his notes on Walt's animations that were the keys to their success. They were eventually able to come to a deal. Both in terms of how they would handle their business going forward. Um, You know, who would get more creative freedom. But also in terms of, of money. Um, but this new deal. Did put even more financial stress on wall. Um, who was trying to expand his studio and bringing more animators to make the animations even better. But now, instead of having more money to produce these animations, he would have just a little bit less. He started to push his staff harder and harder. And the air of fun and adventure that had started with the Disney company. Was replaced with stress. Kind of laborious hard work and tension. Due to this tension. Three animators decided to leave and start their own studio. And for a little bit. Things seem shaky, you know? Okay. Animators are leaving. We have a little bit less money. Is this thing even gonna make it, but this all seems to blow over. When Walt comes up with a new series, a completely animated cartoon about a character named Oswald, the lucky rabbit. Oswald was immediately a hit. And other animators regarded him as the gold standard. Other cartoon characters at the time. Tended to just be. Excuses for Galax. You know, they, a lot of them were cartoon animals. But they were just, um, you know, But they didn't have a personality. Necessarily that continued from, uh, from cartoon to cartoon.

So he was the reason that people were seeing Oswald. Um, he was the one who was distributing them at the time. It was. Cut that. It was mince who actually owned Oswald because of some smart drawing up of contracts. So he owned the intellectual property. It was Disney's animators who were actually drawing Oswald Disney himself had stopped being an active animator. A little bit of a short time previously. Disney himself had stopped being an active animator. A short time previously. So in minces eyes, he's looking at this and saying, okay, I'm doing the distribution. Waltz cartoonists are doing the actual drawing. Walt Disney himself is just a middleman. He's a subcon. Well himself as just a middleman, he's a subcontractor. And so mince had. And so mince went around Disney and negotiated employment deals directly with some of Disney's animators. And, um, Disney couldn't believe that, you know, when he hears this, he says no way. And he calls to see if it's true and it's true. They had negotiated contracts with mince himself. Essentially. Cutting Disney out of his own animation. He was mince with stealing Oswald, essentially from Disney is the way that Walt saw it. And so while, you know, he goes out to New York to renegotiate a new deal with Mintz. And to get more money because Oswald, the lucky rabbit is doing so well. And instead what he finds is that there's a trap laid for him. He essentially gets ambushed.

Um, and also about minutes and how he'd betrayed him and ambushed him. But he also let it motivate him. He wasn't just going on tirades. He starts sketching and immediately he he's thinking, okay, I need to come up with a new character to replace Oswald. So that mince can't have the last laugh. I can show that it was actually my creative genius. I might not have been the one who always drew Oswald. But I thought up Oswald and he was my character. So Disney's got nothing. But he does have this sketchpad. And he's sketching out all these new characters, all these ideas for new characters. And he comes up with a story. The story of a little mouse who inspired by Charles Lindbergh builds himself a plane in order to impress a lady mouse. Walt's wife loved the story, but she hated the name. He had named him. Mortimer mouse. Well, while Aster. What do you think about the name? Nikki. Um, I'm going to leave the story off there. Obviously, this is a pivotal turning point in Walt Disney's career.

It's true that Walt could get down and depressed when thing. The first was, is unshakable optimism. It's true that Walt could get down and depressed when bad things happened as anyone would. In fact he could get. And he could also have a temper, um, not just down in depressed, but he could fire off and he could yell and he could get mad. But in either case he always bounced back extremely quickly and generally kept an extremely optimistic attitude and believe that things would work out. No matter what. This is important because if you've been keeping track, he basically hit rock bottom and had to start over three different times. Uh, he was also extremely charming and a great salesman. Charm is one of those things that is very difficult to define. It's difficult to express how one develops charm. But I found one note on how he was charming. And I found it really interesting.

And whoever he was speaking with , people said that when they Walt Disney: spoke to Walt, it felt like he turned his entire attention toward them. And, um, Was really intensely focused on them as a person. And I found it interesting because. Charming people are always described that way. That they lock their entire focus on you when they talk to you. I've heard people describe that same phenomenon. When talking about Steve jobs, Napoleon Donald Trump, bill Clinton, and even Saddam Hussein. It's very mixed company, but every single one of them was a very charming person. And Walt had that same superpower. Of turning his focus on you with. Of turning his focus on you like a laser. And thereby charming you. Some part of that, isn't innate. Some part of that is an eight. But it seems that while also worked at it, he developed it. Um, and I know. You know, it's funny, Steve jobs. I had this thing that he would do. That he stared at people and people talk about this. It was like kind of creepy, but always got your attention that Steve jobs would, would stare at you in like, not blink. And Walt had the same habit of locking onto people. And when he was like focused on them, he would stare directly at them. And so, um, again, there's not many too many hacks that you can get out of how to take over the world. Most of these things are sort of general life strategies. But I do think that's one little hack you can take away that you can try. If you are trying to, um, Influence someone charm them, focus on them, try just doing the Steve jobs stare just really intently stare. And it does tend to, at the very least. Break up the normal flow of conversation and get them to really focus on what you're saying and become interested in. What it is that you want them to. And become interested in the conversation and where you're trying to take them. Uh, speaking of focus, we'll have this incredible. Oh, gosh. Speaking of focus while had this incredible ability to concentrate all of his energy on one task or one skill at a time.

But I talked to him a second time, a couple of weeks later, and he had decided against it. He didn't want to start his own company. Uh, his thinking was that. He's already comfortable. He's made good money. And, um, he wants to keep making more good money and there's definitely some luck that goes into being really, really successful at the top level and starting your own venture. And, um, you know, he's talking about some of the other people who've been really successful starting their own ventures, starting.

He enters the cave, and the reward for following that curiosity is that he discovers in the walls of the cave a fossilized skeleton of a whale. The historian Kenneth Clark called Da Vinci the most relentlessly curious man in history. And I have to agree. When you read enough of these biographies, you start to see certain archetypes, certain types of people. But I think Da Vinci is a one of one. I‚Äôve never seen or read about a mind like his ever anywhere. You are probably not wired like Da Vinci. That‚Äôs okay, I‚Äôm not, most people aren‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not sure anyone is.. But I think anyone can learn how to be more curious by learning about his story. And curiosity, as it turns out, is a superpower. Da Vinci is widely regarded as one of the greatest artists of all time, if not THE greatest artist of all time. He painted what are probably the two most famous paintings of all time in the Mona Lisa and the Last Supper. His sketch of the Vitruvian man could also probably go on the list of most famous artworks. He was also a shockingly insightful amateur scientist. When reading through the excellent biography of Da Vinci by Walter Isaacson, I was struck by how often you read the phrase ‚Äúwhich wouldn‚Äôt be replicated for another 100 years‚Äù or 200 years, or even sometimes 300 years.

Da Vinci did, and he did it like no one before or since. This is an episode about how to actually do it, how to combine art and science to become a great innovator. So let‚Äôs get into it. This is part one on the life of Leonardo Da Vinci. Welcome to How to Take Over the World. *** Dance Break *** Leonardo Da Vinci was a bastard. His father was a minor nobleman from Vinci, a small town outside of Florence, and his mother was a 15-year orphan. Luckily for him, renaissance Italy has been described as a golden age for bastards. In Florence especially, the culture was quite accepting of weirdness generally, and bastards in particular. In fact I would say that it was weirdly accepting of the practice. At the time of Leonardo‚Äôs birth, his father, Pierro, was engaged to be married to a woman from a very prominent Florentine family. And yet when Leonardo was baptized at one day old, the whole Da Vinci family showed up for the baptism, and made a proper party out of it - apparently feeling no guilt or embarrassment. If nothing else, you would think they would sweep it under the rug for the sake of the poor Florentine girl who Pierro was scheduled to marry in a matter of weeks, but no, they were quite proud of this illegitimate child. In fact not only was illegitimacy not a problem for Leonardo, I think you can make the case that it helped him. As I said, Leonardo was very curious, even as a boy. He was extremely bright and his talent as an artist was apparent from a very young age. But today we might call him ADD. He had a lot of trouble focusing, completing tasks, and focusing on anything that did not capture his interest. If he had been a legitimate child of Pierro, he would have been expected to take up his father‚Äôs trade as a notary. And for my American listeners, renaissance notaries were not like American notaries today, they were essentially lawyers, it was a prestigious occupation that could make you quite wealthy.

{"text": "trade as a notary . And for my American listeners , renaissance notaries were not like American notaries today , they were essentially lawyers , it was a prestigious occupation that could make you quite wealthy . But Leonardo would not have been a good notary , because of his Leonardo Da Vinci (Part 1): distractibility. He also would have received a classical education from a young age. Instead, he was allowed to have a carefree childhood exploring the Tuscan countryside, letting his imagination run wild, and learning by experimentation and observation. The only formal schooling he received was a couple of years in an abacus school, designed to teach young Florentine‚Äôs the rudimentary math required to engage in commerce. He also received some informal education. He was of course taught how to read and write and was given a rudimentary education at home. At twelve years old, he moves from the small town of Vinci to Florence with his father. He later wrote in his journal how much he missed the countryside, the animals and plants that he had come to love, but at the same time he was thrilled by the intellectual scene in Florence. This is peak renaissance in Florence. It‚Äôs an explosion of knowledge, culture, and art. There are a lot of reasons for this. One of the biggest ones is the printing press, which was invented the year Leonardo was born. Information could be disseminated at a fraction of the cost that it had cost to copy books by hand. Another reason for the renaissance was the fall of Constantinople. Constantinople had been one of the great centers of Christian learning. It was a cosmopolitan city where people from Europe, Asia, and Africa came together to trade and to learn. For more than a thousand years it had been one of the great cities of the world. Well when Muslims conquered it in 1453, many Christian scholars decided that they might be better off under Christian rule in Western Europe, so they abandoned the city and came to places like Florence, bringing their knowledge with them - as well as a vast trove of books and manuscripts. The fall of Constantinople and the invention of the printing press were like two waves in the ocean that crest on top of each other, creating a tidal wave. So the combination of new information with a new way to spread it is a big part of what created the renaissance - which is a complete revolution in everything: you‚Äôve got innovations in science and engineering, in medicine, in art, in commerce, in technology, and more. And Florence is the epicenter of all of this. It was the richest city in Europe and one of the great centers of industry and commerce. Its merchants were rich, and they loved to show off their wealth by patronizing the arts. When Leonardo first came to Florence, he would have heard the whirring and clacking of weavers shops, the hammers and furnaces", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/leonardo-da-vinci", "title": "Leonardo Da Vinci (Part 1)", "chunk_index": 2, "publication_date": "2023-04-19", "total_chunks_in_doc": 12}}
{"text": "of the great centers of industry and commerce . Its merchants were rich , and they loved to show off their wealth by patronizing the arts . When Leonardo first came to Florence , he would have heard the whirring and clacking of weavers shops , the hammers and furnaces Leonardo Da Vinci (Part 1): of goldsmith shops, the bustle of wagons and carts carrying goods, the music of street performers, the shouts and hurried conversations of merchants like the Medicis trading in the markets. It was the New York City of its time. It was the place where everything was happening commercially and artistically. Now at first, Leonardo was just living with his father, presumably helping him out with odd jobs and tasks related to the notary business. But his father writes of him at this time that he ‚Äúnever ceased drawing and sculpting.‚Äù So he has this obsession. And so his father shows some of his drawings to a notable local artist named Andrea del Verrocchio. Verrocchio is very impressed by what he sees and takes the boy on as an apprentice at age 17. His apprenticeship is interesting because it defies many of the stereotypes that we have about great artists. First of all, the environment is not self-serious and ponderous. It‚Äôs more like a commercial shop than a fine art studio. There is a workroom on the ground floor, open to the street, where they are mass-producing products from easels, kilns, pottery wheels, and metal grinders. These aren‚Äôt artistes, it‚Äôs a bunch of lads who are joking around and having a good time - making money, and also exploring their craft together, one-upping each other, competing, and collaborating on how to create better and better art. It‚Äôs an environment that reminds me a lot of silicon valley in the 70s, or Thomas Edison and his It reminds me of silicon valley in the 70s, or of Edison and the traveling telegraph operators of the latter half of the 19th century. Leonardo found it to be an ideal environment. He later wrote ‚Äúdrawing in company is much better than alone.‚Äù And I think that is true of many pursuits. Perhaps, in the age of remote work, too many of us are doing creative work alone. Maybe it‚Äôs not just drawing that is better done in company. Maybe writing, and composing, and graphic design are much better in company than alone. Now despite the mundane nature of some of his early work, it‚Äôs not long before Verrochio notices how gifted Leonardo is. It‚Äôs during this time that he begins pioneering two new approaches. The first is called chiaroscuro, which means light and dark. Essentially, this is the practice of adding black pigments to create shadows. And this allowed Leonardo to much more realistically depict the effect of light and shading on a subject. The other innovation was something called", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/leonardo-da-vinci", "title": "Leonardo Da Vinci (Part 1)", "chunk_index": 3, "publication_date": "2023-04-19", "total_chunks_in_doc": 12}}
{"text": "first is called chiaroscuro , which means light and dark . Essentially , this is the practice of adding black pigments to create shadows . And this allowed Leonardo to much more realistically depict the effect of light and shading on a subject . The other innovation was something called Leonardo Da Vinci (Part 1): sfumato, which means smoke. Leonardo, with his keen power of observation, noticed that in real life, we hardly ever see actual hard lines, but soft lines and shaded contours. He wrote ‚Äúyour shadows and lights should be blended without lines or borders in the manner of smoke losing itself in the air.‚Äù The best way to understand this is to Google The Baptism of Christ Da Vinci. This is a painting done by Verocchio and Da Vinci together. On the right side you can see John the Baptist, whose body was painted by Verocchio. Look at the leg, it‚Äôs painted accurately with lots of details, but you‚Äôll see how it‚Äôs painted with hard lines. Now look at the body of Jesus on the left, which was painted by Da Vinci. Look at the leg, with his use of Sfumato, he has rendered it much more realistically. The leg does not have hard lines, but subtle shading differentiates the various muscles in the leg. The technique in this painting was so ahead of its time, that supposedly after The Baptism of Christ, Verocchio vowed never to paint again. And he never did another painting commission on his own. Think about that, Verrocchio was a famous painter in his own right with many notable pupils. And he‚Äôs only 40, he‚Äôs not old. The pupil had so thoroughly outpaced the master that Verrochio could only marvel. He thought that once he had seen a master like Da Vinci, the right thing was to leave the painting to a genius like him. Now why was Leonardo so focused on these new techniques? He wrote that ‚ÄúThe first intention of the painter was to make a flat surface display a body as if modeled and separated from this plane.‚Äù In other words, it was to render objects realistically, to make them appear three dimensional on a two dimensional plane. In that way, Da Vinci was very much the Pixar of his time. Remember, Pixar started out as a technology company focused on the technical problem of rendering 3D images and only later became an animation studio. Both Da Vinci and Pixar were consumed with how to render three dimensional objects on a two dimensional surface, the only difference was that Pixar‚Äôs objects moved. And like Pixar, Da Vinci wasn‚Äôt just pioneering these technical innovations for their own sake, but because they allowed him to communicate more effectively through his art. He could better display movement and emotion and story by painting more realistically. It‚Äôs an interesting paradox that those who are focused on the technical details of", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/leonardo-da-vinci", "title": "Leonardo Da Vinci (Part 1)", "chunk_index": 4, "publication_date": "2023-04-19", "total_chunks_in_doc": 12}}
{"text": "technical innovations for their own sake , but because they allowed him to communicate more effectively through his art . He could better display movement and emotion and story by painting more realistically . It ‚Äô s an interesting paradox that those who are focused on the technical details of Leonardo Da Vinci (Part 1): their craft are often those who create the most transcendent art. There is a famous quote from Pablo Picasso ‚ÄúWhen art critics get together they talk about Form and Structure and Meaning. When artists get together they talk about where you can buy cheap turpentine.‚Äù And for whatever reason, the people who talk about where to buy cheap turpentine create better form and structure and meaning than the people who talk about form and structure and meaning. Now, in order to meet this technical challenge, Da Vinci not only pioneered new techniques, he also pioneered new materials. Instead of using traditional egg-based paints, he used many many layers of very transparent oil-based paints. And this also helped create a feeling of depth and three-dimensionality. He also carefully studied perspective and optics. He observed how objects looked different at different distances, with different backgrounds, from different heights and angles. Now we should also talk about Leonardo‚Äôs personal life at this time. Everything about Leonardo was weird. He was a bastard. He was left-handed. He was a vegetarian because he was a great lover of animals and didn‚Äôt want them harmed. He dressed differently. He wore a rose colored tunic that came to the knees, where most people wore long tunics that went to the ground. And his sexuality was different. In 1476 at age 24, he was accused of engaging in sodomy with a male prostitute, along with three other young men. The charges were dismissed because one of the accused was related to the Medicis, but this certainly does not prove that the incident never happened. Florence at the time was much more tolerant of homosexuality than most other times and places in Europe‚Äôs history, but that had its limits. And the accusation seemed to have left an impression on Leonardo, who went into a little bit of a funk. Around that time, he wrote in one of his notebooks ‚ÄúIf there is no love, what then?‚Äù Of course, we can‚Äôt be sure of Leonardo‚Äôs sexuality, and applying terms like gay to the past can be anachronistic. But there are reasons to believe that he preferred male companionship. He never pursued a physical or romantic relationship with a woman. Throughout his career, he had a habit of painting androgynous figures, and while he was obviously interested in the male figure and drew many male nudes, he did not have a corresponding interest in the female figure. In the one nude of a woman that he sketched, the genitalia looks dark and scary, and is anatomically incorrect.

In the one nude of a woman that he sketched , the genitalia looks dark and scary , and is anatomically incorrect . So Leonardo Da Vinci (Part 1): I‚Äôm not trying to play Sigmund Freud here but it does seem likely that he at least had some homosexual proclivities. These anonymous accusations may have contributed to Da Vinci‚Äôs decision to eventually leave Florence in 1482. Although there was another, even bigger reason. He had left Verrochio‚Äôs workshop to try to start his own, as would be expected from someone with his talent. But he was so unfocused and such a perfectionist that he could rarely ever actually finish a commission. Soon, he‚Äôs got would-be clients hounding him to finish their paintings. Da Vinci of course wanted to finish the commissions and frankly needed the money, but he hated working on anything that didn‚Äôt fascinate him. And what fascinated him was learning. Generally, he had really high energy when a commission was started and he was figuring out the concept of the painting and the hurdles that needed to be tackled in order to make it happen. But once solid progress was made, and he was sure he had figured out the problem, he would lose interest. He also hated finishing works because he hated imperfection. This inability to finish works and the subsequent pressure from his clients sent him into a pretty severe depression. He wrote in his notebook at the time ‚ÄúTell me if anything was ever done. Tell me. Tell me. While I thought that I was learning how to live, I have been learning how to die.‚Äù Well in 1482, Da VInci turned 30, and decided to leave Florence. He was already an innovator and a recognized genius, but a remarkably unaccomplished one. All he had to show for his effort were some contributions to paintings he did jointly with Verrochio, a couple of unfinished would-be masterpieces, and one undelivered portrait of a young woman. Luckily, he would soon have the chance to start over. He was actually sent from Florence to Milan as a diplomatic gift to the Duke of Milan. Florence had commissioned a new type of lyre, which is a stringed musical instrument, and they sent Leonardo, who was a very gifted musician, to deliver the gift and play it for the duke. The trip was 180 miles long, which Da Vinci knew because he developed a wooden odometer that made a mark with every wheel turn in order to track the length of the journey. When he gets there, after he delivers the lyre, he writes to the duke of Milan to offer his services.

He ‚Äô s a little burned out on being a painter , so he really pitches himself as an inventor and military engineer . He Leonardo Da Vinci (Part 1): says that he can design bridges, fortifications, siege weapons, canals, waterworks, public buildings, and more. In his letter to the Duke of Milan, he throws in at the end, oh yeah, I can also paint. He puts it at the very end ‚Äúlikewise in painting I can do everything possible as well as any other man, whosoever he may be.‚Äù Literally, by the way, I‚Äôm also the best painter in the world. Luckily he is hired by the Duke of Milan. He never does make much use of his supposed skills in military engineering, but he produces pageants and theatrical performances, plays the lyre, writes, and paints a little for the court. Break Pageants were a better medium for Leonardo than painting, because they had performance deadlines and therefore he was able to finish things. He was apparently quite exceptional as a producer, it‚Äôs a shame that these productions are essentially lost to time. He had no way of preserving his plays as he did his paintings. But he put the same level of detail and interest into them. In one play, there was a bird that flew through the scene. Now in a normal play, you maybe get a little fake bird, and fly it through the scene on a string. But Da Vinci spent countless hours studying birds and their wings to find out exactly how they moved and at what speed and created an extremely realistic mechanical bird that flapped its wings. But even pageants weren‚Äôt enough for Leonardo. One of the reasons for being in Milan is that it was a larger city than Florence, and had a more diverse set of intellectual pursuits. Whereas Florence was the center for commerce and art, Milan also had more experts in fields like science, literature, medicine, and military engineering. Leonardo had always been a doodler and a note taker, but it is in Milan that he starts keeping his famous notebooks. The notebooks of Leonardo are incredible. He actually didn‚Äôt publish any of his scientific discoveries and observations in his lifetime, so it‚Äôs only through these notebooks that we get a glimpse of Leonardo‚Äôs true genius. We see him propose an armored, human powered tank, flying machines, a telescope, siege weapons, waterworks, a machine-gun-like rotating cannon, a helicopter, scuba-like diving equipment, and much more. We also see quirky observations from everyday life - such as the fact that a dragonfly's back wings go down as his front wings go up - and profound scientific discoveries - his realization that", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/leonardo-da-vinci", "title": "Leonardo Da Vinci (Part 1)", "chunk_index": 7, "publication_date": "2023-04-19", "total_chunks_in_doc": 12}}
{"text": "a helicopter , scuba - like diving equipment , and much more . We also see quirky observations from everyday life - such as the fact that a dragonfly ' s back wings go down as his front wings go up - and profound scientific discoveries - his realization that Leonardo Da Vinci (Part 1): blood swirls and eddies in the heart wouldn‚Äôt be confirmed until the 21st century. Leonardo dissected bodies and used the findings from these dissections to make the most accurate diagrams of the human body ever created to that point. It would take hundreds of years before they were again matched. What comes through in these notebooks is his curiosity and the probing nature of his brain. On one page you‚Äôll have a ground-breaking diagram of the heart, and a doodle of a tree, and a shopping list. You‚Äôll have the design for a new musical instrument and a riddle and a journal entry. With the financial security that came from getting a regular salary from the duke of Milan, Leonardo had the freedom to let his curiosity truly run wild. Now, all of this has to be caveated with the fact that he really only had one or two inventions that ever actually made it out of his brain and into the real world. And that‚Äôs still impressive. I mean, if in your obituary it said that you were the greatest artist of your generation AND you invented the wheel lock which was an important innovation in the science of warfare, I think you would consider that a very successful life. But when you read through his journals, it becomes clear that he had so much more to contribute than he actually did. The reason that he didn‚Äôt contribute more inventions and scientific discoveries was he didn‚Äôt have to. He loved learning for learning‚Äôs sake. In the field of art, commissions forced him to sometimes complete his work. Even then he often didn‚Äôt. But the fact that people were paying him and expected him to produce something forced him to take his innovations from the pages of his journals into real life. But in the fields of science and engineering he had no such constraints and so he never actually finished things. *** Break *** The two great masterpieces that Da Vinci did finish during his first stint in Milan was the Vitruvian man and the Last Supper. Now the Vitruvian man as not supposed to be a work of art. It was born from conversations he was having with his friends. Leonardo had lots of friends. He was handsome, well-built and proportioned, generous, funny, and open. One friend he made was an architect and polymath from Siena named Francesco de Giorgio.

{"text": "an architect and polymath from Siena named Francesco de Giorgio . Giorgio and Da Vinci traveled together to meet a scholar named Poggio Bracciolini who had recently translated the works of a Roman statesman and architect who lived in the first century BC named Vitruvian . Vitruvian mostly wrote on Leonardo Da Vinci (Part 1): architecture, but he had a long passage about human proportions and their relation to one another. It demonstrated that ideal, aesthetically pleasing bodies were defined by certain set proportions. After meeting with Bracciolini, this translator, and reading his translation of Vitruvius, Giorgio and Leonardo, along with another one of their friends named Giacomo Andrea, set about trying to diagram the proportions laid out by Vitruvius. Okay I just introduced a lot of names so I‚Äôll go through that again. Vitruvius is the ancient Roman who originally tried to figure out the ideal proportions of a human body. Bracciolini is the one who rediscovered his work 1500 years later and translated from Latin into Italian. And Girorgio and Andrea are Leonardo's friends who are researching this stuff with him. Giorgio and Andrea made their own attempts at diagramming the proportions set out by Vitruvius, and while they are impressive, more than anything, they serve to highlight the brilliance of Leonardo‚Äôs Vitruvian man. For one thing, it is more scientifically correct than the others. The body looks more natural, the proportions more correct. It is also rendered more beautifully. The man is fully sketched out with proper shading. The result is beautiful. Walter Isaacon describes Vitruvian man as ‚Äúthe ultimate symbol of the intersection of art and science.‚Äù It has become a symbol of that, and also of the renaissance, of the beauty of the human body, of the reasoning capacity of man, and so much more. And I think it demonstrates the genius of Leonardo more than anything else. It was not designed to be a work of art. It was a sketch in a personal notebook, created for no other reason than to satisfy his personal curiosity. Can you imagine that? How amazing or an artist would you have to be for a glorified sketchbook doodle to become one of the great artistic works of all time? His other masterpiece from this time was The Last Supper. He was also doing it on purpose. It is in his time in Milan that he paints what is probably the second greatest painting of all time, the Last Supper. The Last Supper was a masterpiece in every sense of the word. For years he had studied perspective and geometry in order to properly be able to paint scenes with depth, and The Last Supper was a masterpiece in creating the perception of depth. He was also able to use sfumato and chiaroscuro to create the sensations of movement and emotion. The painting depicts the moment when Jesus has just told his apostles that one of them will betray him.

{"text": "perception of depth . He was also able to use sfumato and chiaroscuro to create the sensations of movement and emotion . The painting depicts the moment when Jesus has just told his apostles that one of them will betray him . His apostles appear to be in motion , Leonardo Da Vinci (Part 1): talking, sulking, and gesturing their feelings. Now I love the story of how he actually painted. So a contemporary wrote that he would ‚ÄúCome here in the early hours of the morning and mount the scaffolding and then remain there brush in hand from sunrise to sunset forgetting to eat or drink, painting continually.‚Äù And then he goes on to say that on other days he would show up, stare at the painting for a while, and then leave without touching his brush. It reminds me of the chapter in The Almanack of Naval Ravikant where Naval talks about working like a lion and not like a cow. Cows are walking around chewing grass all day. They are always kind of working. But lions rest and recharge, and then they spring and take down a gazelle and eat it. And he says that it‚Äôs better to work like a lion. And that‚Äôs what Leonardo does, he works like a lion, sometimes he works furiously, and then other times he doesn't work at all. ‚ÄúMen of lofty genius sometimes accomplish the most when they work the least,‚Äù Let me repeat that. He goes on ‚Äúseeking out inventions with the mind, and forming those perfect ideas which the hands afterwards express and reproduce from the images already conceived in the brain.‚Äù And I think that‚Äôs true in many different fields. You have to take time away to think. Men of genius sometimes accomplish the most when they work the least. *** BREAK *** Okay, well this all happens in Milan but in 1500 the French invade and take over Milan and Leonardo has to flee for his life. So we will take over from there in part two, but I wanted to highlight a few things that I learned or took away from studying the life of Da Vinci. The first is to strive to be curious. Challenge assumptions. Try to figure out how things work. I don‚Äôt think anyone can make themselves be as curious as Da Vinci. The next is, and this is something that Walter Isaacons highlights in a really beautiful way, is how Leonardo combined observation and fantasy. So in Walter Isaacson‚Äôs book Leonardo Da Vinci he writes ‚ÄúLeonardo was one of history‚Äôs most disciplined observers of nature. But his observation skills colluded with rather than conflicted with his imaginative skills.‚Äù In other words, he wasn‚Äôt just a keen observer of nature, of things that did exist, but he had a great imagination as well and was able to think up things that didn‚Äôt exist.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/leonardo-da-vinci", "title": "Leonardo Da Vinci (Part 1)", "chunk_index": 10, "publication_date": "2023-04-19", "total_chunks_in_doc": 12}}

Leonardo Da Vinci (Part 1): And I think both of those things make the other stronger. I brought up the example of Pixar and talked about how people who are focused on the technical details, are also able to create some of the most creative and soulful art. And I think that‚Äôs getting at the same thing. Observation and imagination aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive, as the quote said they collude. And then the last thing I‚Äôll say is Isaacson has a great line in his biography, he says obsession is a component of genius. And I would add that it is the greatest component of genius. The most important part. And so it‚Äôs easy to look at the life of Leonardo and say ‚ÄúMan, he did some great things, but it is a real waste that he wasn‚Äôt able to complete more of his work. Imagine what he could have done if he was more disciplined about finishing things.‚Äù But I don‚Äôt think it works that way. Leonardo was as great as he was in part because he ruthlessly followed his obsession. And if that meant that he lost interest half way then so be it. And I think that is my biggest takeaway so far.

We are going to cover: Genghis Khan‚Äôs red hair The greatest religious competition of all time The Mongols in Europe The Mongols other conquests The Soviets and their destruction of GK‚Äôs spirit banner Was the Mongol conquest destined to stall out? Carving a path through the forest in Siberia The next truly great ruler of Mongolia was Mongke Khan Btw I have wondered if this has any relationship to Donkey Kong Only thing I could find is that Mario goes back in time in a game called Mario‚Äôs Time Machine and visits Kublai Khan and when he calls him Kubalai Khan, he says, Khan is just a title, you can call me Kublai. So no, I don‚Äôt think Mongke Khan has any connection but Donkey Kong. They sang their orders. They had set songs and melodies and rhythms that they could just alter the words since all the Mongols (basically) were illiterate. This was a pneumonic device to help them remember orders. I think that is pretty cool. Crow swarm or falling stars attack. Ride up shoot, ride away. Encouraged this feeling of inevitability. Good leaders think about strategy and tactics. Great leaders think about psychology. Relate it to the MrBeast episode. He is afraid of dogs Chroniclers of the era attribute to Genghis Khan the highly unlikely statement that, quote, the greatest joy a man can know is to conquer his enemies and drive them before him, to ride their horses and take away their possessions, to see the faces of those who were dear to them bedewed with tears, and to clasp their wives and daughters in his arms. There's stories that, um, the Mongols are so fearsome that in Mosul, one Muslim writer, Ibn al Athir, recounts that he hears, uh, quote, one of them took a man captive. but had not with him any weapon wherewith to kill him. And he said to his prisoner, Lay your head on the ground and do not move. And he did so, and the Tatar went and fetched his sword and slew him therewith. The Mongol empire represents pan-Asianism in the same way that Rome represents pan-Europeanism. And you see the same stuff. Just like Holy Roman Empire is basically germanic and the third reich is even more narrowly German, they still claim descent from Rome. It‚Äôs very tenuous but they claim it. In the same way, the Japanese when they are building out their Asian empire make up this story that Genghis Khan was actually an adventuring samurai.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/ghengis-khan-endnotes", "title": "Ghengis Khan (Endnotes)", "chunk_index": 0, "publication_date": "2023-10-12", "total_chunks_in_doc": 6}}

Karakorum becomes this fabulous but ultimately is unsustainable. Giant silver tree that pours out four different kinds of alcohol: Fermented milk, wine, mead, and rice wine. Four golden serpents around the tree which Mongols loved competitions of all sort. They were like the Greeks in that way. And so at some point, I think it was under Mongke Kong, they organize a religious competition. They had a panel of judges and they bring in some top scholars from Islam, Christianity, and Buddhism. And it‚Äôs a very organized debate. They give them a topic, each group is given a set amount of time to offer their thoughts. Their are rebuttals. But then of course they have to add a Mongol twist to it which is that between each topic, between each round, everyone has to take a drink. So it starts off organized enough, though completely unfruitful, no one is convincing anyone. But at least coherent arguments are being made. But then over time the drinks start to take a toll and its getting rowdier and rowdier and finally it ends up with the Christians singing hymns, the Muslims who don‚Äô sing chanting and reading aloud from the quran, and the Buddhists detaching themselves from it all by silently meditating. One thing that the Mongols really understood was monetary policy and they made extraordinary efforts to issue a stable currency without too much inflation. But this stable, standardized currency is one of the things that really stimulated trade and created this temporary connection between Europe and Asia. Kubalai controls China more through diplomacy and public relations. By being the most Chinese emperor he can be.

Pax Mongolica or Pax Tatarica Kublai Khan sets up an office of agriculture to increase farm productivity Encourage Europeans to set up trading posts on the edge of the black sea Standardizes weights and measurements Standardizes the calendar Europe in particular benefits from the trade, the new technologies, and the new crops, which included carrots, turnips, watercress, buckwheat, and parsnips. Technology included gunpowder and standardized printing processes that would culminate in the European invention of the printing press a little more than a hundred years later In 1288, King Edward I of England received an envoy from kublai Khan. He had traveled more than 7k miles Edward accepted communion from the Mongol envoy, named Rabban Bar Sawma He was a Nestorian Christian He also celebrated mass with the pope on the way back In fact, Christianity had a huge fumble. Eventually most of the Mongol kingdoms ended up Muslim or Buddhist. But if you were a betting man, Christianity actually had probably the most momentum. In fact, Guyuk, who was a grandson of GK, was probably a Christian, his mother certainly was But the pope communicates with him, at this point the Mongols have invaded some Christian lands, and so the pope takes on this very haughty tone, lectures them. And the love affair between the Mongols and Christianity fizzles. There are still many strong Christian communities. But then the black death hits. Jews and Christians blamed. So during the age of exploration Christianity essentially has to be reestablished in Asia. The black death was truly horrible Kills between one half and one third of those in China, does something similar in Europe. Without trade to rely on, the Khans go local.

Nearly 100k soldiers were killed between Hungary and Poland, many of them the best and brightest of European knights. They start coming toward Vienna. And then they vanish.

Their marked advantages of speed, mobility, and surprise were all lost when they had to pick their way through forests, rivers, and plowed fields. with crops and ditches, hedges and wooden fences. It also marked the change from the dry steppe to the humid climates of the coastal zones where dampness caused the Mongol bows to lose strength and accuracy. Christian lands are mostly abandoned, except for some area in Russia and Ukraine surrounding the Black Sea. Eastern Europe was not that wealthy, the one thing they did have was people, good tall strong intelligent people, and so the Mongols conduct an enormous slave trade after this invasion. In fact, that is where they get the word. Where are they getting all of these captives? From the Slavic lands of eastern europe. And they sell so many of these people that their ethnonym, Slav, becomes the word slave. That is where we get the word, from all of these Slavs that Mongols sold. ‚Äç Alright.

And cat eyes no one knows for sure what it means, it seems like green eyes or gray eyes isn‚Äôt an unreasonable explanation. Molecular Genealogy of a Mongol Queen‚Äôs Family and Her Possible Kinship with Genghis Khan Members of the Mongol imperial family (designated the Golden family) are buried in a secret necropolis; therefore, none of their burial grounds have been found.

{"text": "Alexander the Great (Part 1): Alexander the Great (Not Philip) Hello and welcome to How To Take Over The World. This is Ben Wilson. This episode has been a long time coming. It‚Äôs one that I‚Äôm very excited for. What can you say about Alexander the Great? He‚Äôs one of the most impactful men of history. He‚Äôs possibly the greatest conqueror of all time, he established an enormous empire the likes of which the world had never seen - from the Balkans in the west to India in the east, from Armenia in the north to Egypt in the south. As the Greco-Roman biographer Arrian would later say ‚ÄúOne can point to no other man, Greek or barbarian, who performed exploits so numerous and so momentous.‚Äù I am inclined to agree. It‚Äôs also just a great adventure story. One of the reasons that I love the life story of Alexander the Great is that he was the last great military leader who swung his own sword. He was himself a gifted horseman and powerful warrior who was an integral part of his own battles and fought from the front. The final reason that I‚Äôll mention that I love this story is that he inspired so many other greats. Napoleon studied his campaigns, and Julius Caesar famously had his life changed by Alexander. As you‚Äôll recall, Julius Caesar was a young-ish man in Spain who hadn‚Äôt accomplished much of anything. And he came upon a statue of Alexander the Great and burst into tears. Plutarch tells us that - quote - ‚ÄúHis friends were surprised, and asked him the reason of it. ‚ÄòDo you think,‚Äô said he, ‚ÄòI have not just cause to weep, when I consider that Alexander at my age had conquered so many nations, and I have all this time done nothing that is memorable?‚Äô‚Äù He then of course proceeded to found the Roman Empire. I hope that some of you will have your ‚ÄúCaesar moment‚Äù when listening to this podcast and be inspired, like Caesar, to greater things. So let‚Äôs jump into it. But first, one thing: I want to make a small note on my sources. Alexander the Great and His Time by Agnes Savill. Kings and Conquerors by Adrian Goldsworthy. I really enjoyed that one and highly recommend it. The Campaigns of Alexander.

Arrian was a Greco - Roman , born in 86 AD , he was the only man to be both a consul in Rome and the Archon of Athens , the highest civic office of that city . ‚Äç He wrote his Alexander the Great (Part 1): history of Alexander the Great as basically an account of his life and a critical analysis of his virtues and vices. His biography of Alexander is essentially a 2,000 year old episode of How to Take Over the World. ‚Äç I think I‚Äôve talked about the Landmark series before but it really is so good if you like ancient history. For the Landmark Arrian, they have produced a really good translation that is very readable, with tons of clarifying footnotes to help you understand it, and tons of pictures and maps to help you make sense of where the action is taking place. ‚Äç If you‚Äôre a casual fan, it might not be super interesting, but if you‚Äôre even a casual history fan I really recommend it. ‚Äç Anyway, I also mention it because I‚Äôm going to be quoting a ton from Arrian throughout this series. He wrote a very faithful history, he had plenty of access to firsthand accounts so it‚Äôs pretty cool to read these accounts, it really transports you back to Alexander‚Äôs time. ‚Äç Okay, so that‚Äôs it for sources, and finally before we get started, a word from our sponsors. ‚Äç Ad Read ‚Äç I‚Äôm going to give you a little spoiler and tell you about an incident from the middle of Alexander‚Äôs life. On one of his campaign‚Äôs Alexander had one of his officers, a powerful man from a well to do city-state, stripped of his rank. What was this man‚Äôs offense that Alexander would punish him like this? He took a bath in warm water. ‚Äç Wild, right? Why was it so important to Alexander that his men bathe in only cold water? Well, he knew it kept them sharp. And actually, modern science has confirmed the benefits of cold exposure and cold baths specifically. ‚Äç Taking cold baths has been shown to increase blood flow, improve sleep, support your immune system, and boost your mood, among other benefits. ‚Äç That‚Äôs why ice baths are something that I‚Äôve incorporated into my fitness regime for a long time.

So the Greeks are still dominant throughout the Mediterranean in terms of trade, art, philosophy, and culture - but they had lost some of their luster. ‚Äç The greatest world power at the time - at least as far as they knew - was Persia. The Persian empire extended from modern day Turkey all the way to India, and included most of the Middle East, Egypt, Armenia, and more. But like the Greeks, the Persian empire was also viewed as somewhat past its prime. ‚Äç And while it was the twilight of Greek political power, he was born at the time of what is considered a golden age of Greek philosophy. One of the greatest Greek philosophers, Aristotle, was alive at the same time as Alexander and in fact the two knew each other, as we shall soon see. ‚Äç And one of the things these philosophers loved to philosophize about was this question of what has happened to Greece? And how do we make Greece great again? ‚Äç Well one philosopher, Isocrates, basically said that the Greeks had run out of places to expand to and settle. And so they just squabled among themselves. And what they needed to do, according to Isocrates, was invade Persia. That would give them plenty of land and riches. ‚Äç The only problem was that this would take Greek unity. And the Greeks were famously fractious. They were constantly infighting. And it seemed unlikely that they could rally around a leader because they didn‚Äôt want to elevate a single city-state. In other words, Sparta would never follow an Athenian or a Theban or a Corinthian leader, and vice versa. ‚Äç ‚Äç It was fitting then, that the person who eventually united Greece in this cause came from outside of Greece. ‚Äç Philip, Alexander‚Äôs father, was a Macedonian. ‚Äç Macedonia was an undomesticated backwater just north of Greece.

They spoke a Greek dialect and worshiped the same gods as the Greeks, but they were not as developed economically, technologically, or culturally, and didn‚Äôt live in city-states as the Greeks did. ‚Äç But Philip was an unbelievably gifted statesman and military leader and he managed to raise Macedonia up, conquer its neighbors, and eventually bring all of Greece under his dominion. And when he did, with his first act he got them all to agree that they would participate in a combined invasion of Persia. ‚Äç Alexander‚Äôs Childhood: ‚Äç As Philip‚Äôs oldest able-bodied son, Alexander was the heir apparent to the Macedonian kingdom when he was born. ‚Äç And he soon showed himself to be worthy to be Philip‚Äôs heir. He was short but strong and a good sprinter. He was a gifted musician and orator. He was intelligent, strong-willed, impatient, curious, and charming. ‚Äç And we know this isn‚Äôt just propaganda, because we have documented proof of ambassadors and diplomats visiting the Macedonian capital at Pella and being charmed by this precocious young prince. ‚Äç The most famous story from Alexander‚Äôs childhood occured when he was twelve or thirteen years old. He‚Äôs with his father when they come across a horse breeder who wants to show a magnificent horse to Philip. ‚Äç And supposedly this horse is beautiful. Tall and strong with a beautiful dark coat and a white mark on its forehead. The man wants to charge King Philip an unprecedented 13 talents for the horse. Philip scoffs at this price, especially when his groomers are completely unable to tame it. He declines to purchase and is getting ready to leave when Alexander protests. And says they can‚Äôt pass on such a magnificent prize of a horse. ‚Äç And Philip kind of says ‚ÄúOh, you think you can do better than all of my trained, professional stable hands?‚Äù And Alexander basically says ‚ÄúYeah, I think I can.‚Äù So they make a bet. If Alexander can tame the horse, Philip will buy it for him. So Alexander carefully approaches the horse. ‚Äç He had noticed that when the king‚Äôs men had tried leading the horse, it was spooked by its own shadow. So Alexander turns him toward the sun, and starts soothing him and speaking softly to the horse.

Soon he calms to Alexander ‚Äô s presence - who is then able to hop on his back and gallop around , with the horse eventually really letting loose and astounding everyone with his unbelievable speed . ‚Äç It ‚Äô s Alexander the Great (Part 1): a great story, almost certainly an exaggeration, but the horse, named Bucephalus, was real, and he is probably the most famous horse of all time. Bucephalus would accompany Alexander on nearly all of his conquests and Alexander would even end up naming a city Bucacephala after him. ‚Äç So Alexander was this naturally gifted young boy, but he also had the best education that money could buy. And it‚Äôs interesting because he had two distinct types of education. He received a traditional Macedonian education - which was more martial in nature. He learned to ride, to hunt, to swing a sword, and every other skill he would need to know to be an effective warrior. ‚Äç His primary tutor for this phase of his education was a guy named Leonidas, like the famous Spartan king. He‚Äôs a relative of Alexander‚Äôs mother. And he‚Äôs your stereotypical hard-nosed drill-master tough guy teacher. He would go through Alexander‚Äôs stuff and throw out any treats or gifts that his mother had given him. ‚Äç Alexander would later say that ‚ÄúLeonidas‚Äôs idea of breakfast was a night march, and his idea of dinner was a light breakfast.‚Äù He was extremely cheap. He would always butt heads with Alexander over sacrifices. Alexander was very religiously observant, always scrupulous in his observation of proper rituals, sacrifices, prayers, and things like that. ‚Äç And he was always generous in his sacrifices and offerings. Well this bothered Leonidas, who would always tell him he was wasting too much incense in the offering. ‚Äç Later, after a big victory that made Alexander a bunch of money, he sent 18 tons of frankincense and myrrh, ya know, multiple shipping containers full of incense, and essentially as a practical joke he had it dumped on Leonidas‚Äôs front step with a note that said ‚ÄúIn the future I hope you will not be so miserly in your offerings to the gods.‚Äù ‚Äç At age 13, Philip finds Alexander a new tutor, Aristotle. Aristotle is of course one of the great philosophers of the ancient world. And whereas his teacher and mentor, Plato, was more of a purely theoretical philosopher in the tradition of HIS mentor, Socrates, Aristotle was more grounded in reality. In observing nature. He made many important discoveries and observations in biology, geology, and astronomy, in addition to the more typical philosophical field of politics and metaphysics. ‚Äç And it is obviously very intriguing that these two had such a close relationship.

{"text": "biology , geology , and astronomy , in addition to the more typical philosophical field of politics and metaphysics . ‚Äç And it is obviously very intriguing that these two had such a close relationship . Unfortunately , we don ‚Äô t have access to Aristotle ‚Äô s curriculum . Alexander the Great (Part 1): Wouldn‚Äôt you love to know what he taught him and how he taught him? If I could be a fly on the wall in any place at any time, seeing Aristotle tutor Alexander the Great would be way up there. ‚Äç But one thing that you can say is that Alexander had an insatiable curiosity, a love of learning and discovering new things. And I think it very likely that he learned some of that from his famed tutor. ‚Äç ‚Äç Now I said that Alexander was Philip‚Äôs heir apparent. But it‚Äôs a little more complicated than that. ‚Äç Macedonian kings were polygamous - meaning they had multiple wives - and Alexander was born to Philip‚Äôs fourth wife, Olympias. She was the daughter of a nearby king, Neoptolemus of Epirus, and she was a very intelligent, strong-willed woman. ‚Äç And Macedonian royal polygamy was a double-edged sword. It meant that there were plenty of heirs around. But it also meant that there was often conflict for the throne. There was a lot of court intrigue, a lot of plotting, secret murders and poisonings, rebellions - it was very rare for a Macedonian king to die peacefully in his bed. ‚Äç And so Olympias and Alexander are both quite paranoid about Alexander‚Äôs position as heir, especially when Philip marries his seventh wife. Everyone knew that he was planning a big invasion of Persia. And it was anticipated that it would take years to carry out this invasion. So okay, if you‚Äôre going to be gone for years you really need to make sure that your homefront is secure. Philip usually took a new marriage to seal political alliances, and this was no different. ‚Äç So for the first time, Philip takes a native-born Macedonian for his wife. Many Macedonians, especially the nobility, are thrilled about this. But it‚Äôs not a great thing for Alexander because a son born to this marriage would automatically have a strong claim to the throne. ‚Äç Well this situation is made worse at the wedding. One of Philip‚Äôs top generals, a man by the name of Attalus, proposes a toast.

He throws a cup of wine at Attalus and yells ‚ÄúAre you calling me a bastard?‚Äù ‚Äç Philip stands up to try to break up the fight. But by this time he‚Äôs in his mid 40s and he has been through a lot of fighting and has a whole bunch of injuries. Including a permanent limp that he developed when he was stabbed through the thigh with a spear. He‚Äôs also been at a wedding all day and presumably has had a few drinks so when he stands up to try to break up this brewing fight, he trips, and falls flat on his face. ‚Äç And Alexander, still heated, points at Philip and says ‚ÄúLook everyone, this man was planning to cross from Europe to Asia, but he cannot even cross from one couch to another.‚Äù ‚Äç This enrages Philip. A royal wedding was an opportunity for him to cement and reaffirm his power in front of the most important subjects in his kingdom. And instead he‚Äôs humiliated by what is - let‚Äôs face it - a pretty sick burn from Alexander. I mean he really got him with that one. ‚Äç So Philip stands up and he is spitting mad, he draws his sword and wants to kill Alexander. But luckily his friends restrain him, giving Alexander the time he needs to escape. ‚Äç Alexander goes and spends some time with his mother‚Äôs family in Epirus - waiting to see how things will shake out. And all of Philip‚Äôs friends are telling him, look man, you have to make peace with the kid. You can‚Äôt leave for this invasion of Persia without an adult male heir who is capable of ruling in case you die on campaign. ‚Äç And to his credit, Philip takes their advice. He extends the olive branch, brings Alexander back home, and makes peace. ‚Äç Having said that, there is still a little unease between Alexander, his mother Olympias, and Philip. But, needing a strong heir in place, Philip really bends over backwards to accommodate them. As part of that, he has a big monument constructed that has a statue of him and standing right behind him are Olympias and Alexander. Philip is making every effort to re-emphasize that hey, Alexander is my one and only true heir. ‚Äç Another thing he does to assuage their fears is arrange a powerful royal marriage between his daughter and Olympias‚Äôs brother. ‚Äç This wedding is really supposed to be Philip‚Äôs final act before heading", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/alexander-the-great", "title": "Alexander the Great (Part 1)", "chunk_index": 6, "publication_date": "2021-10-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 24}}
{"text": "hey , Alexander is my one and only true heir . ‚Äç Another thing he does to assuage their fears is arrange a powerful royal marriage between his daughter and Olympias ‚Äô s brother . ‚Äç This wedding is really supposed to be Philip ‚Äô s final act before heading Alexander the Great (Part 1): off for Asia to invade the Persian empire. It‚Äôs basically a very elaborate way of saying ‚ÄúHey everyone, I‚Äôm super cool and powerful. And by the way, if I die, Alexander is in charge.‚Äù ‚Äç But as we know if you listened to the Philip episodes, Philip is assassinated at this wedding. ‚Äç Alexander acts very quickly. He‚Äôs obviously in the strongest position to take over his father‚Äôs kingdom, but he needs to worry about rebellions. If the Greeks see even a hint of dissension in the Macedonian ranks or get a whiff of weakness from Alexander, they‚Äôre sure to rebel. So Alexander acts very quickly and is ruthless to consolidate power. ‚Äç One of Philip‚Äôs top nobles and commander, a guy named Antipater, brings the soldiers together at a place called Vergina and carries out the necessary ceremony where the soldiers declare Alexander king as they clash their spears on their shields. Alexander is 20 years old when this happens and he becomes king. ‚Äç After this, Alexander has all other potential rivals killed, including the infant daughter of Philip‚Äôs seventh wife. Women couldn‚Äôt sit the throne, but I guess he must have feared that she could have legitimated the claims of a man by marrying him. At the time, many claimed that Olympias was behind the killings and that she did it out of pure spite and jealousy. It‚Äôs impossible to say now with certainty who ordered the killing and why. ‚Äç In any case, there were three top commanders who Alexander had to reckon with. The first, Antipater, was with Alexander in Macedonia and as we just saw, was immediately loyal and declared him king. One down. ‚Äç The other two were together in Asia Minor, leading Philip‚Äôs advance guard for his invasion force of Persia. Their names were Attalus and Parmenion. ‚Äç Attalus was the same guy who Alexander had thrown the wine at - at the wedding, and he immediately knows that he‚Äôs in danger. There are two stories, one is that he writes to Athens, asking them to join him in rising up against Alexander, but then changes his mind. Attalus of course tells a different story. He claims that Demonsthenes of Athens wrote to HIM but he rejected the offer to rebel. ‚Äç For Alexander, who hates Attalus, it probably wouldn‚Äôt have mattered either way. He writes to Parmenion and basically says ‚ÄúHey could you do me a solid and prove your loyalty by killing Attalus?‚Äù ‚Äç Attalus was actually Parmenion‚Äôs", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/alexander-the-great", "title": "Alexander the Great (Part 1)", "chunk_index": 7, "publication_date": "2021-10-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 24}}

But before Alexander can carry out his father‚Äôs dream and invade Persia, he needs to make sure that his broader empire is obedient and his borders secure. ‚Äç For his first act, Alexander calls together all the Greek city-states, in something called the League of Corinth. This was an organization established by Philip that was essentially a puppet state for him to control all of Greece. Except for Sparta, who refused to join. But basically all the other Greek city-states belonged to this League of Corinth. ‚Äç And Alexander calls them together at Corinth to affirm him as the heir to his father‚Äôs throne and essentially the master of Greece. So they all show up and say Alexander, you are totally king, you‚Äôre very powerful, you‚Äôre very cool, your jokes are funny, we love you. ‚Äç While visiting Corinth, many of the city‚Äôs exceptional residents came to Alexander with their congratulations. However, one significant absence was the philosopher, Diogenes the Cynic. ‚Äç Diogenes was a controversial figure. He accused everyone of corruption. He critized society and lived outside of society. He lived in a barrel outside the city, only wore one simple roughspun garment, and basically lived as a homeless vagrant. That is why the school that he founded is known as cynicism which literally means dog-like. In other words implying that Diogenes lived like a dog. ‚Äç Alexander, called on Diogenes, but he was basically given the response that ‚Äúif Alexander wants to meet me, he knows where to find me.‚Äù Alexander trekked to the philosopher‚Äôs barrel outside the city where he found Diogenes sun-bathing. The philosopher took little notice of Alexander and after the king offered Diogenes his greetings, Alexander proceeded to ask Diogenes if he wanted anything. Diogenes is said to have raised himself up a little and remarked, ‚Äúmove a little to the side, you‚Äôre in the way of the sun.‚Äù ‚Äç As they walked away, members of Alexander‚Äôs retinue were making fun of Diogenes but Alexander silenced them, saying, ‚Äúif I were not Alexander, I would wish to be Diogenes.‚Äù ‚Äç ‚Äç So Alexander returns from Corinth with his empire firmly in control. ‚Äç He then turns his eyes toward securing his borders in preparation for carrying out the invasion of Persia.

You don‚Äôt want your first game to be the Super Bowl, so to speak. ‚Äç So he marches around to Thrace and Illyria and beats up on some barbarians for a bit. During one of these battles, Alexander receives an injury. Nothing major, but combined with the fact that he‚Äôs been away from the capital for a few months now, this injury snowballs into a rumor that Alexander is dead. ‚Äç Well, when this rumor reaches Greece, Thebes, one of the major city-states there, starts celebrating and they declare their freedom from Macedonia. ‚Äç Alexander leaves Thrace and force marches his troops all the way to Thebes. He gets their with astonishing rapidity. Weeks before anyone would have believed he could have done it. As you‚Äôll recall, fast marching is a hallmark of great conquerors. And Alexander could march with the best of them. He was lightning fast. ‚Äç When the Thebans see his advance guard, they think that there is no way this is Alexander, who was just in Thrace. They literally refuse to believe it‚Äôs him. We heard he‚Äôs dead and besides, there‚Äôs no way he could have marched that quickly from Thrace to here. ‚Äç Alexander besieges Thebes, and there‚Äôs actually a battle outside the city walls, the Thebans think they have a chance in open combat so they bring their men outside the city walls. Alexander‚Äôs men see an opportunity and commit themselves without his explicit command. But in their haste they overextend and are counter charged by the Thebans. But the Thebans make the same mistake and are counter-counter-charged by Alexander‚Äôs forces. ‚Äç The Thebans retreat so hastily that they are unable to close the city gates behind them, and Alexander‚Äôs men flood into the city and lay waste to it, massacring thousands of Thebans. In the end, Alexander decides that the city has been so thoroughly destroyed by his men that it‚Äôs beyond saving - plus it had been rebellious besides. So he destroys it and enslaves the remainder of the populace. ‚Äç Now there is some awkwardness.

Hey we were super glad you were alive, even if we forgot to show it. I was happy to see you, I just forgot to smile. ‚Äç ‚Äç With Thebes destroyed and all of Greece pacified, Alexander finally decides he is secure enough to carry on his father‚Äôs legacy, complete his vision, and invade Persia. The ostensible reasons for the invasion were due to some Persian invasion 200 years prior and some temples they had destroyed when they were there. ‚Äç It was also supposedly for the liberation of some Greek city-states in Anatolia that were under Persian rule. But the thing is, the Greeks actually didn‚Äôt really mind Persian rule for the most part. They were known as pretty laid back rulers. ‚Äç In addition, they were also known as very good paymasters when it came to hiring mercenaries. And the number one place they liked to hire mercenaries from was Greece. As a consequence, though Alexander was supposedly fighting a crusade for Greek liberty, in the end more Greeks ended up fighting for his enemies than for him. ‚Äç It was a pretty flimsy pretext, and everyone knew that it had more to do with winning glory and riches. And frankly because he thought he could. ‚Äç But why did he think he could? Why was he so sure that he could just march into the biggest empire on earth and beat them on their home turf? ‚Äç Remember, Persia was past its prime, but it was still THE dominant power in the known world to these people. They would have armies many times the size of Alexander‚Äôs. ‚Äç Well the reasons were supreme self-confidence in his abilities as a commander on the part of Alexander and Greek chauvinism on the other hand. The Greeks truly believed that they were better than everyone else. And to their credit, they were some of the fiercest fighters in the world, especially when it came to their heavy infantry. ‚Äç Alexander‚Äôs father, Philip, had created a new infantry tactic that was virtually unbeatable. Traditional Greek hoplites wielded spears about 7 or 8 feet long, but Philip had trained his men to use great long pikes called sarissas that were more like 15 feet long. ‚Äç With these pikes you could have 4 or more ranks of men jabbing the enemy.

Philip and Alexander typically used them to hold the enemy in place and then Alexander the Great (Part 1): strike with their cavalry to finish them off. ‚Äç So it‚Äôs with great optimism that Alexander invades Persia.He crosses the Hellespont - that‚Äôs the narrow little strip of water in modern day Turkey that separates Europe from Asia - and he starts marching toward the interior of Asia Minor, that‚Äôs modern day Turkey. ‚Äç Alexander‚Äôs opponent, - The King of Persia - was named Darius. He had a number of generals and advisors. One of the senior ones was a Greek by the name of Memnon. Memnon advised Darius to go scorched earth strategy. He said that the Macedonian infantry was far superior to their own, and they shouldn‚Äôt risk open warfare. ‚Äç He advised they burn all of the crops and all of the towns. Don‚Äôt give Alexander a chance to gain a toehold or gain supplies. It‚Äôs a great strategy, and it probably would have worked, but the native Persian advisors of Darius prevailed. ‚Äç They say in effect, Darius, you‚Äôre the king of kings, this is THE GOSH DANG PERSIAN EMPIRE, and you‚Äôre expecting us to cower before this upstart kid from nowhere? C‚Äômon. Be serious. ‚Äç We‚Äôre not going to burn one stalk of grain. We‚Äôre going to go beat him in battle. ‚Äç So against Memnon‚Äôs counsel, they march their army to the border of the Granicus river. ‚Äç Alexander meets them there. The two armies camp on either side of the river, and Alexander‚Äôs chief advisor, Parmenion, advises him to wait. It‚Äôs risky to attack over a river, they‚Äôll suffer casualties, and he‚Äôs sure that if he just waits overnight, they can attack them at dawn and surprise them. In fact I‚Äôll just read the exact quote: ‚Äç P28 of Arrian. ‚Äç We can see that Alexander was very focused on the psychology of his men. And great generals are always focused on morale. On momentum. As Napoleon is purported to have said, more battles are lost by loss of hope than loss of blood.

There was a great silence on both sides. The Persians were waiting for the Macedonians to enter the river, intending to attack them when they climbed out.‚Äù ‚Äç You can imagine this moment. Years of planning, hundreds of miles of marching, hundreds of thousands of men, have all led up to this. Alexander‚Äôs entire life has all led up to this.

There was a shoving match between the two cavalries - one emerging from the river, the other barring its way - and a dense shower of javelins hurled by the Persians, while the Macedonians assailed the enemy with their spears. But the Macedonians, far outnumbered, suffered in the first assault; they were defending themselves from a low and insecure position in the river, whereas the Persians were assailing them from above. What is more, the strongest contingent of the Persian cavalry had been stationed at this spot. Thus the first Macedonians to engage the Persians, though they showed themselves brave, were cut to pieces.‚Äù ‚Äç Alexander, seeing this massacre, doesn‚Äôt retreat, but hurries to the spot with the rest of the cavalry of the right wing. ‚ÄúBringing up the right wing, Alexander now drew near and himself launched an attack on the Persians at the point where the mass of their cavalry had been posted and where the Persian commanders had been stationed.‚Äù ‚Äç This would be a hallmark of Alexander‚Äôs style.

It becomes something of a shoving match. Alexander himself exposes himself to great danger. ‚Äç P30, paragraph 6. ‚Äç Now remember, the Macedonians fight with sarissas. These big 15 foot pikes. This has advantages and disadvantages. But one advantage is that this fighting style tends to wear down the enemy over time. ‚Äç Imagine you‚Äôre a Persian cavalryman during this battle. You charge in, and at first things are going alright. The Macedonians have these big long pikes, but they can‚Äôt get much thrusting force because they‚Äôre so long.

That he was the rightful King, and that he was only temporarily being dispossessed by Darius, who was stubbornly refusing to let Alexander take his rightful throne. And on a certain level, this was effective in portraying a sense of inevitability that he would eventually win. ‚Äç The one place where he does change the administration is in any Greek city-states in Asia minor, of which there were many. He abolishes the oligarchies, establishes democracies in their stead, and cancels their taxes. ‚Äç Despite all of this, capitulation to Alexander is not total And he has to march around and attacking or besieging holdout towns in order to subdue them. This goes on all fall. In the winter, Alexander sends home any recently married troops so that they can go take care of their business and frankly impregnate their new wives. Alexander himself remains with his older troops - the poor guys who don‚Äôt get to go home to get laid, and together they conduct more mopping up operations in Asia Minor. ‚Äç It is during these mopping up operations that Alexander comes to the city of Gordian.

His army once again at full strength, Alexander marches toward Syria. ‚Äç ‚Äç But he was not going to be able to march through the rest of the Persian empire unchecked. Darius himself had not been present at the Battle of the Granicus River, and he was now leading the full force of the Persian army, and he was pursuing Alexander. ‚Äç When Alexander hears that Darius is in the area, he marches straight for him. In fact, Darius and Alexander are both looking for each other, and they pass each other. This is dangerous for Alexander because it cuts off his supply line. ‚Äç So he turns his army around and meets Darius and the Persian army at Issus. ‚Äç He‚Äôs in a very familiar position. Once again, he has to be the attacker, and must attack over a river. Unlike at the Granicus, where the forces were pretty close to equal, his army is VASTLY outnumbered this time. ‚Äç The night before the battle, Arrian tells us that Alexander ‚Äúsaid everything a brave leader would naturally say to hearten brave men on the even of a dangerous venture, and his troops approached him from all sides, clasped their king by the hand one by one, and with encouraging words urged him to lead them out at once.‚Äù ‚Äç The next day, Alexander leads them out to the battlefield, only to find that Darius has begun to build rudimentary defensive fortifications on the opposite bank. This is a sensible thing for Darius to do, since he knows that Alexander has to attack. But Alexander uses it to his advantage, telling his men ‚ÄúThis made it clear that Darius, in his own mind, had already been humbled in spirit.‚Äù In other words, he knew he couldn‚Äôt face Alexander in open battle, and was too afraid to attack. ‚Äç Once again the armies line up.

So he ‚Äô s drawing a contrast . ‚Äç Finally the time comes for the battle to begin . Once again , Alexander Alexander the Great (Part 1): leads the right wing, Parmenion leads the left wing, and the infantry are stationed at the center. And once again Alexander leads the initial charge. This charge is largely successful. But it‚Äôs unfortunately too successful. Alexander leads too far out and becomes separated from his infantry. ‚Äç They try to attack the Greek mercenaries at Darius‚Äôs center, and are largely unsuccessful. In fact, they‚Äôre faring pretty poorly. ‚Äç At the same time, Parmenion‚Äôs forces on the left wing are attacked by the Persian cavalry on that wing and are also looking like they are losing. ‚Äç So Alexander is winning on the right flank, but it‚Äôs looking like it won‚Äôt be enough since his center and his left flank are being beaten. ‚Äç But that‚Äôs when Alexander pulls out his signature move. His stone-cold stunner, his RKO, his PEOPLE‚ÄôS ELBOW. ‚Äç He takes the men with him, the companion cavalry, essentially the special forces of the Macedonian army, and he charges straight at the back of the Persian infantry, right where Darius and the Persian command are located. ‚Äç Darius, who is in a war chariot as was the Persian tradition, flees the battlefield. And when the rest of the Persian army sees the King of Kings, a god among men, fleeing before ALexander, they too turn and run. ‚Äç Alexander was a genius at this. He understood the one thing he needed to achieve in order to win, and then he assembled an extremely strong, highly concentrated force to achieve it. ‚Äç He is once again cutting the gordian knot, so to speak. He realizes he doesn‚Äôt actually have to untie the knot, just undo it. Similarly, he doesn‚Äôt necessarily need to beat all of Darius‚Äôs hundreds of thousands of men, he just needed to beat Darius. ‚Äç Don‚Äôt be like Darius. Be like Alexander. Don‚Äôt try to win everywhere, try to identify the one thing that you need to achieve that will unlock everything else. Then concentrate all of your energy and your best resources on achieving that one thing. ‚Äç I see this happen to me all the time when I‚Äôm planning out my week. I‚Äôll have this big long list of things I need to get done. And there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that, I do need to get a lot of those things done.

But it ‚Äô s actually much more effective to focus 80 % of my energy on the one or two things that are really going to make Alexander the Great (Part 1): a difference. ‚Äç Now after Darius flees, Alexander would like to pursue him but there‚Äôs a problem. Parmenion is still getting owned by the Persian cavalry, and about half of the Macedonian infantry are also in trouble. So rather than pursuing, Alexander has to wheel around and save the rest of his army. ‚Äç The battle is won, but Darius escapes. Though he leaves his chariot, his shield, his cloak, and his bow in his haste to get away. ‚Äç Alexander tries to catch up with him, but he‚Äôs too late. But in the Persian camp he does find Darius‚Äôs mother and wife. ‚Äç And Alexander‚Äôs men are wondering, what are you going to do? Are you going to execute them? Are you going to have them publicly humiliated? Hold them for ransom? Imprison them? Cut off their hair? I mean this is ancient warfare, there were plenty of nasty options. ‚Äç But Alexander says what I want you to do, is take them, put them in a royal tent, refer to them as your highness, bring them the nicest food we can spare, and in all ways, continue to treat them like the queens of Persia. Which seems like an odd choice at first. I mean, aren‚Äôt these the people he‚Äôs supposed to be overthrowing? ‚Äç And it actually reminds me of a story from the life of Julius Caesar. ‚Äç When Caesar won his final battle in the civil war, his men go to the tent of the enemy general Cato, and they find a chest with all of his letters. Now this is a juicy find because it was a dirty civil war with lots of people switching sides and professing to support one side but secretly supporting another and all this sorts of stuff. ‚Äç And so with these letters, Caesar and his supporters can finally find out who were really their friends all along, and who had only been pretending. Over the previous decades, there had been a series of bloody murders and executions, what were called the proscriptions. And so the assumption was hey, we‚Äôre going to look at these letters and find out who was really opposing you this entire time. ‚Äç And his men are giddy at this find and they come back to Caesar and say ‚ÄúWhat do you want us to do with these?‚Äù ‚Äç And Caesar says, thank you for these letters, now kindly put them on a pyre and burn them all.

To take retribution on his enemies would be to admit that he still had enemies. ‚Äç And in his view he didn‚Äôt. He was the one legitimate ruler of the Roman empire. ‚Äç And Alexander is doing the same thing. He‚Äôs essentially saying look, I just beat Darius. I‚Äôm the King of Kings now. These women are not only my subjects, but they‚Äôre essentially my family now, since they were related to the old king of kings. ‚Äç He‚Äôs establishing continuity with the old rulers. Look, it‚Äôs the same kingdom, there‚Äôs just a new guy at the top, but you‚Äôre going to keep paying your same taxes and obeying the same laws. It‚Äôs a genius strategy. ‚Äç In a matter of weeks, Darius manages to make his way back to the heart of the Persian empire. Many of his forces having survived, he feels beaten and humbled, but not completely defeated. And so he writes to Alexander and makes a request and a proposal. ‚Äç Arrian summarizes what Darius wrote, quote: ‚Äç ‚ÄúTheir battle‚Äôs outcome had doubtless accorded with the will of some god, and as a king he was now asking a king for his wife, mother, and captured children, and was also ready to form a friendship and an alliance with Alexander.‚Äù ‚Äç In a followup letter, Darius offers Alexander all of Persian territory from the Euphrates to the Greek sea, that‚Äôs modern Iraq, Syria, Turkey, Jordan, Palestine, Israel, and Egypt.

Alexander is 23 years old. He could accept the deal and go down in history as one of the greatest conquerors of all time. His empire would be 1A and 1B with the Persian empire, they would basically co-rule the world together. He‚Äôd be, along with Darius, the most powerful and wealthy man in the world. ‚Äç This is like being 23 years old and having someone offer to acquire the company that you own 100% for $200 billion dollars.

He says in essence this: Hey Darius, first of all if you want your wife, mother, and children back, come to my court and ask for them. You will not be harmed, you will be given your family back, as well as anything else that you can convince me to give you. Secondly, I will marry your daughter if I choose to.

In the future, please refer to me as the king of Asia. ‚Äç X o x o - Alex ‚Äç Arrian tells us ‚ÄúWhen Darius heard this, he gave up hope of coming to terms with Alexander, and again set about preparing for war.‚Äù ‚Äç For Alexander, being the most accomplished Greek king of all time was not enough. Being co-emperor of Persia was not enough. He had set out to conquer the entire Persian empire.

Napoleon was never bothered by his height . I can ‚Äô t say Alexander the Great (Part 1): for sure whether Alexander was ever bothered by his own height. There don‚Äôt seem to be any stories in which he gets mad at anyone for mentioning his height. Indeed, there‚Äôs at least one story of him being good natured about it. ‚Äç But for whatever reason, where his father was confident and comfortable in his body, Alexander was not. Philip‚Äôs comfort can be observed with his sexual conquests. By contrast, Alexander was almost completely asexual. We know he had at least a couple lovers, but that was probably it. Still Alexander spoke about not enjoying sex because of a lack of control. ‚Äç In fact, Alexander hated sex and he hated sleep because he felt those were the times when he was not in control of his body. All of this is to state that he possessed this slight insecurity to him where his father did not. ‚Äç So Alexander is the heir apparent when he‚Äôs born. ‚Äç Alexander was similar to his father in many ways. He was just as brilliant and just as energetic. Just as charismatic and charming. ‚Äç But Alexander was also different in a few key ways. Whereas Philip was tall, Alexander was short. And where he was bearded and dark-haired, Alexander was always clean shaven and was known for his notable light hair. This sometimes gets embellished to him having white or platinum blond hair but one the more reliable accounts say that his hair was ‚Äútawny like a lion‚Äôs‚Äù which seems much more likely. ‚Äç To think about a lion‚Äôs hair color - that could range from dark blonde to light brown or even a little reddish. ‚Äç Alexander had light eyes. Probably light blue or greyish blue. And a ruddy complexion. ‚Äç He was presumably well-built, as he was athletically gifted and a great sprinter. ‚Äç And as I said earlier, he‚Äôs intelligent and charismatic, and he demonstrates as much from an early age. ‚Äç He‚Äôs a talented musician, orator, athlete, and diplomat. ‚Äç It‚Äôs said that this experience moved Philip to tears who declared, ‚Äúmy son, Macedonia is too small a kingdom for you.‚Äù ‚Äç Alexander was eager to prove this to his father and often responded poorly at the news of Philip‚Äôs victories.

He proved impatient embarking upon mini campaigns , disputably unnecessary . ‚Äç In one instance , Alexander traveled to a community just outside the kingdom where excitement was mounting among the tribesmen . Alexander identified trouble Alexander the Great (Part 1): and questionably set to depopulate the society. Re-populating the land with Macedonian settlers and setting it about his way, Alexander renamed the community Alexandropolis after himself. Alexander was anxious to model his father‚Äôs success who Alexander did not feel close to per Philip‚Äôs frequent absence away on campaigns. ‚Äç It seems important to note that Olympias and Alexander carried a sort of insecurity throughout their lives toward their relationship with Philip the II. But it is also worth noting that when Philip immortalized himself as King of Macedon in a stone rotunda?, he only chose to include Olympias and Alexander though he had significantly more wives and family. ‚Äç ‚Äç It‚Äôs a worth a moment to compare Philip and Alexander. Philip was a truly remarkably gifted man. His life and success are worth taking a detailed review of as Philip was extremely accomplished. We know Philip was tall. He was handsome. He was gifted in terms of interpersonal skills. He made friends extremely easily. Many were charmed by him. It all made sense because Philip was intelligent and exceptionally capable. ‚Äç Philip was also exceedingly skilled as a military commander. He governed his domestic affairs really well. He was great at accumulating wealth. He built Macedon into a prosperous kingdom which elevated its reputation abroad. Philip seduced a lot of women and likely had many bastards. He seduced a lot of men, because hey, these were Greek times. He could be labled a Rockstar, a man‚Äôs man, the ultimate chap. ‚Äç Alexander acquired his most famous tutor at the age of 13 or 14 years old when his father secured Aristotle. Philip bargained the rebuild of Aristotle‚Äôs hometown for the trade of Alexander‚Äôs education. As the product of direct tutoring of one of the greatest philosophers of the classical enlightenment era, there are strong arguments to be made for the progressive philosophic thought experiments these philosophers employed. ‚Äç One could argue that Aristotle‚Äôs philosophical contribution was the argument for practicality beyond the employ of pure reason. Where Socrates and Plato explored intuition, experience, and reasoning, Aristotle employed a practical methodology resembling something akin to what we call science. His keen observation gave way for the reasoning of the mind to influence its application in the world. Throughout Alexander‚Äôs campaigns, he often sent Aristotle exotic specimens to inspect as Alexander continued under the guidance of Aristotle. ‚Äç Alexander received the quintessential Greek classical education.

And you'll see in the title of this episode that I have dubbed him, Phillip, the great. Why is that? Uh, Uh, no, no one calls him Napa. I think he should be called Phillip. The great , uh, and the reason for that is I want to give a little analogy. I want you to think back to the movie. Uh, if you've seen it, , in, in the first iron man movie, Tony stark played by Robert Downey Jr. Is a Playboy billionaire who owns a major weapons manufacturer. He's a genius level engineer who can build these incredible weapons. And at the beginning of the first movie, he's captured by terrorists and basically enslaved and forced to build a bomb for them in this little cave in Afghanistan, he's got one assistant to help him, a guy, a fellow slave by the name of Yansen.

Well , unbeknownst to the terrorists , he ' s also building a super suit , the first iron man suit , because you know , Tony stark is this genius and he ' s able to build it in a K with nothing but scrap metal Philip the Great: and spare parts. And at the very end, his assistant units and dies, and Tony uses his iron man suit to blast his way out, kill the terrorist and escape his imprisonment. okay. So I want you to imagine this scenario, but with one small difference, imagine that Tony stark builds the suit from scrap metal and. But then he's the one who's killed and his assistant incen uses the suit to blast his way out and escape in that scenario. Who's the real hero. The guy who built the super suit from scratch in a cave or the guy who just used it. And so obviously, you know, , I think everyone would agree that the major achievement is, is building a super iron man suit out of scrap metal. And in this analogy, Phillip is Tony stark and Alexander. The great is Yansen. Phillip takes Masad on a small backwater kingdom. That's just nobody it's constantly invaded, rated controlled by its neighbors. And he turns it into the dominant regional power. He takes over Greece. Essentially. He draws up plans for an invasion of Persia, the largest empire on earth. He builds the army to invade Persia. . He sends an expeditionary force, gets everything ready and prepared for the. And then he dies. And then his son Alexander is the one who actually conducts the invasion and establishes the largest empire the world had ever seen. Spoiler alert. Sorry, if you didn't know what Alexander did. Um, but I think that Philip is under-credited as the mastermind of this entire thing. So anyway, I'm not trying to take anything away from Alexander. I think his father Philip also deserves credit for being a truly great conqueror and statesman in his own. Right. so let's jump into his story, but first, a quick word from our sponsor. So to start off with, where did Philip come from and how did he rise? Phillip was born a prince of Mastodon or Macedonia. I'll mostly say mass it on. But if I slip up and say Macedonia, they mean the same thing. Macedonia is a region that mostly lies in the far north of what is the modern country of Greece. And partly in the country of what is now called Northern Macedonia Pella. The city where Phillip was born is in modern day, Greece and Mastodon had this sort of weird relationship with Greece. It existed on the periphery of the Greek world.

It existed on the periphery of the Greek world . Macedonians sort of considered themselves Greeks and Greeks definitely did not Philip the Great: consider Macedonians to be so the Macedonian language was extremely closely related to Greek. Um, could really even be called a dialect of Greek. It was mostly mutually intelligible, sort of like Spanish and Portuguese. Uh, probably actually even a little more similar, maybe something more like Spanish and Portuguese, you know, three or 400 years ago, they did have claims of common descent with the Greeks. They worshiped the same gods as the Greeks, but they culturally had some significant differences with them. They were less developed, less wealthy. Uh, Uh, one of the main things that separated Macedonians was that they didn't have city states. They had many towns and urban areas, even a few cities, but they didn't center their identities on these city states what the Greeks called policies. The Macedonians were more tribal and tended to place more emphasis on their family or bloodline. So anyway, they were kind of Greek, , but the Greeks viewed them as these sort of uneducated, undefined, barbaric, semi Greeks, and Macedonians looked at the Greeks as decadent degenerates. Um, that's maybe a overly negative view of it. Uh, Uh, it wasn't all bad blood. There was definitely some mutual admiration, especially from the Macedonians who really admired many aspects of Greek culture, art music, and all of that. Now Phillip is born a prince of Mastodon. So that means a life of good living and luxury. Right. He's he's royalty. Well, yes and no he's nobility. So yes, he spends most of the time feasting hunting and making. Rather than farming or working in manual labor, but Mastodon was a very rough and tumble place. And the Macedonian Kings were not exempt from that rough and humble nature. And they almost never met peaceful ends. I mean, here are the names and manner of death of the eight Kings of Mastodon. Before Phillip first, we have a king who consolidated and basically founded Macedonia, a guy named Alexander. The first he is assassinated and the kingdom is taken over by his son PIR to kiss the second purchase. The second is assassinated by his illegitimate son Archaius who takes over as king before he is assassinated by his friend and lover. There's a big civil war and a guy named .

He is succeeded by his Philip the Great: son Alexander the second, but he is. Yep. You guessed it assassinated by his son, Ptolemy, who is say it with me assassinated by Phillip's older brother who takes over and manages to not get assassinated. Um, but only by dying in battle. So you had the idea of the rough lifestyle. These people lived, the Macedonians were still kind of wild and that included the nobility. This was at a time when it was still expected that Kings and generals would actually get their hands dirty and swing their swords. Often in the front lines and not just command from the back. And it was a time when assassination was obviously, as we just saw very common and almost sort of accepted tool of regime change. The Macedonian Kings of this era were all from this one family called the dynasty. Every Macedonian king was an RD ad with no exceptions and no one really even tried or challenged this rule. We're not quite sure why this one dynasty had such a hold on the public imagination that everyone just sort of accepted that they should be the Kings. They did claim to be of Greek descent. Their origin story is that they were descended from an aristocrat from the city of Argos, a descendant of Hercules, very illustrious guy who conquered Macedonia, but you know, those kinds of stories were common in those days. Um, but you know, for whatever reason, everyone agreed that the king should be an arc yet, but they're unchallenged status as Kings of Mastodon. Didn't bring with it a tradition of stability as he might. And that's because while the RD ads were unchallenged as Kings, any are GAD could be king. Uh, Uh, there doesn't appear to have been a very fixed succession rule. If you were the eldest son of the past king, and you were a competent leader of, you know, whole mind and whole body, then you'd probably be in pole position, but a cousin or a half-brother could always swoop in, if you weren't careful and RD ads were polygamous , um, or at least the Kings were polygamous. So there were always plenty of men to vie for the throne. So they had multiple wives, they fought in the front lines of their battles. And when you hear about their exploits, you get the impression that these arguer ads were just this crazy hard drinking.

A bunch of men who liked women gambling and fighting and Mastodon was the kind of violent , wild place where that type of person could Philip the Great: thrive. It was said that a Macedonian boy wasn't allowed to recline at dinner with the adults until he had killed a boar without the use of a net, just with a spear. So strength capacity for violence, vitality, the ability to drink large quantities of alcohol, all of these things were highly valued in Macedonia. It was the land of the chats. And Phillip grows up in this environment and definitely takes on many Macedonian attributes. But when he's 12, he also gets the chance to get a first rate education. There's a peace treaty. That's forced on Mastodon. And as part of it, Philip, the younger brother of the king, you sent to be a hostage in the city, state of Thebes, the idea of hostages in the ancient sense is something that is foreign to us. Now, when we think of hostages , um, um, we probably think of like a terrorist holding someone in a camp, threatening to cut off their finger, unless you send them $10,000 by Saturday or whatever. Hostage taking in the pre-modern world was nothing like that. It was something very different. The hostage taker would treat the hostage like a member of their household to be raised and educated and would be sent back home. Once they reached adulthood, they were treated very well and encouraged to befriend the children in the household. So there is this catch though, which is that there's an implicit threat that if the family of the hostage acts up, the hostage will be executed. So it has this weird dual purpose. On the one hand, it ensures good behavior because you'll kill the hostage. If their family crosses you. And on the other hand, it was supposed to foster friendships because the children of one state are growing up with and being educated with the children of another it's like the world's weirdest summer camp is the only thing I can think to compare it, to learn important, life lessons, make friendships that will last a lifetime. Maybe get executed at the end. Try not to focus on that. But luckily for Philip, he is not executed and even more lucky for him. He's raised in Thebes, which is the preeminent military power in Greece at the time.

And not only that , but he ' s housed , educated and raised by a man named , who was a military leader and who was very close with a guy named , who was the star general of the time , not only in Philip the Great: Thebes, but of the entire Greek world, Macedonia had been a backwater, a semi civilized frontier territory, but now here's Philip getting a military education from the very best of the business. We don't know for certain that he learned directly from , but it seems plausible. And certainly at the very least he was able to observe firsthand . How the Phoebe army functioned and was organized So he's in Thebes from age 12 to about age 17 or 18. And I have to point out that this is a pattern for tons of great conquers and achievers. They're half outsiders, half insiders. So think about Napoleon he's a well-to-do card-carrying French aristocrat, right? No one can challenge the status as officially notable. So he is half insider, but he's also a Corsican , uh, he's. He speaks in Italian dialect as his first language. He always speaks French with an accent. So he's definitely half outsider or think about Steve jobs. He's literally raised in Silicon valley and interns for Hewlett Packard, the quintessential Silicon valley company, as a high schooler, definitely an insider, but he's also adopted biologically the son of a Syrian immigrant. And for that reason always felt like a little bit of an outsider. These people are insiders enough to have access to the resources and education of the dominant system, but outsiders enough that they aren't caught up in the same way of thinking as everyone else who came before them. And Phillip fits that mold perfectly. He's a semi barbarian Macedonian. Who's being educated by one of the preeminent military powers in Greece and therefore in the world, half insider, half outside. now when Phillip reaches adulthood and his time as a hostage comes to an end, he goes back to Macedonia and is given command of some Eastern regions by his brother. the king of Macedonia. Phillip administers, these regions capably or so we think , um, frankly, there just aren't a ton of records about this part of Phillip's life, but that all changes a few years later when pertussis leads a third of the Macedonian army against the tribal people called the Elyria. Since the battle is a complete disaster, purdah kisses killed and his army is completely wiped out.

And the librarians follow this up by invading Mastodon and rating and looting at - will it ' s total chaos for a series of weeks pertussis . His son is only a boy . And with the is running Philip the Great: amok, the Macedonians know they need a strong king. So Phillips steps forward and seizes the throne and is proclaimed king by the army. He's only 22 or perhaps 23, when he becomes king to say that Phillips rural, it was precarious at the beginning would be a huge understatement. The Alerian is our rating and plundering and the and other Western barbarian people see this chaos and figure, Hey, we want a piece of the spoils. We want some of that action. So they also start reading Massad on another tribal people, these ones on the Eastern side of acid on see the situation and they want a piece to , uh, uh, they're a little more organized and civilized than the Syrians and pay Ionians. So they get a puppet, a half-brother of Phillips who they're hoping to install on the throne and the Greek city-state Athens does the same thing. They dig up a half-brother RG ad, who they're going to try and sit on the throne to be there. So you've got all these vultures circling because they can feel that the whole Macedonian kingdom might just collapse. Third of their army is destroyed. There's this brand new king , uh, who no one really knows. He's only been in the country for five years. He grew up in Thebes and foreign pillagers are running a mock and rating towns at will so in most people's minds, Phillip is a dead man walking, um, but Phillip is, you know, obviously not your average king, he Springs into action. The first thing he does is execute arrival, claimant one of his half brothers and forced two other claimants to escape into exile. The ones backed by Athens and grace. And then luckily he gets a breather. It was the practice at a time for everyone to basically go home. In classical societies, the vast, vast majority of these people were not professional soldiers. They were mostly farmers or in the case of barbarians, like herdsmen and fishermen. So they needed to go home, tend to their affairs, you know, fall harvest, spring, planting, all of that. So over autumn and winter of 360 BC, all these Raiders go home and Phillip has time to reorganize and prepare for these numerous pending invasions.

So the first task for Philip is to rally the people of Macedonia behind him . He ' s getting ready to go for on one Macedonia against Philip the Great: race, Athens, Elyria, and Pena. But first he has to make sure he even has the one, because if you're a Macedonia noble with a few villages and a few hundred soldiers behind you, nothing about this situation is screaming. Let's get behind Philip and support him. He doesn't necessarily seem like the safe bet. But Phillip goes on a charm offensive. He's going around to the parties, shaking hands, kissing babies, showing off how smart and intelligent, clever he is. Uh, Uh, in the words of the ancient Greek historian, Daya, Doris, he says, quote, bringing together the Macedonians in a series of assemblies and exhorting them with eloquent speeches to be men. He was courteous and sought to win over the multitudes by his gifts and his promises. Okay. So a few things about that. Number one, by all accounts, Phillip was extremely charismatic. He had this almost magical sway over people. They were immediately naturally drawn to him. Part of that might have been that he had the natural aspect of a leader. He was nearly six feet tall, which was very tall for the time and was apparently quite handsome, which helps obviously when you're trying to charm people. Um, Um, so Phillip is getting gifts and making promises, as you might expect, you know, support me in, I'll make you Lord over such and such an area and give you these territories. But to me, the most interesting line in there is that he exhorted them to be. He's challenging them, challenging their manhood. It gives me a little bit of those old tiny Explorer ads, you know, hazardous journey, low wages, safe return, doubtful fame and glory and cases, success. And I think that's a valuable lesson so many times we think we can win people over by offering them things. And there is definitely some merit to that, but it can also be an effective tactic to be demanding. There are a lot of leaders who will, you know, try and stay in power by being nice to you and, and hoping for reciprocity. It's so easy to find leaders like that. They're a dime a dozen it's much rarer to find a leader who you feel like will actually push you and lead you to do great things. A lot of times people will respect the leader who has high expectations, who pushes them, who challenges them.

A lot of times people will respect the leader who has high expectations , who pushes them , who challenges them . So Phillip is trying both approaches . Philip the Great: He's flattering, he's bribing, but he's also challenging and pushing. And as he's doing this, he's also training his army in the winter of 360. The army that would come to conquer the entire world starts to form. Phillip has two problems to solve. On the one hand, he's going to have to fight these barbarians. They're generally bigger and stronger and more fearsome individual fighters than Macedonians, but they don't tend to fight as cohesive units. So you can deal with them, but you have to be very disciplined about it. The bigger problem to solve is the Greek infantry. The hoplites, the hoplites were the greatest heavy infantry in the world, and it's not particularly close. The Greek hoplites were essentially a heavily armed Spearman. He would be wearing iron armor, including a breastplate, a helmet , uh, and grieves for the shins. They also carried around concave shield called the Aspice, which weighed about 15 pounds. Their primary weapon was the Doru. It was an eight to 10 foot sphere used. Hoplites also carried a short sword for very close combat. They carried the shield on the left arm and together with other hoplites around them, they would create a shield wall where, you know, they're shielded mostly protect themselves, but also a little bit to the guys, to the left and to the right of you hoplites were organized into groups called phalanx, which were eight to 10 rows deep , the back rows would place their shields on the backs of the soldiers in front of them and hold them in place. Meanwhile, the front ranks would push with their shields and also try to stab with their Spears as much as possible or stab with a short sword. If they were close, I have to do that at certain times. Commanders would give a command to take a step forward and then the back rows would push with their shields and the whole weight of the failings. These eight to 10 men would push on the enemy, moving them backwards. This was called the and according to many of ancient accounts, Greek armies would literally push each other off the battle. This is how one scholar described, uh, the method of ancient warfare. he says, quote, battles of the late archaic and classical periods tended to follow the same script. Armies would line up someone elected as general would give a rousing speech followed by the sacrifice of a goat or a sheep to gain favors with the gods. Then both armies would charge", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/philip-the-great", "title": "Philip the Great", "chunk_index": 8, "publication_date": "2021-07-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 36}}
{"text": "battles of the late archaic and classical periods tended to follow the same script . Armies would line up someone elected as general would give a rousing speech followed by the sacrifice of a goat or a sheep to gain favors with the gods . Then both armies would charge Philip the Great: each other. Then one phalanx would shove the other off the field. So Greek warfare was basically, you can think of it like a very stabby game of rugby. Um, I actually think if I remember correctly, there's a pretty good example of it in the movie, Troy , uh, where they do this, you know, they all yelled together, Ooh. And kind of push or their shields push each other off, off the battlefield. In terms of other soldiers, Greek armies would typically have limited skirmishers who would throw Spears before the phalanx rushed each other and engaged, and they would have some cavalry who protected the wings of their army. Greek armies were typically weak when it came to cavalry , uh, uh, which is not terribly surprising, right? Greece is Rocky country. It's very hilly, very mountainous. There aren't a lot of open fields or Plains, the type of ground that cavalry succeed on a mass add-on by comparison is much more open. And as a result, they had much better cavalry than the Greeks. So that was Phillip's one advantage, but his big disadvantage was that his inventory we're probably going to get smoked by these recop lights. So he needed to come up with a tactic that neutralized the opposing infantry, especially the Greek hoplites. And he can't just copy them because his infantry were not as well equipped as the Greeks hoplites were expected to furnish their own armor and weapons. And the average Macedonian soldier was not wealthy enough to afford the heavy armor of the hoplite But over the winter of 360 BC, Phillip trained his inventory in a new style of fighting , uh, something completely innovative that he kind of came up with himself. I'm sure he took inspiration from somewhere, but it's really not attested to, as a major fighting style before Philip came up with it, he issued his men with a new weapon along spear called a Syriza. The spear was 16 to 18 feet long and had a counterweight at the end. So Macedonian soldiers could have most of the length out in front of them. If you imagine this little counterweight right behind them so that they have a full 16 feet of spear poking out in front of them, they had a shield much smaller and lighter than the Greek aspects that was strapped to their upper left arm. Now think about this. If you're a Macedonian soldier and you face a hoplite one-on-one with your big two armed pike that you're heating", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/philip-the-great", "title": "Philip the Great", "chunk_index": 9, "publication_date": "2021-07-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 36}}

If you ' re a Macedonian soldier and you face a hoplite one - on - one with your big two armed pike that you ' re heating Philip the Great: around, right? He's going to run up to you. Knock aside your big pike and easily just come up and stab you with his shorter spear. But conversely, if you think about facing an entire formation of Macedonian soldiers with their services, it was eight soldiers deep, and the first five ranks could all wield their Spears out in front of the formation. The last three ranks would be resting and waiting and would have their Spears kind of tilted upwards to try and block any , uh, any arrows or Spears that might be thrown at them. But as you approach the Macedonians, you would literally have five ranks of Spears stabbing at you before you could get to them. Um, at least that was the idea, right? And remembered the Greek phalanx, mostly relied on this obese, most this great unified push to win their battles. But to do that, you need your frontline literally pressed up against the opposing frontline with your shields, essentially on them. Greeks, mostly fought each other. So they were usually shield to shield, trying to push each other off the battlefield. But the idea with the Syriza is that if we can deploy enough Spears, they'll never get close enough to be able to give us that big push. We'll just be stabbing them to death. Uh, Uh, now that sounds like a great strategy and practice, but these Syriza formations take incredible discipline. It's really easy to get tangled up with other Spears. So you need to walk in very strict, very tight formations turning or doing any maneuvers is extremely difficult and you don't have great protection against arrows and other missiles. So you need to hold your ground and not run when other people are throwing Spears at your so Philip spends all winter drilling and drilling his men until they're prepared to fight in these formations with their services. This is a huge military innovation, but it's also a huge risk. No one had really tried this. When the spring comes, you have this big buildup everyone's ready to charge in and, and take their piece of Macedonia. But the first thing Philip does is buy off the unions and the thracians they'd be back, but he needed time to deal with the Athenians. So Phillip essentially pays them a bribe and all of a sudden he has taken most of the barbarians off the table entirely.

Philip the Great: He's got a few disaffected Macedonians and a substantial force of Athenians. Now the Athenian we're primarily involved in Macedonia because they wanted to control a city called , which Mastodon also claimed to some sovereignty over. So Phillip publicly seeds, any claim over in pitless, which greatly reduces the Athenian commitment to this guy, Argus, like they have already committed to helping him. So they kind of give a half-hearted effort, but they're not really all in it because well, if Mastodon is not really even going to challenge our claim to pitless then who cares? Yeah. So our Gaius marches to the ancient capital of Macedonia, A city called a JIA JIA. I think I'm pronouncing that right. Um, but the Athenians mostly stay behind, right. They kind of split their forces and they send a little troop of advisors with him. I mean, it's a, it's a, it's a force. It's a, it's some soldiers, but not their full army. Um, Um, they're not abandoning him again. They're not really going out of their way to support this guy.

You know, maybe people think, Hey, this guy's got a shot, but the common folk want nothing to do with him either. Because at this point they liked Philip , uh, which I think is likely right. He's gone on this charm offensive or just because they thought our gay has chances were. When he realizes that the people are not going to rise up to support him. He tries to get out of Dodge. He tries to leave Massad on, but Philip chases him down with astonishing speed. He can't believe how quickly Phillip ch uh, catches up to him.

This rapid March would be something of a hallmark throughout his career. And it's one of the most obvious and most important connecting links of all these great conquerors and generals. There are different in many, many ways. Some were attacking general. Some were defensive generals, some relied on their artillery, like Napoleon some on their cavalry, like Alexander others' on their infantry, like Cesar, some were tall, some were short, some were white, some were black. They were different in a lot of different, different ways, but there is no such thing as a general, who's a slow marcher. They all have that in common. Every single one of them moves fast. Um, and I think the lesson of that , uh, or the takeaway there is, is pretty obvious. Um, and that's something I'm trying to remember and implement more. There are great generals who make lots of mistakes. But there is no such thing as a great general who moves slow. And I think that's true of entrepreneurs, of scientists, of artists. Um, you cannot be great and move slow. In the aftermath of his victory, Athens quickly makes peace with Philip since he had promised to keep his hands off of amphibious. So Phillip finally has an uneasy peace. There are no immediate threats to his kingdom. So hypothetically, he's got a moment to rest and relax, but the problem is that all the same powers are still waiting to pounce. All these tribal barbarians around Mastodon had been bribed to not attack, but that can only last for so long before they invade again and asked for more tribute. So the rather than rest on his laurels and see what comes his way, Phillip decides to go on the offensive first, this kind of king like figure this leader of the pony and tribes. Uh, Uh, he dies. So while they're disorganized Philip invades and installs his own puppet as leader of Pena the next year in 3 58, BC Phillip invades, Elyria, the Macedonians had typically been afraid of the Libyans and we're even more so now because , um, well the first part they're physically larger, they're more barbaric, which is to say less settled, more warlike and accustomed to combat , uh, uh, uh, uh, included more meat fish , uh, which tended to make the men bigger than the Macedonians especially the common Macedonians who mostly subsided on , um, wheat and bread. , uh,", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/philip-the-great", "title": "Philip the Great", "chunk_index": 12, "publication_date": "2021-07-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 36}}

Before the battle even began, they would beat their chest scream loudly and mountainous furious charge and scare off the opposing forces. And they were big scary guys as often worked. And we imagined, you know, this would have been particularly terrifying to the Macedonians who, , just a year before or two years before had uh, , uh, had seen their king and a third of their own. Massacred by these Olympians. So the Macedonians would have had this in their mind and they're thinking, man, do we really want to go fight these guys when we don't have to do we want to March into Elyria and take the fight to them. Um, but Phillip convinces them. He's trained them. He's disciplined them. He's installed them with this mindset that we can do this. So they March in, they have this grueling battle. It's not an easy battle by any stretch of imagination, but the Macedonians stay disciplined. They outlast the Allianz and end up winning, killing thousands of And it's this crushing victory. Total victory over the Leary ends. This is a big deal for Philip because Mastodon had actually been partially under Illyria and occupation. Mastodon could be divided into two areas, upper Macedonia and lower masses. Lower Macedonia were fertile lowlands. Uh, most people in lower Macedonia farmed and lived in villages, but then there was upper Macedonia. It was up in the mountainous hill regions up north. It was still more of a wild place. Most people did not farm, but were rather herdsman tending flocks of sheep and cattle. Their societies were still quite tribal and it was poor. Um, Um, if lower Macedonia was halfway between the civilized Greeks and the barbarians, then upper Macedonia was halfway between lower Macedonia and the barbarians, right? So it was just kind of a spectrum of barbarity and upper Macedonians were still a little bit more wild, a little bit different. And the Northern Macedonians had been under the domination of these other barbarians under the Olympians for quite some time, but with this victory now, all of Mastodon was under Phillip's control, wanting to make the victory permanent.

And he populates these cities , um, with some upper Macedonians from the Hills , uh, uh, makes them farmers and, and puts them in cities, but he also takes him lower Macedonians and has them settle in these cities. He also does , uh, kind of the inverse. He takes some of the nobility, some of the tribal leaders from upper Macedonia, and he brings them to Pella where his court is and makes them some of his chief officers and advisors. Um, Um, so this kind of ensures that he's kind of mixing up , uh, all of Macedonian society kind of homogenous. Um, Um, destroying these old villages, old bloodlines, he's moving people around. So they would all kind of be reliant on him. Now there's different power structures and all points to Pella. It all points to Philip. Um, and again, this is another hallmark of Phillip. He knew how to win wars. He was a great tactical battle leader, but perhaps even more impressively, he knew how to win the peace, so to speak. He knew how to create a new situation that wouldn't just go back to the way it was once he'd won the battle, but that would be permanently advantageous to him. so in just a couple of years, Phillip has secured his throne and his kingdom in 3 56 BC, we get the first hint that he might also have bigger ambition. He wants again, takes two new wives this time. They're from the two leading families of the two most prominent and important city states in the Greek region of vessels. This is interesting because all these marriages are meant as political arrangements. So these new wives show that he starting to shift the focus towards Greece. He's thinking about Northern Greece , uh, uh, and, and what he can do that. And then by 3 57, BC Philip takes his fifth wife. Olympias from Epirus. Uh, Uh, she was the daughter of one of the late Kings of one of the tribes there. Again, this is a nearby region that could be prone to rating Mastodon.

Most scholars, , reject this as probably a, you know, a romantic invention, but uh, , uh, who knows, I mean, it could be true. The marriage was certainly politically expedient, but that doesn't mean there wasn't also a romantic component. It doesn't mean that uh Olympias and Phillip weren't young, hot people. Um, Um, it certainly was, , a productive marriage, , as Olympias bore a son Alexander, just a year later in 3 56. um, But to go back to the military campaigns in early 3 57, BC, Phillip reneges on his promise to Athens to respect the independence of amphibious and declares war on the city , um, citing that the people there were quote ill, disposed toward him and offered many pretexts for war. Um, Um, I love that. In other words, you guys have given me so many good reasons to go to war with you guys. I'm not even going to list them all, you know? Um, so you, you can read between the lines there , uh, that maybe he couldn't quite think of one good reason. So he just said, you guys are so rotten. I don't even have to say, well, I'm going to war with you. And Fidelis was not particularly large or powerful in terms of their military, but they were a very important port for trading goods to, and from math. Um, Um, and not just mass it on, but thrice and other European regions as well. a number of wars had actually been fought over the city , uh, uh, for that reason to control the trade going in and out of there, including between Athens and Sparta. The fact that Phillip was willing to make this aggressive move reflected two facts, one that he was feeling much more powerful and secure. And second, that Athens is tied up fighting wars in Southern Greece, and he knew they wouldn't really be able to contest him, But even without a Fimian support, taking amphibious was a daunting task.

Um, but this never worked just because it had so many access points, Phillip, instead of trying to blockade it , uh, ops for an aggressive siege with numerous assaults and heavy use of CJ engines to break down the city walls, the citizens of amphibolous appeal to Athens to come save them. But the Athenians who, as I mentioned were already fighting in another war are unable to come and eventually Philip takes the city through sheer grit and slow, steady, determined. He brings the city into the Macedonian kingdom. And of course, once again, introduces Macedonian settlers to make sure that the city remains loyal to him. Hi, Later that same summer Phillip takes another coastal city. This one called no, He had actually been controlled by Athens. So at this point they officially declare war on Phillip, but because they're still involved in this other conflict, it's just an empty threat and they don't send any forces to actually deal with it. But late in the summer of 3 57, BC things start to get more serious with these marriages and vessels and taking these numerous cities, his neighbors start to realize that Phillip is serious about local expansion and control before you can imagine his neighbors and , uh, especially the Greeks kind of thinking, okay, look at this cute little novelty. Mastodon is throwing around their weight for once , uh, cute job, little Philip. Um, but after it, Phillip takes amphibious and piton up back-to-back it becomes less cute people start taking them seriously and not necessarily in a good way for Philip. Three Kings from three case ponia and Elyria form, a triple Alliance to attack Mastodon. And at the same time, the Athenians begin courting. A group of city states called the Chelsea DND league to help them actually launch an attack on Phillip. So it appears that Phillip has maybe overplayed his hand a little, he's got some extra territorial gains. Sure. But in many ways, he's back to where he was at square one. He is once again, surrounded by multiple enemies on every side who threatened overwhelm him. And this is what I love about Phillip. He always has the same response to these types of situations. He doesn't drop some grand campaign. He doesn't try to respond to all the threats at the same time. He doesn't make some big gesture.

He doesn ' t make some big gesture . He just starts quietly handling each Philip the Great: problem. One at a time, always being pragmatic. He makes concessions where he needs to, but he just solves the problems one at a time in the lowest drama way. In this instance, he does this by first, going to the Chelsea Dean league and saying, look, Athens, isn't actually going to be doing any fighting. They're otherwise preoccupied. So how about instead of us slugging it out, I'll just give you a couple of cities and we call it a day and they think this sounds pretty good. They get something for nothing. So they agree this frees up the rest of the army to March into Elyria and score a big victory against the Assyrians. and when the other two king see this, they think twice about this Alliance and the whole thing kind of fizzles. And just like that, Phillip quickly escapes the dire straits that he was in. The thing I think about when I see this is that problems compound, right? If you're starting a business and you have a cashflow problem, then that can cause a talent problem because you can't pay enough for the right employees. And that creates a product problem, which creates a marketing and sales problem, which reinforces the financial problem. And so on. Problems compound. I think we all realized that we've, you know, I at least have had that problem before things spinning out of control, right. Problems causing more problems. But I think what's important to realize is that the inverse is true. That solutions compound as well. In other words, if what started as a cashflow problem is now a talent and sales and marketing and operations problem and everything else, then solving just one of those things will also help alleviate all the other problems as well. And that's what Philip does so well. He doesn't get overwhelmed by his problems. He just tackles them one at a time, knowing that solving one problem will also help alleviate the others around this time. Phillip also receives a very convenient request from a city called dace. They are tired of being occupied by the thracians. So Phillip comes, kicks out the thracians settle some Macedonians and renames the city Philippi in honor of him. This is the city that the apostle Paul would write a letter to that would get immortalized in the Bible as Philippians for his next movie, 3 54 BC Phillip takes the city of Metheny.

They were another important port and another strong ally of Athens who wants again , is to preoccupied to Philip the Great: help. Philip does take the city, but it's very costly to him personally. Um, Um, he shot in the eye with an arrow and loses an eye. I should mention that Phillip was not a behind the scenes general, right? Like most Macedonian generals. He was actually in combat swinging his sword. He suffered numerous serious injuries throughout his military career, including a lost eye, broken ribs, a broken collarbone, and a spear through the leg. They gave him a permanent limp. so, so this, uh, This last I is just the first of what would be many, many injuries throughout his career. And uh, , uh, I kind of like to imagine him as this. Pirate like figure right walking around with a limp and one eye and all these broken bones, this tough grizzled guy, who'd actually seen wars actually kill people with his bare hands. As the kind of guy Philip was with the conquest of Metheny. Phillip was now the master of the entire coastline of what is now Northern Greece. The area was important because it had major silver, gold and iron mines. So he was still in his coffers on that and minting new coins, but also Greece had pretty extensive trade with Europe. At the time they traded with the Macedonians various Celtic tribes with the thracians, the Scythians maybe even some lower down Germanic tribes. And now most of that trade had to go through Macedonian controlled ports and Philip is able to levy some big taxes and all that trade to produce an enormous amount of income for him. This allows Phillip to professionalize the army and give them wages. So they no longer need to go home during the winter to tend to their farms. They can just drill and practice and improve all your. It also allows him to hire foreign mercenaries who can bolster his army, especially CJ engineers who can help him think of new ways to breach city defenses. In fact, he plows so much money back into his army that he basically collects no surplus. Um, it gets to the point that even though he's got all this new income, he's struggling to make payments on time to his soldiers. He was fond of telling a story about a time when he was wrestling a man, a foreigner named Minnie Gettys, um, , and some soldiers come to see him about their late wages.

And it tells you something about Macedonian culture that he told this story many times with pride. And I think that story is very emblematic of Phillip's personality in the land of the CHADS. He was the head, Chad, the chattiest of the Chad's, right? He's the alpha, the tallest, the smartest, the most handsome, the most charming. And he knows it. When you read them out, Philip, he just oozes this self-confidence , um, um, mostly in a good way. He doesn't really feel the need to punish his enemies super harshly. He's very polite. He's like um, , um, if you ever go to the gym and you ask the biggest guy there for help, how to use a machine or something. Just like you find some completely jacked guy who weighs 250 pounds, pure muscle, you can tell he just lives at the gym. That guy is actually almost always super polite and helpful to you because he's not threatened by you and amateur lifter. He's got nothing to prove. And Phillip is very much that way. He's so self confident that he is the smartest and the most charismatic man in the room that he's polite. He's social, he's forgiving, he's gracious. And he's funny. He doesn't feel the need to prove he's always the best. He honestly sounds like he just he'd be a great hang. um, , so in 3 54, BC, Phillip is 28. He's doubled the size of his kingdom. He's made Masad on insanely wealthy, seriously upgraded its army and taken it from a picked on and loaded backwater to one of the most dominant forces in the region. And he's got five wives and numerous children. So he's already accomplished a lot and things are looking good for him, but it's important to remember that at this point, Phil, it might be the master of the European region, just north of Greece, but he's still essentially a non entity in the Greek world.

Phillip was in on the Eastern border Philip the Great: of Macedonia in rather minor engagement. When he received word that war had broken out into messily 500 miles away on the Southwestern border of Macedonia. The conflict was between the city states of Larissa and FarEye Phillip had married a woman from each city state, but Larissa was a longer standing ally of mastodons and they appealed to Phillip for help. He agreed to support them, but there's an issue it's too far to March and make it in time to be of any help. So the logical thing to do is to sail his army to that. But Athens was allied with FarEye and Athens was still technically at war with Mastodon and the Athenian Navy had come up to block any possible sea route to the engine and this is one of those incidents where we see the true character of Phillip come out, because the easy thing to do would be to simply give up. It's not your territory. Anyway, it's just an ally. You can always say, you know, guys, I would have loved to have helped, but it just wasn't possible, but that's not what he does. It's just not in his nature to do that. Right. So he does something clever. He's got a very small Navy, just enough to guard his transport ships, to ferry his troops around. So he sends out his four fastest warships and moves all of his fastest rowers to those. , fill it, basically sends them out as bait. And once they're spotted by the Athenian Navy, they sail away as fast as possible. And the Athenians give chase, leaving the path clear for Philip and his men to sail right through on the transport ships. Unfortunately, once Philip does get to vessels, he soundly beaten twice. The army he's fighting is from a city state called , uh, uh, who were allies of fair eye. And they use a false retreat to lure Phillip's troops in and attack them with catapults , it's a moment of momentary danger for Philip it's his first major defeat, and he knows that he can't leave it unanswered. So in the next summer, in 3 52 BC Phillip returns to facily and this time with overwhelming force, he meets the same general who had defeated him the previous year.

It ' s a long story , but the whole conflict started over a city state that had supposedly illegally stolen sacred Philip the Great: funds from the temple of Apollo in Delphi. And so Phillip is supposedly fighting to avenge the honor of this temple of Apollo. Um, obviously there is a big component of , uh, trying to protect his power into vessels. Um, but there's this religious reason as well, and he never wants to pass up an opportunity for a good bit of propaganda. So he gives his men Laurel wreaths to wear over their helmets before this battle, Laurel wreath was a symbol of Apollo. So he's basically showing that he's this pious guy, a righteous Crusader. And um, , um, you know, according to the sources, this gave his men a lot of confidence going into the battles. One of the reasons that they won two are cynical, postmodern minds that might seem cheesy, right? Oh, are going to dress up like gods and that'll give our men confidence. But , um, you know, all the ancient sources think he was a brilliant move. So I think it's fair to say that , uh, it did give his men , um, some, some boost, some benefit. Of course, just because he's fighting on behalf of the gods that doesn't stop Phillip from uh, , uh, from wedding, his beak a little bit after the victory, he takes a few cities and vessels and incorporates them into his kingdom and his ecstatic allies from Larissa who are now the undisputed power and Thessaly declare him arc-on of vessels. And arc-on basically meant that he was technically be Supreme commander of armed forces and passively it's a pretty big deal. It now means that in this region of Greece, he can call on all their soldiers whenever he wants to come fight his wars. He also tries to move south to see if he can finish the war, but he's blocked at the pass of Thermopylae, which is a famously narrow pass in Greece. It's the place where , um, if you've seen the movie 300, it's where the 300 Spartans held off the entire Persian army. Phillip decides it's not worth the damage. His army would suffer to attack the pass. So he withdraws and the sacred war grinds on in decisively for the next six years. There's not a ton of that.

But there is a lot of attention on Massad on now because they are technically still the beating heart, the central player on one side of the sacred war. And Athens is the other, neither of these cities are the chief instigator of this third sacred war. That's the small city state of focus, but since they're the most powerful power on each side, they're honors at stake in the outcome, neither Mastodon nor Athens attack each other directly. During this time, they're kind of just circling each other to see what happens. The problem was that Athens didn't have the military power to March into Mastodon and attack. And Philip didn't have the Naval power to sail down to Athens and attack. So it was just a long ongoing study. Uh, , some of the Athenians don't take it all that seriously. They think it's fine that they're in the stalemate , uh, this kind of holding pattern and, and don't feel the need to actually attack Philip. Um, but there are others who are constantly agitating against him and, and want to attack him. They're led by the famous orator Demosthenes. He's, uh, He's known as one of the greatest speakers and statesmen of all time and the main topic of his activism was opposing Phillip. He believed that Philip had to be opposed. Absolutely. Uh, Uh, one such surviving quote , uh, uh, reads quote, men of Athens. I want you to know and realize the restless activity, which is ingrained in Phillip's nature. Seriously, is anyone here so foolish as not to see that our negligence we'll transfer the war from Chelsea east. By the way I pointed this out before , uh, uh, that the great ones all have this insane energy. And I love that. That's the one thing that Demosthenes calls out. I want you to know and realize the restless activity, which is ingrained in Phillip's nature. That's a great way to phrase it. These people are just always in motion and it's ingrained in their very nature. The Masa Annie's was a real pain for Philip. In many ways.

So he starts assembling his army to March south and defeat fossas, which again was the city that caused this whole sacred war by pillaging sacred funds from the temple of Apollo, the themselves get scared by this realize that the war unwinnable, there's no way they can stand up to fill up. So they elect a government that favors unconditional peace. They essentially surrender in order to secure a more favorable peace term. Once this happens, the citizens of Athens start asking themselves if this is really the hill they want to die on, do they really want to risk their next fighting Philip in a war where the people that they're supposedly fighting for have already surrendered Phillip himself starts to make some peace overtures by unilaterally releasing Athenian prisoners. So the Athenians take this opportunity to send 10 ambassadors to discuss peace terms. When they get there, they are surprised to see other ambassadors from all the major powers, Thebes, Sparta, Vasily, and others. It was a real sign of how far Phillip had come that his court was really the place to be for all of these ambassadors. From these major city states throughout Greece. I want to read Adrian Goldsworthy's account of Phillip's behavior towards these Athenian ambassadors, because I think it sheds a lot of light on his character. This is from the book Philip and Alexander , uh, which highly recommend by the way, he says, quote, the Athenians were received with great courtesy and entertained lavishly. All 10 had prepared speeches to be delivered in order of age and experience. And Phillip listened with patients to them, all, something that took at least several hours. One of them repeated the Athenian claim to amphibious DeMoss knees as the youngest and most junior spoke last, he was well known for the care with which he prepared and scripted. Any speech, not trusting himself to speak off the cuff, unless he could not avoid it. Others claimed Moston he's had a fit of nerves and after a bad start dried up altogether, Phillip is supposed to have shown sympathy, encouraging him to take his time and continue when he was. When they were summoned again, Phillip spoke graciously answering each argument in turn often naming the order. In question, the king concluded with warm expressions of Goodwill toward Athens. He agreed to send his own ambassadors to Athens, to continue negotiations. So there you can get a feel for kind of the polite nature of Phillip, right? He's very patient.

And Phillip, his patient says, Hey, you know, take your time, man. It's all right. You know, if you need a minute, you can have a minute finish your speech and DeMoss. And he's also said the king was praised for his looks, his drinking capacity and a memory, another ambassador named a ski NACE added that he was well-mannered generous and eloquent. They both agreed that he was clever and cunning. Phillip never passed up an opportunity to solve a conflict diplomatically. You could tell he loved campaigning. He loved war. He did love battle, but he also loved diplomacy and he preferred to solve conflicts, diplomatically whenever possible. Honestly many times so that he could use his army to take on an even bigger conflict with even more glory. But, but still he was a great diplomat. The Athenians agreed to a peace deal called the peace of Socrates that essentially confirmed things as they stood peace with no conditions, which was a pretty big concession from Athens because it meant Phillip got to hold on to Amtrak. That important port city near Macedonia, but it did come with a promise from Phillip that he would cease all aggression toward Athens and her allies with a piece of velocity signed to Philip March through Thermopylae occupied posis destroyed the city, resettled it citizens in smaller towns and impose a tax on them until they paid back the money they had taken from the temple of Apollo.

He has successfully portrayed himself as the defender of Apollo. And he's now known as a holy warrior, right? A pious man throughout all of Greece. And so at the end of this war in 3 46, BC, Phillip was, you could say the most powerful force in the Greek world at the age of only 40. He doesn't take a break to enjoy it, though.

This particular campaign is only notable because a blow from an Elyria and struck him and broke his collarbone. Also, during this time, there are low level conflicts between Athens and Macedonia. The piece of is still technically in effect, but you'll have situations where , um, let's say a democratic city state has a civil war and Macedonians pay mercenaries to fight on one side and Athens pays mercenaries to fight on the other. Yeah. Both hoping to install a government friendly to themselves. So, you know, there's some conflict involved, but no open war in 3 41 or three 40 BC peace finally completely breaks down between Athens and on it comes to a boil over a region called Eastern race. It was always an extremely sensitive area for the Athenians. If you look at a map of Turkey, we're talking about that little part of Turkey that is in Europe , uh, basically Athens imported, most of their wheat and a number of other raw materials from the black sea region. And so all those vital resources had to come through that narrow area where modern day Istanbul is at the time the city was called Byzantium and that little Strait was called the Hellespont and also through the Dardanelles, which is similarly a very narrow Strait leading to the black. If someone were to control either of these choke points, they could easily block all of Athens vital goods and essentially starved the city if they want to do Well, the trouble came in that this area was part of grace, as I said, and remember, the three nations were neighbors of Macedonia and the people that Philip had subdued and basically brought into his kingdom. So in 3 41, BC, you have a situation where Byzantium and some of her neighbors declare themselves opposed to Philip. So in three 40 BC, Phillip besieged as Byzantium and a nearby city called parentless, when he does this, the Athenian smashed the stone tablets, that the piece of velocities was inscribed on and declare war on him. The monster Denise was as happy as a pig. He was finally getting his wish and Athens was committing to war with Philip. Once again, the Macedonian sieges of Byzantium and parent, this end in face.

And once again, just kind of campaigns around in nearby regions securing his borders. He does. During this time, he receives a spear thrust that pierces his thigh, which nearly kills him and leaves Phillip with a permanent limp in 3 38, BC Phillip finally marches south into Greece. The proximate cause was involvement in another sacred war. The reasons for these squabbles are kind of unbelievable when you read about them, you know, you dedicated this trophy wrong saying that we were allied with the Persians in this war. When really they just sent us money to stay neutral, or, you know, you guys farm this land when it was supposed to belong to the temple of Apollo. I guess we better fight about it. But Phillip is marching against the city called Emflaza for one of these perceived slights against the. He wants again, it gets blocked near Thermopylae, the same path that is the gateway to Southern Greece. So he camps out for a few days then sends a message to one of his generals saying that war has broken out in three threes and he can't get past their mobily anyway. So he's going to pack up and go back home. He makes sure that the message gets intercepted by his enemies. And you get the impression that these Greek defenders at Thermopylae are not very bright because they read this and they say, okay, sounds legit. To me, checks out 100%. Let's all go home. And they immediately abandoned the past. So Philip easily marches through the past at Thermopylae, with little opposition, occupies emphasis and banishes. Those who offended the gods that basically settles the fourth sacred war. And what's even more important. He is now just a few days, marched from Athens. And obviously the citizens of Athens are panicked when word reaches them. That Phillip is so close. They closed the city gates call an emergency session of the assembly, start running around like a chicken with their heads cut off the whole nine yards. So Mastodon and Athens are sort of staring at each other, but neither of them is making a move. Um, because they're waiting on something they're both waiting to see what Thebes will do. Pheebs technically had been the ally of Mastodon. Um, but they didn't terribly want to see Mastodon just totally knockout Athens and become masters of all of Greece. Right?

Athens offers the foot, the entire bill for Naval operations, two thirds of the army operations and give Supreme command to the Thebans and to give them dominion over the ocean league, which was a very important collection of cities. Phillip is unable to match that offer. So the Thevenin army links up with the Athenian army and they both turned to face Philip Philip and the allied Athenian and Phoebe and armies dance around each other for awhile, each trying to initiate battle on ground that is more favorable to themselves. You can kind of feel the nerves of the generals involved as they seek each other out, trying to get better ground and not wanting to risk and engagement on anything less than perfect it's conditions. They finally ended up facing each other at the battle of Cara Neha. This is one of the most critical battles in history. The fate of Greece is going to be decided in a single day. And yet we know very little about the battle. We know that Philip had around 30,000 men and an additional 2000 cavalry. The allied military was probably a little larger with around 35,000. Including the elite 300 men of the Phoebe and sacred band. This was an elite force of warriors, the most fierce and notorious fighting force in all of Greece. At the time, some claimed that the sacred band was made up of 150 pairs of lovers who fought all the harder because they were fighting for their partner. Um, historians, I think mostly agree that this is probably untrue. I mean, if nothing else, logistically that's very difficult to pull off. Um, Um, it's probably a later Athenian invention, but the even band was extremely highly regarded as the most elite fighting force in Greece. We know that the allies chose a place that abutted a river on one side, probably with the idea that they were doing this so that Philip couldn't outflank them with his superior cavalry. Daya Dora says the Alexander commanded one flank of the army and Phillip commanded the other though. He doesn't say which in one tradition, the Macedonians are said to have conducted a false retreat and lured the allies into a less secure place.

However, it happened, the allied line was eventually broken. The soldiers fled and many were killed or captured about a thousand Athenians alone were killed in 2000 captured or about a third of their men and a similar results for the feed bins and other allies, DeMoss, the niece, who was a participant in the battle through aside his shield, which was embossed with gold lettering, spelling out good fortune and fled back to Athens. Oddly at the site at the battle of Caronia, there's a monument set up, not only to the victors, but also to the defeated. It has been suggested that it was set up as a monument to the sacred band who did not fleet, but rather stood and died to the man. And this story seems at least somewhat plausible as 255 corpses have been found beneath the monument, which is pretty close to the 300 men who were said to have composed the group. In any case, Philip had defeated the allied army of the Athenians and feed bins and was now for all intents and purposes, master of all of Greece. However, Philip was now on his way into a very interesting quagmire , um, um, invading Greece in three 50 BC. It was a little bit like invading Afghanistan today. It was completely ungovernable in a great way to lose blood and treasure. The Greeks were insanely independent. Their autonomy as city states was very important to them. It was sacred basically. And so if one city state rose up to dominate for awhile in Greece, most of the other city states would ally together to defeat them. This created a permanent state of stasis where no one could control Greece for long Athens would be powerful for one generation and then Biebs and then Sparta and then Corinth, and then back to Athens, back to Sparta. Uh, but always some grand Alliance would put that leading city, state bank place mere hours after the battle of Cabernet ended word reached Athens and Thebes of the defeat. And the citizens flew into productive panic and began fortifying their city walls by all appearances they'd have no trouble recruiting other city states into a grand Alliance that would defy the dominance. He would have to expend years, probably sieging, Athens and Thebes and fighting all these other enemies, just so that he could subdue Greece for a time.

Uh , , Phillip had a quote , he said I would rather be remembered as a good man for a long time than as a Philip the Great: master for a short time. . Yeah. But this is where Phillip shows his true genius. He doesn't declare himself king of all of Greece. Instead he calls all of the Greek city states together to a grand council at the city of Corinth there. He makes it proposal a grand league. The league of Corinth, all city states in Greece are to be free and allied with one another. They're not to attack each other, interfere with free navigation or attempt to control any other's internal affairs Mastodon was to be head of the league, but they would simply be first among equals. And then Philip gets up and pulls a Steve jobs. You can imagine the hush among the representatives as he lets them know, there is one more thing. He proposes that the first act of the league of Corinth be to declare war on the largest empire. A civilization, more ancient and much more prosperous than the Greeks, the Persian empire. Phillip explains that with him at their head, they will feel an army from every Greek city, 200,000 men strong, and they are going to smash the Persians, conquer their lands and make themselves richer than they had ever imagined the members of the league roar their approval. And the stage is set for one of the greatest military campaigns in all of history. By the way, you might be wondering what the pretext was for this invasion. Phillip says that it is to punish them for destroying Greek shrines during the invasion of 480 and 479 BC. And by the way, that is 150 years previously. It's a little bit like if president Biden of the USA proposed a war against England for the burning of the Capitol in the war of 18. It's a, It's kind of a flimsy justification. Everyone knows that the real justification is to unify all of these Greek city states into a larger purpose and bring home some treasure and bring home some glory in 337 BC. One of Phillip's head generals, Permian crosses into Asia minor, and the war with Persia is technically begun. This was an advanced guard to clear the way and fill plan to follow a year later with the full army. In the meantime, he needed to sort out the home front and make sure everything would be okay in his absence with all the wives that Philip had married over the years, he had actually never taken a bride from lower Macedonia, the core of his kingdom and his main power base.

So in 3 37 , BC , Phillip marries again , this time Philip the Great: to a girl named Cleopatra, which is a very common name at the time. And she belonged to an important aristocratic Macedonian family. She was the niece of adolescents and important noble. And though it was a diplomatically, very advantageous marriage. She was supposedly very beautiful as well. And some sources say that Phillip was quite smitten with it. the Macedonian nobility are thrilled at this turn of events and none more so than analysts who proposes a toast at the wedding. He says, may the gods bless this union with a legitimate heir to the Macedonian throne? And this is obviously a very explosive thing to say with Alexander sitting right there, Alexander stands up, throws his cup of Adelaide and says, are you calling me a bastard? Things look like they're going to come to violence. When Phillip stands up to intervene, he draws his sword, but he trips probably due to his bad leg and falls flat on his face. Alexander exclaims look, everyone. Here's the man who was preparing to cross from Europe to Asia, but he came out cross from one couch to another. So, you know , uh, this is humiliating to fill up. A really bad thing for Alexander to say, who knows how much, you know, alcohol was blowing through his blood at the time, probably at least a fair amount. Um, but this was a very stupid thing to say. Phillip explodes um, , um, comes after him. Luckily his friends and companions hold Phillip back long enough that um, , um, that Alexander can escape. And Alexander flees, not only the wedding, but Macedonia entirely he and his mother flee to appear us and take up residence with her family. It appears that this exact issue was something that Alexander was very concerned about. Adrian Goldsworthy described Alexander as impatient, quick tempered, determined and obsessively competitive. I think that's a good description. I would add very suspicious, very suspicious of other people. Many ancient writers, blame this on his mother, which seems possible. Um, but it's also possible that it was inherent to Alexander. Uh, Uh, he certainly displayed a good deal of suspicion even when he was apart from his mother, Alexander was a carbon copy of his father in many ways, a perfect little. But one big difference was that while Philip was confident and comfortable in his own skin, Alexander was more suspicious and paranoid.

Phillip had tried to assuage this fear for Alexander he ' d commissioned a monument for himself . And in this monument it Philip the Great: had a statue of himself and he was flanked by his parents on one side and Olympias and Alexander on the other, which clearly set out Alexander as his heir. Um, Um, he also, you know, Alexander was the second leading commander of his army, often leading the companion cavalry, the, the leading elite cavalry of, of their army. So, you know, Phillip was making every effort to assure Alexander, no, you are my air. Um, and even after this incident, Phillip is gracious and invites Alexander home. After a few months, he may or may not have personally really forgiven Alexander. There's no way to know, but in any case before he could leave for Asia in this invasion of Persia, he needed his air to be around. He needed to have a clear air in case he died on campaign complicating. Their relationship was the fact that Cleopatra this new wife of Philip was pregnant by the end of the year. And she would end up giving birth to a boy. Phillip could make every assurance that he wanted to Alexander. But the fact the matter was if the boy grew up and reached adulthood and was of sound, mind, and sound body, there was a good chance that he could contest Alexander for the throne. He was Macedonian on his father's side and his mother's side, very illustrious ancestry he'd have a power base because of his family that was related to Atlas. And so Alexander sees this and it's kind of understandable that he would feel some suspicion and some paranoia. Um, Um, we can tell that he was on edge because he unnecessarily upsets his father. Once again, Phillip was arranging a marriage between an Anatolian king and Alexander's older brother, the disabled era Deus. And Airedale, you don't hear about him because , um, we don't know exactly what was wrong with him, but it appears that he had some mental disability and they were quite kind to him. They just, you know, kept him out of the limelight. So he was around, but not anyone important. And , uh, but Alexander sees every day, us getting married to this princess and he gets jealous and sends his own Envoy to this Anatolian king. It says what you want to marry.

Army Alexander and a word gets back to Phillip who is livid . Once again , understandably , Philip the Great: his own son is interfering in foreign affairs. Phillip calls off the original marriage and gives Alexander talking to it and basically says, what are you doing, man? You're my air. You're going to marry someone really important someday, some Macedonian princess or some Greek or Persian, noble, not the daughter of some insignificant king in the middle of nowhere. Alexander is appropriately chastised and Phillip banishes, a few of Alexander's close friends who he thought that had kind of, you know, egged him on. And once again, confirms Alexander status as heir to the Macedonian throne. So 3 36 BC is the pinnacle year of Phillip's achievement. He's going to see his daughter married and a confusingly. His daughter's name is Cleopatra. Okay. Not his wife Cleopatra, but he also has a daughter named Cleopatra and she is going to marry the king of appear us. Whose name is Alexander again, not his son Alexander, but technically his brother-in-law Alexander. Um, so this marriage in part is kind of an olive leaf to Alexander and his mother Olympias because he's marrying one of his daughters to basically someone from Olympia says family. So this is kind of cementing their place in court with Phillip. And so he's going to make. A really big deal, right? It's not just a wedding. It's his last major public event before he goes off to war to conquer Persia. So it's going to be the big thing. He makes a big festival of it. There's going to be theater. There's going to be games. There are going to be , uh, uh, athletic competitions, everything. Um, Um, before this all happens, he goes to the Oracle of Delphi and asks if the omens are good for his invasion of Persia, the Oracle replies wreath is the bowl. All is done. There is also the one who will smite him. And Phillip feels comforted thinking that the king of Persia is the bowl and he is the one who will smite him. Uh, Uh, the last thing is, is the wedding. Now I need to give a little background before the wedding and I've got to issue my first ever content warning for what comes next.

So , uh, uh, background , uh, king, Phillip had very few body guards and this was a point of, of pride for him, right? He was a man of the people, unlike the king of Persia who always had this big retinue. Philip was a man. Right. And he could protect himself. So he only needed these few seven body guards to help protect him. One of these body guards was a man named a young man, a Pomeranian had a really strange story. , so another young man named , right. I told you the stories would be confusing, but stick with me. So , uh, this other young man named posy, Aeneas had been the lover of Philip and we'll call him Pasina this one in Hellenistic world. It was very common for older men to take adolescents as lovers. Um, so yeah, sorry. This whole time Phillip was a pedophile. So it was everyone in Greek society. Uh, Uh, that's just, that was very common for at the time. No one would have thought that this was wrong or looked at it askance. Um, but however, as is one aged out of his boyish good looks and into adulthood, Philip lost interest as was normal. Uh, Uh, it was not normal for adult men to have a sexual relationship. It was just viewed as something that was appropriate between an older man and a younger boy. Um, Um, so Phillip loses interest in posse Aeneas one and instead took up an affair with another young man , um, who we will call Aeneas number two. Um, so Pasina is one took offense to this and insulted posse Aeneas number two, saying that he was a slut and as much a woman as a man, the second posse Aeneas was very much grieved by these insults. Uh, they were being whispered around court and decided to prove his Manliness by throwing himself into the most dangerous part of a battle where he was killed , um, thereby proving in death that he was a man. And uh, , uh, and that these insults that were being said about him were not true. Adolescents, a powerful Macedonian nobleman was a friend of the dead person. And heard his plan.

Adults made no attempt to conceal that it was he who had done this. And in fact, fired the flames. Right? He was spreading the rumors because he was so mad at this posse Aeneas. And so he was letting everyone know that this young, the man had, had been abused and raped. Yeah. Pacino is one complained of this to Philip , um, and wanted redress. But Phillip was about to leave on campaign. He could not risk offending, one of his most important and powerful Nobles. So he tried to mollify the boy by expressing his sympathy and promoting him to the position of oil body guard. But the boy's feelings were not assuaged. He stood right. And soon his anger turned toward Phillip soon. He made a plot to get his revenge. Yeah. As Philip entered the theater during his moment of triumph , uh, during these opening ceremonies to this wedding, pacinian quickly ran up to him, thrust a dagger between his ribs and then ran off Philip's heart was pierced and he died within just a couple of minutes. Three other body guards caught up to POS Aeneas. As he ran and quickly killed him. Of course, suspicion would soon turn to Alexander and his mother Olympias. He stood the most to gain from Phillip's death. He would now be king is, would be rivals, were dead within a fortnight. And Alexander would be able to prosecute Phillip's glorious conquest of Persia himself. It's possible that Alexander recruited or perhaps just fueled the flames and talked to him and got him a little more riled up and angry at Phillip it's also was just a jilted lover who was angry at horrible abuse and killed Phillip for his own reasons. Um, you know, we'll never know when Phillip lay dying. It was Alexander, who was by his side, who looked into his face as Philip drew his last breaths. And I can't help, but wonder what Phillips saw when he looked into Alexander's eyes, where they, the still silent eyes of someone who held a great secret or were they the eyes of someone who was an aggrieved son who couldn't believe that he was watching his father die in his own hands?

{"text": "Julius Caesar (Part 4): Caesar Part 4 Script Hello and welcome back to How to Take Over the world. This is part 4 of the life of Julius Caesar. Before we get started, I want to mention again that if you have any feedback or questions, don‚Äôt hesitate to email me at Ben@HTTOTW.com. I‚Äôll give you a quick recap of where we are at: Julius Caesar has conquered all of Gaul, which corresponds roughly to modern day France, and brought it under Roman rule. This was a major accomplishment and provided a huge new source of income to Rome. But when he gets ready to come home he finds that the Senate is anything but grateful. He was bitterly opposed by a group of senators called the optimates. The optimates were those senators who favored more power for the Roman senate and the Roman upper-classes. They hated Caesar, because he was a very powerful populist. He sought power by currying favor with the common people and middle class. The optimates held more power in the senate, so instead of preparing to treat him like the conquering hero that he was, the senate abused his supporters in government, stripped them of their power, threatened to prosecute Caesar, and treated him like an enemy of the state. They anticipate civil war, and for that reason they bring Pompey to Rome and give him command of all the Roman troops who were not directly under the command of Caesar. As a reminder, Pompey was the other great Roman general of the time. In fact he was considered by almost everyone to be a superior general to Caesar. The two had previously been close, and Pompey had even married Caesar‚Äôs daughter, but they had recently grown more distant, in part because Caesar‚Äôs daughter Julia had died in childbirth. Caesar tried to reach out and come to a peaceful resolution to the crisis, but in the end was not able to do so, mostly because the optimates in the senate were not willing to compromise. They had more men, they had Pompey, and they had Rome, so they didn‚Äôt think Caesar was a serious threat. So why compromise? Caesar always had a knack for doing the unexpected and knocking his opponents off balance. In this case, everyone expected him to sit back and try to defend himself in Gaul. So instead, he takes the few troops he has with him and blitzes into Italy. You‚Äôll remember that we left off with Julius Caesar crossing the Rubicon River and taking his first fateful steps on his march to Rome.

{"text": ", he takes the few troops he has with him and blitzes into Italy . You ‚Äô ll remember that we left off with Julius Caesar crossing the Rubicon River and taking his first fateful steps on his march to Rome . As his single legion marches with him into Julius Caesar (Part 4): Italy they start taking town after town. This has a few effects. One is that it throws Rome into a panic. All the senators who had opposed him start running for the hills. Pompey has been given command of hundreds of thousands of soldiers, but for the most part they are located in the provinces: Spain, Greece, Asia, Syria, Africa, everywhere but Rome. So Pompey and his supporters realize they have to get out of Italy before Caesar gets to them and ends the war before it even begins. Some of Pompey‚Äôs supporters, they‚Äôre called Pompeiians, argued they had to stay and fight. It would be a total disaster to evacuate Italy. I mean think about it, just a couple weeks before everyone is talking about how Caesar is this upstart rebel and Pompey is going to crush him. Now they are talking about ceding all of Italy to him. But Pompey knows there is no way he can fight Caesar so he takes his few troops and all his supporters in the senate and marches toward the coast. He wants to sail to Greece where he can meet up with some more legions who are loyal to him and the senate. Caesar and Pompey both race to the port that Pompey wants to disembark from; Pompey makes it there first and is able to take off before Caesar can crush his small army. So, Pompey has escaped and will live to fight another day, but this is a major reversal for his cause. We have discussed how much PR matters in war previously in this podcast. Well for Caesar this is a huge PR success. Now instead of seeming like the rebel, in many ways he seems like the legitimate ruler of Rome. If two different people were claiming to be president of the United States, one of the first questions you might ask is, ‚ÄúWell who sleeps in the White House?‚Äù And Caesar has changed the answer to that question almost overnight. Now he‚Äôs the one who sleeps in the White House, so to speak, because he is the one actually in Rome. When Pompey takes his men to Greece, he basically takes all the military ships in Italy with him, so Caesar can‚Äôt follow. So instead of waiting around in Italy and building up his fleet, Caesar does something else unexpected. He marches his men to Spain and attacks the largest contingent of Pompeiian troops, which was located there. Once in Spain, the war takes on an interesting form.

Remember Romans were really good at building defensive fortifications , so both armies are quickly marching around each other trying to Julius Caesar (Part 4): get the best position from which to defend. But it was extremely difficult to out-march Caesar, he always managed to move his troops extremely quickly. So eventually he manages to corner the enemy army. Pompey‚Äôs army was the larger of the two, so it wouldn‚Äôt be totally hopeless to attack Caesar, but Caesar now had the better ground and had cut off the Pompeiian army from their supplies. Now what happens next is shocking, and to understand it we have to back track a little. Caesar hadn‚Äôt fought any big battles yet in this Civil War. But as he marched through Italy, he had had carried out some minor sieges. When he eventually won those sieges and overcame the city, he always did the same thing. He showed extreme clemency. He didn‚Äôt execute or imprison anyone, even if they were a relatively important member of the opposition. He simply freed the soldiers and the commanders and said ‚ÄúYou are free to do what you will. Follow your conscience.‚Äù And many of those people that he released joined up with Pompey as soon as possible and continued to fight against Caesar. But this was excellent psychological warfare. He made himself seem like a statesman, rather than a rebel, as well as a friend to common soldiers. He made it very tempting to capitulate rather than fight him. So Caesar and his enemies settle into this stalemate with opposing camps very close to each other. And since there is no fighting for a couple days, the soldiers on both sides start to wander into each other‚Äôs camps. They are all Romans and you would have many situations where men from the same home town who knew each other would be in opposing armies, so they are crossing back and forth and talking. And the Pompeiian soldiers are asking, ‚ÄúSo what do you think of this Caesar guy who you‚Äôre fighting for?‚Äù. And of course, Caesar was very popular with his troops so they are saying ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs awesome. We love him. He pays us really well and he really cares about the soldiers. In fact, he pardons every Roman soldier who he captures.‚Äù So the Pompeiian soldiers start becoming reluctant to fight. Caesar sounds like a cool guy, they are in a bad position strategically, and they know if they just surrender, they are going to be spared, whereas if they fight they might very well die in battle.

Caesar is encouraging this cross - talk , but one of the Pompeiian commanders sees what is going on and is dismayed . He drives Julius Caesar (Part 4): Caesar‚Äôs men out of his camp, ordering his body guards to kill any of the opposing soldiers that they find. This backfires spectacularly. In a display of soldierly comradery, the common soldiers hide Caesar‚Äôs men in their tents, so they can‚Äôt be caught and killed. Over the course of a couple days, this defiance morphs into outright mutiny. The army pressures its commanders to surrender to Caesar, and they do, ending the action in Spain without a major battle ever being fought. Caesar disbands the opposing army, and many of the soldiers decide to join him. In his commentaries, Caesar says, and remember, he refers to himself in the third person, ‚ÄúCongratulations and joy were everywhere, on one side for having escaped from such an enormously perilous situation, and on the other for having achieved such great success without shedding any blood. In everyone‚Äôs opinion Caesar was getting a huge return from the leniency he had shown[‚Ä¶] and his strategy was now praised by everyone.‚Äù His clemency and popularity paid off big time. He has not only defeated his opponents‚Äô largest army with no losses, he has in fact added even more soldiers to his army. However, Pompey is also growing stronger by the day. He has met up with his troops in Greece, he‚Äôs adding to them Roman soldiers from Syria and Asia, as well as forces loaned from Roman allies in nearby regions. By the time Caesar returns from Spain, Pompey has built a larger army than Caesar‚Äôs, even taking into account the soldiers Caesar has just added. Additionally, he still controls the vast majority of naval vessels in the area, giving him a significant tactical advantage. Caesar returns to Rome with his army and takes a few days to organize things politically in the capital. Shortly thereafter, and you‚Äôre not going to believe this, he decides on an unexpected action designed to keep his enemies off balance. He decides to cross the Adriatic and attack Pompey in Greece. No one was expecting this for four reasons: First, it was January and campaigning in winter was difficult because it was cold and there wasn‚Äôt a lot of grain to supply troops with. Second, Caesar had built up his navy a little bit, but Pompey still had way more ships, so if he tried to cross there was always the risk that he would be defeated in a naval battle and his army would drown at sea before they could even fight.

{"text": "so if he tried to cross there was always the risk that he would be defeated in a naval battle and his army would drown at sea before they could even fight . Third , Caesar ‚Äô s navy was only big enough to transport about a third of his Julius Caesar (Part 4): army, so it would take multiple trips to get them all across the Adriatic Sea to Greece. Fourth, even if he accomplished all of this and somehow managed to get his entire army across the Adriatic Sea and managed to find a way to keep them provisioned, he would be attacking a larger army commanded by Pompey, then considered to be one of the greatest generals of all time. But these were all the same reasons that Caesar did decide on an attack. His naval prospects were not going to increase in the immediate future and Pompey‚Äôs army was growing stronger in the meantime, so his choices were to either utilize the element of surprise and get as much of his army across as possible and hope for the best, or wait in Italy until Pompey gathered enough strength that he felt comfortable attacking. So Caesar rolled the dice. Taking advantage of his enemies‚Äô inattentiveness, Caesar is able to sneak the first third of his army across the sea without confronting Pompey‚Äôs navy. After that he is blockaded, and unable to unify his army for a few months. Eventually, however, through both persistence and luck, he is able to transfer the entirety of his army across the Adriatic sea to Greece. Caesar marches his troops to the port town where Pompey has his troops stationed, and there he waits. He waits for a long time. Neither side will attack, because they are evenly matched enough that both fear attacking will put them at a disadvantage. Caesar comes up with a new strategy. He besieges Pompey. You‚Äôll remember that the Roman soldiers are these great construction workers. So they build walls and trenches around Pompey‚Äôs army in this port town. This is somewhat ludicrous, as Pompey has a slightly larger army, and a much larger navy, with which he could sail his army around the ‚Äúsiege‚Äù at any moment. The main reason Caesar carries out this siege is not for any real tactical advantage, but as a PR move. He‚Äôs trying to collect friends and allies, and now the story he can sell is that he beat Pompey in Spain and Italy, and now has him besieged in Greece. It is a shrewd and effective tactic. During this time, Pompey is able to sail in supplies while Caesar is not. Remember, one of the reasons that people didn‚Äôt campaign during the winter was that there weren‚Äôt enough food supplies. Caesar and his men survive only by talking to the locals and discovering that there is a local root plant that can be made into a disgusting but hearty bread.

Caesar and his men survive only by talking to the locals and discovering that there is a local root plant that can be made into a disgusting but hearty bread . You would Julius Caesar (Part 4): think this would demoralize the troops, but Caesar manages to turn it into a motivator. It sort of turns into a sign of their toughness and ingenuity. They heave loaves of it into Pompey‚Äôs camp to prove they aren‚Äôt starving and that they aren‚Äôt going anywhere. When Pompey himself tries the stuff he remarks that they aren‚Äôt fighting men but beasts, since only an animal could live off that kind of food. The siege eventually comes to an end when two of Caesar‚Äôs commanders from Gaul betray him. They had been skimming money off their soldiers‚Äô pay and were found out and reported to Caesar. Rather than face the inevitable punishment, they defect to Pompey. They tell Pompey about a serious weakness in Caesar‚Äôs fortifications and Pompey pounces. He attacks Caesar‚Äôs weak spot and scores a major victory. He kills nearly a thousand men. And yes, that is less than 5% of Caesar‚Äôs army but keep in mind that that is more men than Caesar lost in any battle in Gaul or any battle he had fought anywhere up to that point in his life. Casualties were hard to come by in a time period when you had to hack or stab someone to death, and 1,000 casualties was a big deal. Caesar is forced to abandon his siege and retreat with his battered army. With this victory, the Pompeiians are ecstatic. They believed all along that Pompey was the superior general to Caesar. This just confirms it in their minds. They are so sure of their victory that they start making plans for when they get back to Rome. The senators in Pompey‚Äôs camp are so sure of victory, that they actually start to fight amongst themselves about who will take what positions in the new government after the war. But despite their assurance that victory is near, Caesar is not too panicked. He thinks okay I got in a bad situation and lost one battle. I‚Äôm fine. Here is how he describes what happened in his commentaries. This comes from a new translation by Kurt Raaflaub and by the way I highly recommend it. Caesar says: ‚ÄúThese accomplishments increased the spirit and confidence of the Pompeians to such an extent that they were no longer thinking of how to win the war but instead were presuming that they had won already. They did not pause to consider significant factors, such as the numerical inferiority of our troops [or] the treacherous battleground(‚Ä¶) nor did they bear in mind the dynamics that commonly affect warfare: how tiny causes such as an error in assumptions,", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/julius-caesar-part-4", "title": "Julius Caesar (Part 4)", "chunk_index": 5, "publication_date": "2018-06-05", "total_chunks_in_doc": 17}}
{"text": ". They did not pause to consider significant factors , such as the numerical inferiority of our troops [ or ] the treacherous battleground ( ‚Ä¶ ) nor did they bear in mind the dynamics that commonly affect warfare : how tiny causes such as an error in assumptions , Julius Caesar (Part 4): sudden fear, or religious concern have often resulted in major disasters, or how often as well, when a failure occurred in an army, the cause was a mistake by the commander or the fault of a tribune. The Pompeians, on the contrary, behaved as if their virtue had gained them this victory and no reversal could possibly happen: they jubilantly announced all over the world, through letters and word of mouth, the news of that day‚Äôs victory.‚Äù Caesar is making a crucial point. The Pompeians are chalking up their recent victory up to the superiority of their commander and army. But Caesar is saying they got a tiny advantage and scored a victory off it, but it doesn‚Äôt mean that much. They are getting ahead of themselves. Here is how Caesar handles the situation. This is again from the Kurt Raaflaub translation of Caesar‚Äôs commentaries: ‚ÄúCaesar was now forced to abandon his previous plans and believed that he needed to change his entire strategy for this war. Accordingly, he simultaneously withdrew his troops from all their fortified positions, thus ending the siege. He gathered his entire army in one place and addressed the troops in assembly, urging them not to be discouraged by what had happened: they should neither be frightened by their present experience nor consider this single setback ‚Äì which, at any rate, was relatively minor ‚Äì as equivalent to their many successful battles. They should be grateful to Fortune that they had captured Italy without suffering some losses; and that they had pacified the two provinces of Spain, homes of superbly fierce fighters, by defeating greatly experienced and practiced generals... Finally, they should recall their great good luck when they all had been transported unharmed straight through the enemy fleets.‚Äù If not all things turned out to be successful, they ought to come to Fortune‚Äôs aid with their own efforts‚Ä¶ whether it was their own confusion, or some error, or even that Fortune had intervened to take away [their] victory[‚Ä¶], they all should now devote themselves to overcoming with their bravery the damage that had been suffered. If this was done, it would certainly happen that this reversal would turn into a gain ‚Äì as had been the case at Gergovia ‚Äì and that those who earlier had been afraid to fight would of their own accord offer themselves for a battle.‚Äù Okay so Caesar makes some really great points. And he brings up their experience in Gaul where he was defeated at Gergovia only to achieve the defining victory of the war immediately thereafter at Alesia.

And he brings up their experience in Gaul where he was defeated at Gergovia only to achieve the defining victory of the war immediately thereafter at Alesia . It must have been very reassuring to his Julius Caesar (Part 4): soldiers to remember that they had been in a similar situation previously and it had ended in victory. And he was right that after this victory the Pompeiians would finally be willing to fight them in an even battle. Caesar retreats a little way to get more supplies, and they sack a few lightly guarded enemy-held towns, which is good for morale because it gives his men a few cheap victories and restores the confidence of some of the greener troops. Soon enough the Pompeiians catch up with Caesar, and the armies prepare to do battle near a Greek town called Pharsalus. The armies line up and the Pompeiians outnumber Caesar‚Äôs troops almost 2 to 1 at this point. Since Caesar‚Äôs legions are more experienced, it‚Äôs considered to be a draw in terms of infantry, but Pompey has a huge advantage in cavalry. Pompey develops a plan that his infantry will wait for Caesar‚Äôs to attack, and then defend and hold them in place while his cavalry go around Caesar‚Äôs right flank, defeat Caesar‚Äôs cavalry, and then proceed to attack Caesar‚Äôs infantry from the side and back. Caesar sniffs out this strategy, so he comes up with a counterplan. He takes his very best soldiers and forms a secret reserve behind his main forces. These guys are like the Navy SEALs of the Roman army. When Pompey attacks with his cavalry, Caesar will have his cavalry pull back, and then have this secret reserve attack and defeat the Pompeiian cavalry. This is exactly how the battle plays out, and Pompey‚Äôs army is dismayed to see that the attack that was supposed to win them the battle is completely foiled. Not only that, but Caesar‚Äôs secret elite reserve proceeds to attack the now exposed flank of the Pompeiian army. This quickly sends the Pompeiians running for their lives. Pompey himself flees the battle. At the end of the day, Pompey has suffered 15,000 men dead and 20,000 captured compared to Caesar‚Äôs 200 dead. Pompey‚Äôs army is completely destroyed. This was the most spectacular victory of Caesar‚Äôs career, and it is worth taking a moment to dissect how he did it. We see this interesting pattern again and again in Caesar‚Äôs career where his greatest victories come immediately after significant defeats. There is a quote from Winston Churchill ‚ÄúSuccess is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.‚Äù And I think that gets at the genius of Caesar.

He had grit and perseverance . He didn ‚Äô t take victories for granted , and Julius Caesar (Part 4): he kept calm in the face of defeat. It‚Äôs so easy to lose your head after a defeat. That‚Äôs why even an experienced general like Pompey did it. He should have stayed with his men, organized a retreat, kept together what he could, and fought on like Caesar just had. Instead he gave up and ran away. We all like to think we would act like Caesar, but as Mike Tyson so poetically put it, ‚Äúeveryone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.‚Äù There is actually a second half, he said ‚Äúthen, like a rat, they stop in fear and freeze.‚Äù Not freezing but instead keeping a cool head and regrouping must be a really tough skill. Pompey was one of the great generals of his age, someone who won multiple wars in spectacular fashion and really was pretty evenly matched when he went head to head with Caesar, and even he couldn‚Äôt keep his head after getting punched in the mouth. So how do we do it? There is a lot to be said on the subject, and I‚Äôm not sure I have a really great answer, but I will just point out one thing. And that is that Caesar kind of did lose his head the first time he got punched in the mouth. When he lost at Gergovia in Gaul, he made a number of mistakes. Luckily for him, his opponents became over-confident and made even worse errors, which allowed him to regroup and regain victory at Alesia, but he kind of lost his cool for a while. I think no matter how well you prepare, the first time you experience a major failure, it is going to be a major shock and you are probably going to freeze or in some other way respond poorly. One of the best things you can do is get used to failure and learn how to respond by experience. If you do this in a low stakes environment, you will be better prepared to handle failure in a high stakes environment. One way to do this is with a failure goal. I learned about this when I was doing door-to-door work. Anyone who has worked in sales knows that rejection is a part of life that you try to get used to, but never fully do. But by actually setting a goal for how many times you will get rejected, you flip your psychology and instead of avoiding failure, you seek it out.

If you are doing door - to - door sales you might set a goal of getting rejected 200 times in a Julius Caesar (Part 4): day. Of course, you don‚Äôt really want to fail, you‚Äôd rather that every time you made a sales-call it turned out successfully, but the exercise helps you get the courage to put yourself out there more, and also gives you more experience dealing with failure. That experience can help you deal with failure more effectively when you confront it in a high-stakes environment. The fact that Caesar had previously had the experience of dealing with a significant failure in Gaul and coming back from it, allowed him to do so again and in an even more effective manner against Pompey. Well, as I said, after the battle Pompey flees. He is without an army, and he becomes a refugee on the run. Caesar starts chasing him across the Eastern Mediterranean until Pompey gets to the city of Alexandria in Egypt. The local rulers there welcome Pompey and offer him shelter but the second he gets ashore they kill him. They saw that Caesar was winning and they wanted to score some points with the man who was surely soon to be the undisputed ruler of Rome, so they kill Pompey and present Caesar with his head. But Caesar is actually very upset. He didn‚Äôt want to kill Pompey, he wanted to keep him alive in order to be acknowledged by him. That would convey much more legitimacy and prestige back in Rome. Additionally, Caesar never had personal antipathy for Pompey. He always liked him and believed that they could work out their differences if they could just sit down and talk it out. The Alexandrians deprived him of that opportunity. With Pompey‚Äôs death, the war doesn‚Äôt completely end, some of his generals hold out in Africa and Spain, but the nature of it completely changes. Previously, most people really thought Pompey represented the legitimate Roman government and Caesar was the insurgent. Now, Caesar took his place as the ruler of Rome, and Pompey‚Äôs hold-out generals were the undisputed rebels. Caesar does not immediately leave Egypt. For a number of reasons, not least of which because he is mad at the ruling family for killing Pompey, he decides to start a war in Egypt to replace the ruling king. The woman he supports is the king‚Äôs sister, a woman by the name of Cleopatra.

Immediately after winning the war in Egypt , before returning to Rome , Caesar travells up the coast of the Eastern Mediterranean , settling affairs there and putting Julius Caesar (Part 4): down rebellions started by rulers who had tried to take advantage of the chaos of the Roman civil war and declare independence. After putting down the most significant of these rebellions in quick and decisive fashion, Caesar wrote back his shortest and most famous war report: ‚ÄúVeni. Vidi. Vici.‚Äù I came. I saw. I conquered. I‚Äôm going to take a cue from Caesar and be similarly brief in my description of the end of the civil war. Caesar returned to Italy where he gave up his dictatorship, was elected consul, and settled many of the affairs of government. As he did this, there was still a cloud hanging over his rule. Some of Pompey‚Äôs most ardent supporters were still refusing to give in and gathering strength in Africa, in the area that is modern day Tunisia. They had a relatively impressive army and were already launching raids on Sicily and Sardinia. Caesar needed to deal with this rebellion before it metastasized and became even more dangerous. I won‚Äôt spend much time on the African campaign because by this point it will be so repetitive. Caesar had a very distinct style. Listen to this description of the African campaign: He launched off with the troops he had before his army was fully ready, carried out an aggressive and highly mobile campaign, suffered a minor defeat after which he kept a cool head and successfully regrouped his men, and then finished with a crushing decisive victory. It sounds exactly his wars in Greece and Gaul, right? A few enemy commanders escaped to Spain, but for the moment, victory was complete. Caesar returned back to Rome shortly before his 54 th birthday, in 46 BC. When he returned from Africa, Caesar was given the greatest celebration in Roman history. If you can remember way back to the first episode in this series about Caesar, he had to choose between standing for election as consul and celebrating a triumph. A triumph was the literal crowning achievement for any Roman, the most glorious honor you could receive. The whole city was shut down and a celebration was held in your honor. You marched through the streets, showing off the spoils of war you had accumulated in your travels. Now Caesar was to receive a triumph celebrating his victories in Gaul, Egypt, Asia Minor, and Africa. He made a big deal of the fact that he was a world conqueror, having achieved major victories on all three continents.

{"text": "the fact that he was a world conqueror , having achieved major victories on all three continents . Caesar rode in a chariot drawn by white horses , behind him was a seemingly endless caravan of carts and wagons overflowing with gold and silver . These were then followed by Julius Caesar (Part 4): famous captives and slaves, such as Vercingetorix. Caesar‚Äôs victorious soldiers were also allowed to march in the procession, to receive their share of the glory and sing inappropriate songs about their commander. The triumphal parade was followed by banquets, feasts, and gladiatorial games for days on end. Once the celebrating was over, Caesar was named dictator for the space of 10 years. Dictator did not then have the same negative connotation that it does today. Dictator was a legitimate role in the Roman government. It was a temporary appointment that was only supposed to be used in cases of extreme emergency when Rome itself was under threat. A dictator was typically appointed for one year or at most two, and the fact that Caesar was going to be named dictator for ten years evidenced that this was not an emergency appointment, but a fundamental shift in the balance of power of Roman government. However, Caesar did not dismiss the senate, and still relied on the various branches of Roman government to carry out their functions, at least in form. In other ways, Caesar was building himself up as a larger-than-life figure. A statue was built of him straddling the world, and he offered pronouncements such as ‚ÄúMen ought to speak to me more courteously and treat my word as law.‚Äù He used this newfound power to enact a number of revolutionary reforms. He conducted a census of the city, and cut down on bogus welfare claims, increased the size of the senate, banned clubs and guilds, granted citizenship to foreign-born teachers and physicians, reformed the calendar, enforced anti-corruption laws against guilty nobles, drafted plans for large scale public works, reduced the number of slaves, granted citizenship to residents of Northern Italy, and established new over-seas colonies of Roman citizens. However, even as he carried out these impressive reforms, the remaining Pompeians were raising troops in Spain and threatening to revive the Civil War. Caesar raised an army and marched them to Spain to stamp out the last remaining sparks of the rebellion and faced a tough resistance. He faced his last major battle of the Civil War near the city of Munda. It was actually a very close battle, and at one point Caesar had to fight for his life. However, in the end, Caesar and his forces prevailed in a bloody affair with thousands of casualties on both sides. This was the last gasp of the Pompeian rebellion.

There were many who still held grudges against Caesar and were unhappy that he would be Julius Caesar (Part 4): ruling, but five years of civil war had left everyone exhausted, and no one cared to keep up the fighting. Caesar finally returned to Rome to enjoy peace for the first time in decades. Seemingly every senator tripped over themselves to bestow Caesar with more honors than the last. He was given the titles of liberator and imperator, was given a golden chair to sit on when conducting official business, the month of his birth was renamed Julius in his honor, which is why the seventh month of our calendar is to this day called July. He was allowed to wear costumes that harkened back to those of the early Roman kings, was proclaimed the Father of Rome, was made consul for ten years, and declared dictator for life. A god-like cult began to pop up around him as well. A statue of him was carried in a procession of the gods of Rome. The Roman senate established a new cult to Caesar. He was even given an image next to Romulus, the legendary founder and first king of Rome, with the inscription ‚Äúto the unconquered god.‚Äù Despite all of these honors, Caesar did not have himself declared king, though he did flirt with the idea. Roman tradition had been firmly against rule by a king for hundreds of years, and popular sentiment was too overwhelmingly against it to make it a realistic plan. At this time, plots against Caesar‚Äôs life were everywhere. The would-be conspirators and assassins had many reasons for plotting against Caesar. In modern times we tend to see Caesar‚Äôs assassins as revolutionary republicans who were reacting against monarchy. But this is to see an ancient event through a modern lens. His conspirators had many motivations, and they came from different ideological circles. The one thing they all held in common, was resentment that Caesar stood at the top of the political totem pole. Remember, for an aristocratic Roman, the purpose of life was to accumulate as much political power as possible. You were trying to enhance your auctoritas. Well, with Caesar indefinitely at the top of the food chain, there was only so much auctoritas to be had. They lived to play a specific game, and Caesar had ended the game and named himself the permanent victor. The assassins killed him not because of some commitment to democratic ideals, but from a desire to be allowed to continue to play their game.

Supposedly , a number of omens portended Caesar ‚Äô s death . Julius Caesar (Part 4): However, Caesar did not heed them. He had succumbed to the most human of sins, hubris, and believed that he was too popular and too vital to Rome to be assassinated. He even dismissed his personal body guard. According to the stories, an old prophetess, Spurinna, told Caesar that he would be in grave danger on the ides of March, the ides being the day falling in the middle of the month, the 15 th in the case of March. On the morning of the 15 th , supposedly Caesar awoke to find his wife in a panic. She had experienced horrible nightmares in which she held Caesar‚Äôs lifeless body in her arms. She pleaded with him to not meet with the senate that day, but he disregarded her advice. On the way to the Senate he saw the old witch Spurinna and gently mocked her that the Ides of March had come and he was still alive. She responded ‚ÄúYes, the Ides have come, but not yet passed.‚Äù Caesar took his customary seat at the front of the senate, and began to conduct business in his usual fashion. A senator named Tullius Cimber approached Caesar, and begged him on his knees to pardon his brother who had been exiled. He pulled on Caesar‚Äôs cloak, and this was the sign for the assassins to spring into action. The first senator to reach Caesar was a man named Casca, who was so nervous that his blow barely glanced Caesar‚Äôs neck. Caesar, not fully realizing what was happening, yelled ‚ÄúCasca, you villain! What are you doing!‚Äù stabbed him in the arm with his writing implement, and threw him off the podium. Soon many conspirators started surrounding Caesar and stabbing him with knives they had brought concealed into the senate. Caesar was stabbed 23 times. He continued to struggle and attempt to fight off his assassins, but eventually the loss of blood made him falter. Some said he died silently, but according to others, his last words were to Brutus, the son of his long-time mistress and friend, Servilia. He said, ‚ÄúKai su, teknon?‚Äù which is Greek for ‚Äúeven you, my child?‚Äù It was this sentence that Shakespeare changed slightly and put in Latin, to read ‚ÄúEt tu, Brute?‚Äù And with that, Caesar pulled his toga over his face, and bled to death.

There is so much to say about whether he really ended the Roman Republic and what might have happened to Rome if he had not Julius Caesar (Part 4): come onto the scene. Instead, let‚Äôs do what this podcast was meant for and focus on what made him great. The first thing that I will mention is the number one attribute of greatness. There are many things that go into greatness: intelligence, focus, charisma‚Ä¶ But asI have studied these biographies, one attribute has stood out even more than those: Energy. All these people who accomplish great things have an unbelievable amount of energy. Others are always marveling at their level of activity. If you look at creative people such as authors, poets, painters, and composers, there is a positive correlation between quantity and quality. Studies have shown that those who produce the best works, also produce the most. Mozart and Bach were unmatched in the sheer volume of their creative output, and they were also two of the greatest composers of all time, if not the greatest. Caesar too had this boundless energy. You can look at many parts of his biography and find him commanding a war, writing a book, corresponding with Rome to keep up his political prospects there, and carrying out a few other important activities for good measure. Activity and energy were key to his success. The second thing I will mention is communication. Caesar was probably the greatest communicator of his era, both in quality and volume. He was an excellent orator and writer. He had an uncanny ability to sway and convince people, and was equally adept at charming aristocrats and peasants. He was also a compulsive letter writer who was always keeping in communication with everyone. It is so annoying when you are at a dinner or in a meeting with an executive who won‚Äôt stop emailing on their iPhone, but they might be onto something. The crowds at gladiatorial matches used to get mad because Caesar would dictate letters while the matches were being fought. Humans are the most powerful species on the planet because we can communicate and coordinate our actions. The most powerful humans will never be the strongest, fastest, or even the smartest, they will always be those who can coordinate others the best. The conductor is more powerful than the first violin. The email addicts will inherit the earth. Third, Caesar was a long-term thinker. Remember he always knew his goal was to become the first man in Rome. He gave up his triumph, the greatest lifetime achievement award a Roman could expect to receive, in order to run for consul, because he knew that one triumph was not his goal.

And as a consequence , he eventually got to celebrate five triumphs and achieve his goal of Julius Caesar (Part 4): becoming first man in Rome. Think of how that might have been different if he had taken the immediate gratification of celebrating his first triumph. You also see this in his decision to free his captured enemies during the civil war rather than execute them. In the short term, this mean more enemies fighting against him. And that is why his enemies repeatedly mistreated and executed Caesar‚Äôs soldiers. But in the long run, Caesar was making it easy for people to defect to his side and his enemies were making it difficult for people to defect to theirs. You can accomplish so much just by expanding your timeline longer than other people. You can beat people who are smarter, or faster, or better funded, just by taking a longer-term view. There is the classic example where if you delay retirement savings by 5 years, you have to save about 50% more EVERY YEAR until retirement in order to have the same amount of money at the end. Expanding your time horizon and having a goal that you stick to over a long period of time is an incredibly effective tool for success, and you see that play out in Caesar‚Äôs career. The last thing I‚Äôll mention is Caesar‚Äôs bond with his soldiers. They absolutely loved him. In large part, this was because he understood them. Caesar grew up in a middle-lower class neighborhood. When on campaign, he often shared their food, slept in the same accommodations as them, marched with them rather than riding a horse, and spoke directly to common soldiers rather than only communicating with fellow-officers. These shared circumstances created a bond, and allowed Caesar to be able to understand and relate to his soldiers. People can sniff out ‚Äúfake‚Äù very quickly. For Caesar it was crucial that this bond was not an act. He truly respected and valued his soldiers. Compare this to his senatorial career. Between Gaul and the Civil War, he was not a common senator for nearly 20 years. He forgot what it was like to be a senator. He forgot what motivated them, what was important to them, and he stopped respecting them. Eventually, this lack of connection ended in conspiracy and assassination. There is a danger in leaders getting too far from the common troops.

{"text": "How Steve Jobs got what he wanted: Hey everyone, this is Ben Wilson with a big announcement. How to take over the world is going to be coming to you a little more often. So we've been having a problem, which is that I'm losing contact with some of my listeners. There are actually some podcast feeds that after I haven't posted for a couple months mark my feed inactive. And unsubscribe some of my followers. And other people just assume, after I haven't posted for a couple months, that, you know, I've stopped doing it. And so they stop paying attention and looking for new episodes. So I wanted to post a little bit more often. But I also don't just want to pump out episodes. I don't want to lower the quality that you've come to expect here at How to Take Over the World. So how do I do those two things? How do I post more often without reducing the quality? Well, what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be posting normal episodes at about the same amount. Once every month, once every couple of months, once every six months, I don't know, you know, that it can be variable and it takes time sometimes. But in between those big posts, I'm going to be posting short, three minute, in between isodes, and those will be coming to you on weeks when I don't post big episodes. These in between isodes will contain short reflections on, or lessons from, a historical incident or character. Sometimes, they will include information that I had to cut from one of the larger episodes. It's just something short to give you something to think about. I hope you like this new format, but I really do want to know. This is kind of an experiment. So please email me at ben at httotw. com. Let me know what you think of this new type of episode. Having said all that, without further ado, here is the first short inbetweenisode. When Steve Jobs was only 12, he called Bill Hewlett and asked him for an electronics part. Steve was a member of something called the Explorers Club, a club for young computer aficionados to get together and learn to build their own homebrew electronics and computers. He had hit a dead end on one of his projects. There was one part that he just couldn't find anywhere, a component manufactured by Hewlett Packard.

There was one part that he just couldn ' t find anywhere , a component manufactured by Hewlett Packard . So Steve looked up the company ' s How Steve Jobs got what he wanted: CEO, Bill Hewlett, in the phone book and called him at home, just spoken to the receiver and said, Hello, Mr. Hewlett, and asked for the part that he needed. Hewlett Packard was one of the world's largest technology companies at the time, and Bill Hewlett was a multi millionaire with a packed CEO schedule. But, amused by this 12 year old, he said yes. And if he expected gratitude, he was soon surprised, because the boy responded, I'd also like a summer job. And Bill Hewlett agreed to that as well. Several years later, a man named Al Alcorn had a similar experience. Al was the chief engineer at Atari, the first video game company, and one of the coolest technology companies in the world at the time. He was sitting in his office when a secretary burst in. We got a hippie kid in the lobby, she said. He says he's not going to leave until we hire him. Should we call the cops or let him in? That hippie kid was Steve Jobs. Al let him in. Steve walked into his office, looked Al in the eyes, and said, I'd like the game designer job I saw advertised in the paper. Al gave him the job. Only a few years after that, a man named Regis McKenna also had almost the same experience. When Steve was first starting Apple, he realized they needed a publicist. And he didn't want the second best publicist in the world. He wanted the best. And he considered Regis McKenna to be the best publicist in the world. The problem was, Regis was way too busy and expensive to work for a couple hippies in a garage. And So he said no, but then Steve called him again, and Regis said no again, but Steve called again, and again, and again every day for two weeks until Regis finally said yes. And by the way, Regis McKenna was the guy who designed the famous Apple logo, hired their first CEO, and got them their first funding. Apple as we know it would not exist without Regis McKenna. Apple as we know it would not exist if Steve Jobs hadn't asked for exactly what he wanted for two weeks straight. Steve Jobs had many characteristics that are difficult to copy. He was charismatic and intelligent in a way that few of us can match, but there is something he did that any of us can copy.

{"text": "Picasso: When I was a child, my mother said to me, If you are a soldier, you will become a general. If you are a monk, you will become the pope. Instead, I was a painter And became Picasso. üìç Hello and welcome to how to take over the world. This is Ben Wilson. Today, we are talking about Pablo Picasso, the world famous artist. There are a lot of reasons to study Picasso, even if you are not an artist and don't aspire to be one. One is the way he branded himself. All I have to do is say Picasso and a number of associations come to your mind, greatness, inventiveness, controversy. His name is synonymous. With 20th century art and with greatness. And you saw from that quote, all he had to say was, I am Picasso. And you know what that means. One of Picasso's biographers, Patrick O'Brien, wrote that Picasso was, quote, the most famous, the most controversial, in many ways the most influential, and undoubtedly the richest artist of his age. He was a draftsman of genius, and there is probably no single artist except Giotto or Michelangelo who can justly compare with him in being responsible for so radically altering the course of art in his time. It's also a story to me about innovation and creativity and how to push boundaries. So if you're someone who wants to be creative, who wants to be innovative, or someone who wants to make a name for yourself, then this is a story for you. My sources for this episode are Picasso, a biography by Patrick O'Brien, and the mini biography of Picasso by Gertrude Stein. So with all that said, let's get into it. This is Picasso. First, I want to take a minute to tell you about just ingredients. I'm one of those people who first, I want to take a minute to tell you about just ingredients. If you are someone who.

On October 25th , 1881 Picasso: in M√°laga, Spain, a child was born who was given the name Pablo Diego Jos√© Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno Mar√≠a de los Remedios Cipriano de la Santis Cipriano de la Sant√≠sima Trinidad Ruiz y Picasso. Okay, let me try that one more time. A child was born and given the name Pablo Diego Jos√© Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno Nepomuceno Pablo Diego, Jos√© Francisco de Paula, Juan Nepomuceno, Mar√≠a de los Remedios, Cipriano de la Sant√≠sima Trinidad, Ruiz y Picasso. Okay, I know that was more than a mouthful. That was a few mouthfuls. He would have been known simply as Pablo Ruiz to most people. Picasso was actually his mother's maiden name, and that was the naming convention. Still is in Hispanic countries. Typically you get both names. So Ruiz and Picasso in this example. Usually people would just go by their father's name for short. But you had both technically in your name. We'll talk later about why he dropped a Ruiz and ended up going with Picasso as his last name. But for now, as a child, he would have been known mostly as Pablo Ruiz or Pablo Ruiz, Picasso. M√°laga, where he was born, is in southern Spain. It was by this point a pretty working class city that relied on a lot of agriculture. Patrick O'Brien writes that, quote, The Ruiz family belonged to that traditionally almost non existent body, the Spanish middle class. Which is pretty funny and also true. Picasso had an Spain, historically known as a place of a lot of extremes, extreme wealth and a lot of poverty. Picasso had an interesting relationship with his father, Who was a painter who indoctrinated him to be a artist from his very first moment. Supposedly Pablo's first words were piece, piece, which was short for lapis. He's trying to say lapis, which is the Spanish word for pencil. So Pablo was really born into the art world. O'Brien writes quote, Don Jose, that's his father, was a good teacher with a considerable share of technical knowledge. And later, when he found that he could teach him no more, he ceremonially handed his brushes over to the boy and never painted again. So the relationship with his father was very complicated. On the one hand, he always venerated him as a reliable and authoritative man, you know, Don Jose. And yet, there was also an aspect of perceived weakness because, you know, Picasso surpassed him as an artist. And I think it's", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/picasso", "title": "Picasso", "chunk_index": 2, "publication_date": "2024-07-11", "total_chunks_in_doc": 30}}
{"text": "the one hand , he always venerated him as a reliable and authoritative man , you know , Don Jose . And yet , there was also an aspect of perceived weakness because , you know , Picasso surpassed him as an artist . And I think it ' s Picasso: difficult to surpass your father. At such a young age. Um, Pablo did it when he was in his teens, you know, this is the person who is supposed to be the unshakable rock of your life, the man who is supposed to guide you through life. And now, you know, you're like 13 years old and you're the man. So later in life, Picasso would sometimes paint his father as a passive presence in erotic scenes, essentially depicting him as a cuckold, perhaps an indication of the impotence he perceived in his father. He overtook him as a young teen. The relationship with his mother was very different. Uh, here's what O'Brien writes. His mother, however, stood quite apart the relationship between them was uncomplicated love on either side with some mixture of adoration on hers, and it is perhaps worthwhile recalling Freud's words of Gothe. And it is perhaps worthwhile recalling Freud's words on Goit, on Goethe. And it is perhaps, and it is perhaps worthwhile recalling Freud's words on Goethe, with whom Picasso has often been compared. Quote, Sons who succeed in life have been the favorite children of good mothers. Okay, and this is something I have seen over and over again. That statement is true. Sons who succeed in life have been the favorite child of good mothers. The greats often have these complicated relationships with their fathers, But it appears that as a mother, you basically can't love your son enough. So Thomas Edison, Napoleon, Steve Jobs, Walt Disney, William Randolph Hearst, all these people had doting mothers who showered them with love and affection. And you can add Picasso to that list. So Pablo Ruiz was small, and the most distinctive thing about him was his eyes. Patrick O'Brien writes, He had, in fact, a most luminous and striking eye. A singular, penetrating gaze, always the first thing that people noticed. I commented on this on the Alexander Hamilton episode. He also had a striking gaze, as did many others. Steve Jobs comes to mind. But in every instance, people are transfixed by their steady and unbreaking gaze. It seems to pull people in and capture their full attention. And Picasso had that as well. He is, from an early age, a prodigy. I mentioned that he overtook his father early on, but that's not because his father was necessarily a bad artist, but rather because Pablo Ruiz was exceptional. He just obviously had an incredible talent", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/picasso", "title": "Picasso", "chunk_index": 3, "publication_date": "2024-07-11", "total_chunks_in_doc": 30}}
{"text": "He is , from an early age , a prodigy . I mentioned that he overtook his father early on , but that ' s not because his father was necessarily a bad artist , but rather because Pablo Ruiz was exceptional . He just obviously had an incredible talent Picasso: for drawing and painting from a very, very early age. He He did not, however, have any perceptible aptitude for anything else. He's an extremely indifferent student. He would just get up and leave school in the middle of the day in Malaga. He never paid attention. He was never a good student at anything except for art. In fact, there's a great story from when he's very young and he's at school and he's really bad with numbers and he could barely tell time and he's in school and he sees his uncle walking by. And he yells out to his uncle to come get him out of school. And his uncle shouts back, When do you get out? And he calls back, At one. Because, not being able to tell time, He thought that one would be the earliest possible time, Since it was the lowest number. But thereby, he condemned himself to the rest of the morning in school. So he's trying to trick his uncle into saying, I get out at one. Uh, but he could have said, like, ten. And had him get him in an hour. In 1895, when Picasso is 14, the family moves to Barcelona where his father was working at the school of fine arts. Pablo is admitted as a student, even though he's much too young, but his output at this point already had artistic merit and he takes the entrance exam and he aces it. Accounts vary, but he finishes the assignment well ahead of time. I've seen some people say that applicants were given a month and he finished in a week. Others have said applicants were given a week and he finished it in a few hours, but everyone agrees. That he aces the entrance exam and is a star student at the school of fine arts in Barcelona. And in fact, he quickly outgrows it. And so in 1897, at the age of 16, Pablo goes to Madrid where he once again, aces the entrance exam in a record time at both schools, his attendance is sparse as he frankly, probably doesn't have much to learn from the teachers and he spends most of his time observing daily life And painting, you know, painting on his own, not necessarily doing the school assignments. His output from this time when he's only a teenager is a very high quality.

{"text": "own , not necessarily doing the school assignments . His output from this time when he ' s only a teenager is a very high quality . And some of the paintings verge on the precipice of masterpieces , like extremely high quality painting from a boy who ' s Picasso: just a teenager. One of the things that he's known for is taking these trips out to the countryside with his artist friends to paint. It reminds me quite a bit of Arnold Schwarzenegger, how he would go out into the forest and lift weights with his bodybuilder friends. So here's what O'Brien writes about one of these excursions. He says, They set off with a mule, provisions, a dog, a small boy, and Polaris, that's his, uh, his friend, and Polaris younger brother, Salvador. They went as far as the mule could go, made a fire, and camped for the night in the open air. The next day, carrying their easels and color boxes, Picasso and Polaris climbed up through the forest and eventually found their cave. Here, they stayed for weeks and weeks, painting, drawing, and walking about, bathing in the nearby stream, collecting firewood, and sometimes fossils. They slept on a deep bed of scented grass and leaves, and just outside the cave they kept a great fire burning until late at night. Every few days, Salvador brought them food, bread, wine, rice, beans, potatoes, stockfish, salt, pork, oil, and among other things, Picasso learned to cook. Okay. So this is interesting to me, the comparison between Schwarzenegger, just going out into the forest to just lift until his arms or legs couldn't take it anymore. And Picasso also going out into the countryside to just paint. So I think, especially early on in your career, These retreats can be a great way to remove distractions and focus on mastering your craft. So he eventually leaves Madrid, where he goes back to Barcelona, and joins the intellectual and artistic ferment that was growing there. Barcelona was a center of the growing modernist movement. And the modernists met a fame and the modernists met at a famous cafe called the Quattro Gots. And even though he is one of the youngest artists there, Pablo quickly becomes the unofficial leader at Quattro Gots. So how does he become the leader? Not through any politicking, not through, you know, glad handing and getting to know people, but through sheer talent. Okay, so here's another quote. It says, When he was 18, penniless and unknown, he was accepted as a leading figure at the Quattro Gots. Even by those who disliked him. It was not that he talked much. In fact, he was often silent, moody, withdrawn, absorbed, or apparently", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/picasso", "title": "Picasso", "chunk_index": 5, "publication_date": "2024-07-11", "total_chunks_in_doc": 30}}
{"text": "was 18 , penniless and unknown , he was accepted as a leading figure at the Quattro Gots . Even by those who disliked him . It was not that he talked much . In fact , he was often silent , moody , withdrawn , absorbed , or apparently Picasso: bored, as well he might have been with some of, as well he might have been with some of the morphine creeps who frequented the place. He was always easily bored, and more easily as the years went by. But when he did speak, he spoke well, often wittily, and always with the unconscious authority of a man who could already draw and paint better than any of the artists there, except perhaps one, Nonel. Okay. So as always, the quickest way to leadership is not to ask for it is not to try and, you know, politic your way to the top. It's just to be so good that they can't ignore you. And that's what Pablo was already so good that people have to recognize him as a leader of this movement in Barcelona. Well, Barcelona was a leading center of modernist thought and art, but not the center. That was Paris. Paris was where the action was. And so Picasso decides he needs to be in Paris, and he moves to Montparnasse, which is the neighborhood of Paris that housed the avant garde modernist artists. At this point, he's desperately poor. Selling a few paintings here and there, and only getting by with some generous subsidies from back home. One of the ways he gets by is by eating very little. If you've listened to this podcast for long, that won't surprise you. He was always a very light eater, but especially in these early days, if you've seen pictures of Picasso when he's older, he's He's got maybe a slightly sturdy, filled out frame. He was never fat, but he was a little thicker as an adult. But when he's a young man, he's very, very thin. Notably thin. O'Brien writes, quote, As far as food was concerned, he was naturally abstemonious, and although he smoked continually, he drank little wine, and his aperitif was mineral water. A contemporary, Max Jacob, put it even more succinctly. Uh, he was commenting on Picasso and his roommate, and he said neither Picasso nor his roommate used to eat. Uh, That's it. , that's how he described his eating habits. Picasso, that's how he described his eating habits. Picasso did not used to eat. All right. That's how abstemonious he was.

He ' s still got roots back in Spain . Plus he needs Picasso: financial support from his family. So he's back and forth a little between Spain and Paris. But as time goes on, he spends more and more time in Paris. In 1901, his good friend, Carl's in 1901. In 1901, his good friend Casagamas commits suicide, and this kicks off what becomes known as the Blue Period for Picasso. The Blue Period runs from 1901 to 1904. The paintings are often somber, and almost always use blue as the predominant color, hence Blue Period. But it's a mistake to think of it as one long depressive episode. He could still be sociable and happy, and the fascination with the color blue Seem to transcend the mere association with melancholy. So in other words, he was transfixed by the color for its own sake. And not just for its emotional associations. There is certainly a sad, depressive undercurrent to many of the paintings, probably most of them, but that's not all it is. He's during this time, he's heavily during this time, he's heavily influenced by another artist Cezanne, a French painter. And in fact, Picasso hated to mention influences. He hated this concept of searching for other people's styles and influence in paintings. He thought that a painting stood on its own merit and she, she on its own, but the only people who he ever mentioned as direct influences were Cezanne We're Cezanne and Van Gogh and kind of Matisse, but we'll get to that later. One of the things that is constantly emphasized in all these lives is you need to find your tribe, your people, people who can push you, collaborate with you, connect you to opportunities, give you ideas. And Picasso definitely finds that in Paris, in Montparnasse. He makes friends with the other painters in Paris, but also with the other artists, especially writers, and that was who really formed the core of his social scene early on. So the modernist writer, Gertrude Stein, wrote quote, his friends in Paris were writers rather than painters. Why have painters for friends when he could paint as he could paint? It was obvious that he did not need to have painters in his daily life, and this was true all his life. He needed ideas, anybody does, but not ideas for painting. No, he had to know those who were interested in ideas, but as to knowing how to paint, he was born knowing all of that. Okay, that is probably something of an exaggeration.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/picasso", "title": "Picasso", "chunk_index": 7, "publication_date": "2024-07-11", "total_chunks_in_doc": 30}}
{"text": "ideas , anybody does , but not ideas for painting . No , he had to know those who were interested in ideas , but as to knowing how to paint , he was born knowing all of that . Okay , that is probably something of an exaggeration . Picasso: Obviously, no one is born knowing how to paint, but that's not too much of one. He was already extremely advanced in painting, and so, yeah, like, he didn't need tips. He was more just looking for people with interesting ideas that could inspire him. It reminds me a little bit of my conversation with Mr. Beast, Jimmy Donaldson, and I was asking him like, what YouTubers inspire you? And he's like, you know, I watch YouTube because I like YouTube, but I'm not really taking tips and tricks from other YouTubers. Like I know YouTube, I know how to do this. And so it's interesting to see that similarity between the two of them. In 1904, he wants to, In 1904, he once again becomes consumed with a color, this time a rose. So from 1904 to 1906 is considered his rose period, and it does reflect more comfort, a more settled social scene. You know, at this point, He is firmly settled in Paris. He's got his group of friends, and he's got a generally sunnier disposition. Although, once again, it would be a mistake to associate this period with just a single emotion. It's not like every painting during the Rose Period is happy and cheerful, just as not every painting during the Blue Period is depressing. And for both periods, these paintings, you know, you might have in your mind, you think Picasso, okay, you think cubism, that has not come yet. And so the paintings that he's drawing during these periods are more a continuation of Picasso's. Modernism, which is sort of, um, if you don't know a lot about art, think about, uh, kind of impressionism, uh, going down that track a little bit more. Uh, okay. They're, they're kind of impressionistic, I guess is the best way to describe it. It's around 1907 that things start to get weirder for Picasso. This is what is known as his primitivist movement. And it is here that his paintings start to get more abstract, more two dimensional, more, well, primitive, right? That's the name. One of the things he has. One of the things that has long been debated is the extent of influence of African art on his painting from this time.

There ' s a big fad at this time of modern artists getting interested in primitive art , Picasso: okay? Especially old African tribal masks and things like that. And Picasso always denied that these had a particular influence on him. Again, this is someone who didn't like to acknowledge influences generally, and so it kind of rubbed him in the wrong direction. The wrong way when people are like, Oh, all of these paintings come from this influence of African tribal masks. And he'd say, no, they came from me and how I was feeling in my thoughts. , but, but on a certain level, like, okay, maybe it didn't really influence him in a direct sense. As you said, although he did acknowledge it a little bit later, what can't be denied anyway, is that these African tribal, what can't be denied anyway, is that this African tribal art had a big influence on the scene in Paris. And that then, of course, influenced the direction of Picasso's art, because he was moving in the same direction as a lot of people. He was an innovator, he was kind of leading out in that way, but he was definitely not the only one, and he was not even the first one, uh, to be going in this direction. I've been referring to him as Picasso now. I should mention that he had slowly transitioned I'm referring to him as Picasso now. I should mention that he had slowly transitioned the way that he had signed his paintings from Ruiz, or Ruiz Picasso, to Pablo R. Picasso, and then just Pablo Picasso, or Picasso. Some people see this as a rejection of his father. That's probably overstated. It was more a simple move to be unique. Ruiz is quite a common name in Spain. It's, uh, it's not exactly Smith. But it's not much less common than that. There are a lot of Ruiz's, but Picasso is a very unique name of mysterious and indeterminate origins. Some people have ascribed Moorish origins to the name. Others think that there is a Sephardic Jewish connection. No one knows for sure exactly where the name comes from. But the important thing is, there are very few people in Spain with the last name Picasso. It's very uncommon, very rare. And so Pablo, you know, wanted to stand out. He would be one of many notable Ruiz's in the world. I mean, go Google the name Pablo Ruiz. Um, I just did it.

And even Picasso: today, there are like a bunch of famous Pablo Ruiz's. There's an Argentine singer. It looks like a soccer player, a baseball player, an artist, ironically, of course, none of these people were alive at the time, but the point is that it was a name that a lot of people had as a name. , Kind of like Ben Wilson, completely unremarkable, but there is only one Pablo Picasso. And so he uses that as a way to set himself apart. Just another indicator that he is someone special. So I don't know, maybe there's a lesson there. Maybe I should start going by my middle name Dow because there are comparatively few dows out there, you know, I, I don't know. Hello and welcome to how to take over the world. This is B Dow Wilson. We'll see. But I think O'Brien says it quite well. Uh, here's how he sums it up. He says, The real significance of this unusual striking name is that it had at least some influence in setting its owner slightly apart, of making him feel that he was not quite the same as other people. A feeling that was to be reinforced by several other factors quite apart from that isolating genius which soon made it almost impossible for him to find any equals. Okay, I think that's a good summary. Okay, so I've talked about the Blue Period, the Rose Period, and his African or Primitivist Period, but I haven't mentioned any specific paintings. One of the difficulties in doing so is that there are just so many of them. He was incredibly prolific. Here's a good quote about that, uh, again from O'Brien. He says, Picasso was one of the hardest working painters, sculptors, draftsmen, etchers that ever lived. Where do I get this power of creating and forming? I don't know. I have only one thought. Work. I paint just as I breathe. When I work, I relax. Doing nothing or entertaining visitors makes me tired. It's still often three in the morning before I switch off my light, he said. And this would continue for basically his entire life. You know, finally, in the last two years before he died, he slowed down a little, but he would just paint and paint and paint for his entire life.

{"text": "You know , finally , in the last two years before he died , he slowed down a little , but he would just paint and paint and paint for his entire life . Friends died , lovers came and went , wars came , wars ended , spring , Picasso: summer, fall, winter, poverty, riches. Through it all, Picasso maintained an almost unparalleled, He was just addicted to painting. He loved it. He was good at it. As he said, he painted like he breathed. It was habitual. It was almost like a ticked. It was almost like a tick. He worked out everything, all of his emotions, his feelings about the world, through painting. So that is to say, there are some paintings more famous than others, through all of these periods, but there are none that stand out so much as to be truly air defining. It's just an extremely high level of art. Of extremely high quality output in baseball terms. I know only 50 percent of my audience is American. So, you know, some of these sports analogies I know, but in baseball terms, he's just hitting triples the entire time. Triples triples in terms of his work style. He has this pure obsessive work style where he embraced chaos and just forgot about all comfort, everything except for work. Okay. Here's a quote about that. Um, this is from a friend usually found him in the middle of the studio, near the stove, sitting on a rickety chair, rather a low one as I remember. The discomfort did not worry him in the least. He fixed the canvas on the lowest notch of the easel, which forced him to bend almost double as he painted. If he had to look attentively at the palette, it was on the floor, a mass of white in the middle of other colors, mostly blue, dotted around the edge. He still kept a sideways eye upon the canvas. His concentration never left either. Both were in his field of vision and he took in both at the same time. Okay. So I love that style. Like I've been guilty of this, right. Of trying, thinking I need to optimize my work setup. I need just the right number of monitors and, uh, I need an ergonomic keyboard and ergonomic chair. Meanwhile, Picasso just can't think about anything except for painting. And so he's got, um, you know, his palette on the floor and his, his, And so he's got his palette on the floor, and like the easel is too low and he's got to bend to paint. Like, he didn't care about any of that. He just wanted to get to painting as quickly as possible.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/picasso", "title": "Picasso", "chunk_index": 11, "publication_date": "2024-07-11", "total_chunks_in_doc": 30}}
{"text": "' s got his palette on the floor , and like the easel is too low and he ' s got to bend to paint . Like , he didn ' t care about any of that . He just wanted to get to painting as quickly as possible . Picasso: And, and he had no distractions, like nothing in his room, except for the canvas and the paint. And this reminds me of this idea. Of setting apart. Okay. So he had set apart a space to paint. And when he painted, he had set apart that time to paint and nothing was going to distract him. Nothing was income between him and painting. So that idea of setting apart, I think is really powerful. So when I was 19 years old, I served a mission for my church. I was one of those dorky guys with the white shirts and ties and name tags. Okay. And I walked and biked the streets of El Paso, speaking Spanish, trying to convert people to my church, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints, Mormonism. And before I left home to go serve in El Paso, I was set apart. A leader of the church put his hands on my head, gave me a blessing, and set me apart as a missionary. And what that meant was that for those two years, they were literally set apart from normal life. I wrote home once a week and I called home on Christmas and Mother's Day. But otherwise I didn't speak to my family for two years. Didn't have a smartphone, didn't talk to my friends other than writing letters once a week. I didn't go to the movies, didn't play video games, didn't have a computer, didn't listen to music. Two years of my life were just set apart for this one purpose of serving this mission. And okay, and that is, um, setting apart on a big scale, right? Two whole years of my life were set apart. But I think you can also do it on a much smaller scale. Set apart two hours, for example. Two hours of complete focus and commitment. And I think you see that in Picasso's work style. The same idea of setting apart. While he was working, he was set apart from the world. No distractions. And I think it's similar for Picasso, um, to me. Great, now I'm comparing myself to Picasso. Um, in that, Painting was spiritual for him. Someone asked him why he didn't paint any religious art. His answer was, what do you mean? And his answer was, what do you mean by religious art? It's an absurdity. How can you make religious art one day", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/picasso", "title": "Picasso", "chunk_index": 12, "publication_date": "2024-07-11", "total_chunks_in_doc": 30}}
{"text": ". Someone asked him why he didn ' t paint any religious art . His answer was , what do you mean ? And his answer was , what do you mean by religious art ? It ' s an absurdity . How can you make religious art one day Picasso: and another kind of the next. Okay. So in other words, everything was religious to him. If your painting didn't touch on fundamental ideas of universal truth and experience, then what the hell were you doing painting in the first place? Okay, painting was sacred to him. That's why it was so set apart another quote I love from O'Brien on this quote Nothing shows his sense of the sacred more clearly than his saying that a really good painting was good Because it had been touched by the hand of God whose existence of course he denied from time to time Okay, I think in order to do great work in some sense You must regard it as sacred like Picasso did and that might seem out of place depending on your line of work You But I don't think it is. I think through a commitment to craft and workmanship, almost any effort can be made sacred. It reminds me of the story I've heard of a composer. Um, I think it was Felix Mendelssohn, but I'm spitballing here. So don't hold me to that. But when he worked at home in his private office, composing music, he would be wearing his finest clothing, like a big suit with a waistcoat and everything. And someone asked him why he wore such fine clothing while composing alone. And he said, because I'm going before God. And Machiavelli actually wrote something similar, that he wore his finest clothing when writing because he felt like he was going to commune with the eminent men of the past. And I think all of this applies even when you are not a believer, as Picasso was not. But everyone who achieves great things, even those who are not believers in the strictly religious sense like Napoleon, like Picasso, like Steve Jobs, they all believe in something bigger than themselves, whether they call that fate, or destiny, or providence. And I believe that's a very powerful idea that will raise the level of your work. When you like Picasso set aside, when you like Picasso set apart that time for your work and view it as an opportunity to be touched by God, right. To commune with that greater power than yourself. And you can see this in Picasso in the way he regarded money. He was a person, right? So of course he recognized the need to make money and he often used money as a competitive benchmark. You know, it didn't bother him at all. When his paintings were sold.

{"text": ". He was a person , right ? So of course he recognized the need to make money and he often used money as a competitive benchmark . You know , it didn ' t bother him at all . When his paintings were sold . Fetched a big price Picasso: on the open market, but he actually didn't like to sell his paintings He grew attached to them and he preferred to keep them when possible and got annoyed when he heard of buyers reselling them In fact, he hated to finish paintings because as long as they were unfinished they were alive But as soon as he was finished, they were done. He referred to them as dead. He couldn't paint them anymore. So, of course he did finish a lot of paintings, as I said. He was extremely prolific. But calling them done always came with a great deal of reluctance and resistance from Picasso. And that was because he had this almost religious attachment to his paintings. As long as we're talking about Picasso's work habits and his extreme output, it's worth pointing out that he was not a shut in or a workaholic. Well, he was kind of workaholic. As long as we're talking about Picasso's work habits and his extreme output, it's worth pointing out that he was not a shut in at this time. He loved to carouse, to be social, to talk with friends, to visit music halls, to party, basically. And I think people who plan out their days by the minute and don't make any time for fun are not only unhappy. but are not on the path to greatness. From Napoleon, to Julius Caesar, to Benjamin Franklin, to Picasso, great achievers always make time to have fun. A, because you need it, right? You just need it. It raises your spirits, you're gonna feel better. But also because the things that you enjoy in life, Things that are fun to you. It's just an essential part. They inspire you and often they can influence your work. And it's just an essential part of a vital, productive life. So this is a mistake I see a lot of people make. They are, this is a mistake I see a lot of people make. They are ambitious and they want to dedicate every second of every day. To their work and, um, and even, and that's just not realistic, nor is it optimal. Even if it was realistic, we see from time and time again, from people like Picasso to Benjamin Franklin to Napoleon, they make time for fun. It matters to becoming great.

I want to tell you about one of those podcasters, one of those podcasts. It's called founders by David Senra. It's like how to take over the world. But specifically for founders, people who found companies, and he goes through the great founders in history and draws out great lessons to learn. Uh, it's an incredible podcast. It's extremely well done. I've been listening for years. His recent episode on J. Paul Getty, I actually, he did two episodes recently on J. Paul Getty. I love those. I w I would listen to those. but He also focuses on. Other figures that founders look up to. And one of those is Napoleon and he's got some great. Episodes on Napoleon. And so I love listening to those and comparing them to my research and my reading on Napoleon to see what someone with a founder mindset specifically takes away from Napoleon's life. So it's an incredible podcast. If you love how to take over the world, you will love founders. Go give it a listen, wherever you get your podcasts. üìç This episode is also brought to you by all the hacks. All The Hacks is an amazing podcast. It's by my friend Chris Hutchins. Chris is this obsessive personality who knows everything about everything. Anytime that he learns about something, he loses his mind. He goes so extreme. And learns everything. I've told this story before, but I told him I was thinking of getting a sauna and he sent me this spreadsheet of like every possible purchasable sauna, including like direct ordering from China and gave me all the attributes of the saunas. Uh, it's the spreadsheet with like 15 different columns, you know, the price, what they come with, what they're made out of everything. And so he does this on all the hacks for everything that you could possibly want to learn about. So if you want to learn about optimizing your credit card points. He's got an episode on that. If you want to learn about optimizing your sleep and the best products and the best way to do that, he's got an episode on that.

That is all the hacks and you can listen Picasso: to it wherever you get your podcasts. üìç Okay. , uh, he's sort of working through the popular styles. He's one of the best painters he can copy almost anyone. He can copy almost anyone. You know, if someone says, do a Matisse, he can quickly sit down and do a passable pastiche of Matisse. And there are distinctive elements to Picasso, but more than anything, he is versatile and searching. Trying to find Something new it seems like his work is building towards something although neither he nor anyone else knows what that is yet Some other things about Picasso from this time. He was a great walker He loved to take long walks through Paris to think and observe especially at night And this is another thing that tends to unite great achievers They are great walkers and Nietzsche said that all truly great thoughts are conceived while walking And Schwarzenegger talks about how important walks are to him, to his creativity. Steve Jobs, when he had meetings, oftentimes liked to take those meetings on a walk, rather than sitting down across a desk. So I think walking is an underrated part of creativity, something that mattered a lot to Picasso. Another thing worth pointing out about this time period is that, you know, he was a horrible student. As I said, well, he was also just horrible at most things other than painting. Not that he was an inherently untalented or stupid person. Quite the contrary, obviously. He was naturally witty, charismatic, perceptive. He had a great memory. It's just that he was so consumed with painting and so sure of himself and his abilities that he could hardly be troubled with other matters. So for example, O'Brien writes, At no period of his life did time mean much to Picasso, still less punctuality. And writing a letter, finding an envelope, a postage stamp, were only a little less of a torment than doing up a packet and sending it away. The hand that could model the most satisfying statue of a goat known to man could only, with the greatest reluctance, be brought to make a parcel. And even then, the resulting bundle, with its inadequate paper and odd bits of string, could scarcely confront the post. Okay, so this is someone who is completely feckless. in his day to day life can barely send a package, right? Like he's handing these things over to the postmaster who's like, what is this? But he's able to get by because he has a string of lovers", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/picasso", "title": "Picasso", "chunk_index": 16, "publication_date": "2024-07-11", "total_chunks_in_doc": 30}}

But he ' s able to get by because he has a string of lovers Picasso: and agents who recognize his talent and are able to sort of shepherd him through life. So great geniuses like Picasso often need to be protected and taken care of because their minds are so consumed with their work that they struggle with the duties of day to day life. And I know that this sort of. Thinking is kind of antiquated. People take pride these days in being a normal person, being a man of the people. Right. I do my own laundry. I do my own dishes personally. I don't think there is anything noble in doing your own cooking and cleaning. I do a fair amount of mine out of necessity, but I don't like toot my horn about it. Okay. I do think geniuses, and I'm not trying to lump, I do think geniuses, and I'm not trying to lump myself in with them, but geniuses should be enabled in this way. Even if it creates a little bit of, you know, prima Donna syndrome as it As it did with Picasso, like, yes, he was a prima donna, frankly, in a lot of different ways. But, I mean, what do you want? Would you rather have Picasso spending 10 percent of his days, you know, doing laundry? No. I'm glad that he spent that time painting and creating. Okay, so from this sort of African primitivist period, he makes the leap to what would be his most lasting contribution to the world of art. Cubism. A painting called La Demoiselle d'Avignon is generally considered to be the first cubist work by Picasso, or by anyone for that matter. Although you can go look, although you can go look it up. I know you're going to have trouble googling it based on my pronunciation. , La Demoiselle d'Avignon. Try again, maybe that's helpful. It's not a complete statement. Of what would become cubism. It definitely has cubist traits, but you can tell that he's kind of working it out in real time. But with this painting, Picasso thinks he has landed on something and produces a number of cubist paintings, which he keeps to himself. And then he unveils to some artist friends on, uh, which he then unveils to some artist friends one night in a, in a sort of coming out party.

O ' Brien describes the reaction , he says , He called some chosen friends to his studio , wishing to communicate this message from another world , whose aesthetics were based not Picasso: on conventional beauty, still less on anecdote, prettiness, or charm, but on some great force without a name. They could not grasp it at all. Their only reactions were shock, alarm, regret, dismay, some nervous or indignant laughter. the percipient shook his head and said, what a loss to French art. Now, keep in mind, these are not like people he's pulling off the street. These are not people like you and me. These are modern artists. Okay. People who already have their heads in the world of the weird and esoteric and the forward looking, but even to this select group, this is too far out. This is too bizarre, too weird. They can't grasp it at all. And cubism is indeed really hard to understand, even harder to explain. I won't pretend to fully grasp it myself. Understanding it is difficult in part because Picasso refused to explain it. Okay, here's a quote. Here's a quote from Picasso himself. When we invented Cubism, we had no intention whatsoever of inventing Cubism. We simply wanted to express what was in us. Not one of us drew up a plan of campaign, and our friends the poets followed our efforts attentively, but they never dictated to us. Okay, as I said, Picasso hated explaining his art. So there was no statement on, you know, this is cubism, this is why we did it, this is what it means. No, he just, this is it. He put it out in the world. He believed that art should stand on its own merits. If you wanted any explanations, consult the art. You'll find all your answers there, or not. And if not, it's not for you, apparently. Later in life, when Picasso was famous and his art very valuable, a woman asked him what one of his paintings represented. And he responded, Ma'am, that painting represents 20 million francs. And, you know, um, O'Brien writes that, um, when people asked him what stuff meant, he would commit himself, quote, to use mockery, bad faith, and self contradiction with baffling skill. Okay. So if, if anyone actually didn't know not to ask him the stuff and did ask him, Hey, what does this mean? He would answer with non sequiturs with riddles with just, you know, He would troll them, essentially. He would troll them. And I actually", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/picasso", "title": "Picasso", "chunk_index": 18, "publication_date": "2024-07-11", "total_chunks_in_doc": 30}}
{"text": "' t know not to ask him the stuff and did ask him , Hey , what does this mean ? He would answer with non sequiturs with riddles with just , you know , He would troll them , essentially . He would troll them . And I actually Picasso: think that Picasso's refusal to explain himself is one of the attributes that explains part of the popularity of cubism. I tend to agree with his argument that art should stand on its own, but it was also a great marketing technique, although I don't think he meant it as such. But, I mean, think about it. It creates a sense of mystery, a sense of gravity. It challenges the viewer. You figure it out. And people always value more highly those things, That they work for. Okay. So, so this lack of explanation makes it more difficult to explain Cubism, but I will try. Okay. I'm not an artist. I'm free to do so. And of course, take all this with a grain of salt as I am quite honestly, way out of my depth here. Um, I know some things about history and some things about some things, but painting is really not one of them, but this is just how I understand it. Okay. The stock explanation. If you like go to Wikipedia that you get about cubism is that it represents perspective and time. Okay. So you're able to see an object through space and time by seeing it from multiple perspectives simultaneously. Okay. So yeah, these cubes and one might represent. You know, an element of the object from the front and another from the side and one from the future and one from the present. I am not satisfied by this, especially because I just don't think it accurately captures what it's like to see a cubist painting. Okay? When I look at a Picasso from this cubist era, I don't feel like I'm seeing something through time from multiple perspectives. It I understand it differently. Here's how I understand it. For most time. History, here's how I understand it, for most of time, the history of art is the history of trying to more realistically render the real world. Okay, that is why da Vinci was so revolutionary, because he was able to use perspective and shadow and shading to more realistically render three dimensional objects. And it only progresses from there with painting becoming more and more realistic, over the centuries. Of course, there's always an element of, of meaning of passion, capturing beauty and emotion. So it's definitely not as simple as more realistic equals better, but that is one major thrust of artistic development. However, in the 19th century, you reach sort", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/picasso", "title": "Picasso", "chunk_index": 19, "publication_date": "2024-07-11", "total_chunks_in_doc": 30}}

So it ' s definitely not as simple as more realistic equals better , but that is one major thrust of artistic development . However , in the 19th century , you reach sort Picasso: of an end point and this coincides with photography. It is now possible to render the world completely realistically through photos. And also painting techniques were becoming so advanced that they too did not leave much room to work with. There just wasn't much to do in terms of rendering objects more accurately. And so you see the opposite movement. Beginning with Impressionism, rather than trying to faithfully render things, the objective is to deconstruct reality. To capture the essence of something, the artistic merit of it, the emotion, by rendering it less realistically. Right? How little can I give you and have you still get the essential meaning of what I'm trying to communicate here. So impressionism is the start of this, where you have the general form of a thing, but without sharp details. And then cubism is a major step in which most basic components are there just enough to give you an idea of something. So if you think of a cubist painting of a violin or a face, you basically could not give less information and still have an idea of what is being depicted. Okay, so this reaches kind of an end point, right? Like, cubism, yeah, in that way it is interesting, right? I can take a face, And what is the least amount of information with the least amount of context that I can give you? And you still get what I'm trying to get across. The only possible progression to be made is what you eventually get with Pollock and Rothko, where the communication is further deconstructed into pure color. There are a couple steps. In between, obviously, abstractism, purism, um, but that is the long arc of it, essentially. This doesn't explain all of art, because something like surrealism moves on a different axis, I think. But this explains a lot of what cubism was. The creative act of demonstrating the essence of a thing with as little information as possible. And if you want to see a deeper meaning to it, perhaps, uh, maybe this was the idea, that by avoiding the superfluous, you can see more clearly into the heart, the meaning of a subject, right? I'm stripping away everything else by communicating the minimum possible visual information you can see straight into the heart of the thing. You're not distracted by shapes and lighting and shading. All you see is the emotion, the essence. I'm not sure cubism necessarily does this successfully, but that is how I understand it.

It's obviously not super helpful as an explanation. O'Brien refers to it as quote, an anarchist bomb tossed into Western European painting. Well, whatever its intention, cubism is deeply unpopular at first, as you just heard. But of course it is a subject of great curiosity from fellow artists who are trying to understand it. Again, like I said, there's that mystery that you figured out. And so. All these artists are like, yeah, I want to understand. I want to figure out what you're getting at here. And as we all know, it would grow over time to become an extremely popular and influential movement. I also think that, uh, it's, as I said, it's mystery was a part of it's a lure. I also think it's controversy. It's unpopularity. is a part of the point, right? It challenges you. There's a great story from the book Becoming Steve Jobs. He's at Next and he wants to make a splash. So he comes up with this idea of two programmers working on two computers, one, a Sun system, which is one of their competitors, and one working on one of their computers, a Next computer. And of course, uh, they're, they're carrying out the same task. And the programmer working on the Next computer finishes much earlier. Then the son programmer and has time to play games while the son guy struggles to finish his work. And Mike Slade, who's the head of marketing for next comes up with a different idea and he has this elaborate campaign outlined and Steve jobs tells him, Nope. And this is a quote. The only thing that counts is picking a fight. And if you'll remember one of his other best ads, the 1984 ad was also all about picking a fight. And Steve was right. Picking a fight is probably the best way to get attention. If you're walking down the street and you see two guys on the corner playing basketball, you may or may not stop to watch. But if you're walking down the street and you see two guys throwing punches", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/picasso", "title": "Picasso", "chunk_index": 21, "publication_date": "2024-07-11", "total_chunks_in_doc": 30}}

But if you ' re walking down the street and you see two guys throwing punches Picasso: at each other, you have to stop and see what's going on. So I think one of the things that explains Cubism's success is that it essentially picks a fight with the art world. It says, no, art is not about being pretty or beautiful. It's not going to make you feel comfortable. It's controversial by its very nature. Now cubism is the major innovation of Picasso's life, and he would never have another one like it. That doesn't mean. that his experimentation stopped there. He did experiment with other styles over the years, including Surrealism, uh, but he was never a master of any of those, nor was he a great innovator in those fields. The one great artistic innovation of his lifetime, and it was a great one, was Cubism. Okay, so that is really the 19 teens, and into the early 20s, that Cubism is happening. He's innovating there, it starts with this deeply unpopular movement, and people are intrigued by it, And it starts to gain some acceptance, especially in artistic circles, and starts to gain popularity through the 19 teens. I guess I'll kind of skip through the 1920s. As my intern Michael said, the plot basically boils down to he's happy, he's sad, he's happy, he's sad. And through it all, he paints. He never stopped painting. The 1930s bring us probably Picasso's most famous painting, Guernica. It was painted in response to a massacre in the Spanish Civil War. Okay, so Spanish Civil War is kind of a preview of World War II. Uh, it's a conflict between Spanish fascists, led by Francisco Franco, And Spanish communists, the point is the city of Guernica, uh, the fascists bomb it. Franco's German allies, actually, they were the ones with the air power. So fascist Spain is supported by Hitler and the Germans. And, they bomb the city of Guernica, which is the small city outside of Bilbao. They kill a number of people, including some civilians. It was originally reported to be something like 1, 500 civilians killed out of a town with only a population of 7, 000. Okay, so this horrible massacre. It turned out upon further investigation, the true number was probably much lower, perhaps as low as 150 civilians killed. But for our purposes at the time, everyone is running with this 1, 500 number. And it seems like", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/picasso", "title": "Picasso", "chunk_index": 22, "publication_date": "2024-07-11", "total_chunks_in_doc": 30}}

But for our purposes at the time , everyone is running with this 1 , 500 number . And it seems like Picasso: this huge atrocity. Now, Picasso had always been a vaguely left wing person, but he had tried to stay mostly apolitical for whatever reason. I think it just didn't concern him. Art was what mattered to him. But Guernica is his first piece of political art. And it's the first time that he includes a political statement. So actually before he finishes it, he releases a statement on the massacre. He says, the Spanish conflict is reactions fight against the people, against freedom. My whole life as an artist has been nothing but one unceasing war against reaction and against the death of art. How could it be thought even for a moment? In the picture I am now working on, and which I shall call Guernica, and in all my recent work, I clearly express my loathing for the military castes. That has plunged Spain into a sea of suffering and death. Okay, so he releases that statement as he's working on Guernica. And when he completes it, it is a masterpiece. It's a major success when it comes out. It's a black and white cubist painting. And while I wouldn't call myself cubism's biggest fan, it does seem to lend itself uniquely well to expressing the horrors of war. You have this, this twisted expression. Of, uh, uh, you have this twisted expression of, you have this twisted expression of this massacre and you have this twisted expression of this massacre and the lack of context and the multiple perspectives, the, the, the confusion really does well in conveying the senselessness and ugliness of a massacre, one interviewer. And again, Guernica is the only painting where he was forthcoming. About explaining its purpose and the symbols, one interviewer described his interaction with Picasso like this. Picasso kept nodding his head as I spoke. Yes, he said, the bull there represents brutality, the horse the people. Yes, there I use symbolism, but not in the others. During the same interview, he observed, apropos of his political consciousness, there is no deliberate sense of propaganda in my painting. Except in Guernica, I said. Yes, he replied, except in the Guernica. In that, there is a deliberate appeal to people, a deliberate sense of propaganda. Okay, and Guernica is kind of a watershed moment for him. He always tried to be as apolitical as possible, but the conflicts of the 1930s and 40s forced his hand.

So first there was Guernica and his statement in opposition to the Franco led Picasso: Spanish government. And then there was the German occupation of Paris during World War II. Picasso chose not to leave Paris. It was just too much his home to abandon it. And the only other place that he could call home, Spain, was already ruled by fascists. And during the war, he didn't participate in any armed resistance. He had no contact with intelligence agencies. He wasn't part of the underground or the resistance. He undertook no heroic actions during the war, but I mean, he was in his sixties by this time and past the age of wartime heroics, if he had ever had that sort of disposition, which I don't think he ever did. There is one famous though, untrue story explaining where he was going at a German checkpoint in the city and the soldiers were skeptical of his claim that he was an artist. And, uh, so they're saying, you know, who are you really? And so he pulled out a miniature painting of Guernica on a postcard and showed it to the soldier who replied, you did this? And Picasso supposedly replied, no, you did. Okay. Again, not true, but a fun story. What he really did do during World War II was suffer through harsh conditions and continue to paint. He did join the Communist Party in the 1930s, but even that was marked by some amount of mutual distrust and disappointment. His statement upon joining the party was pretty milquetoast. Here's what he said. My joining the Communist Party is the logical outcome of my whole life and of the whole body of my work. For I am proud to say that I have never looked upon painting as an art intended for mere pleasure or amusement. Since line and color are my weapons, I have used them in my attempt at gaining a continually greater understanding of the world and of mankind, so that this understanding might give us a continually greater freedom. Okay, it's not the world's most eloquent or persuasive argument in favor of communism. Having said that, Picasso was a useful piece of propaganda for the communists for a time. However, like he was never very doctrinaire, and when word leaked about the gulags in the USSR, Picasso was quite critical of the Stalin regime and never involved himself in politics as much as the communists would have liked. There's a good quote from the Spanish painter Salvador Dali, who is in fact pretty right wing, And I think his quote demonstrates how people felt about Picasso's half hearted", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/picasso", "title": "Picasso", "chunk_index": 24, "publication_date": "2024-07-11", "total_chunks_in_doc": 30}}

Dali said, Picasso is a painter. So am I. Picasso is a Spaniard. So am I. Picasso is a communist and neither am I. Okay. So he was a communist, both communists and non communists didn't fully buy it. I think it's, it's maybe more appropriate to think of him as an anarchist or as someone who was fundamentally, Left wing in orientation, but apolitical. After the war, Picasso does a number of things. He had explored a number of different mediums. He had sculpted previously, but he does much more of it after the 1940s. He also tries his hand at pottery. He does some illustrations for books. He creates backgrounds and scenes for ballets composed by Eric Satie. He even tries his hand at poetry, uh, which you can still read and is frankly not that good. He innovates a little bit in his painting. Again, nothing like Cubism, though. Here's what O'Brien says about it. From this time onwards, he repeatedly revolutionized his own painting, drawing, and sculpture. But there were personal revolutio Let me try that again. From this time onwards, he repeatedly revolutionized his own painting, drawing, and sculpture. But these were personal revolutions, since by definition, he could not throw down what was already laid in ruins. Okay, in other words, like, If we view cubism as a deconstruction, there just wasn't that much left to deconstruct when it came to art. During this time, I haven't spoken much of his personal life. He had married in 1918 to a woman named Olga. They had separated very acrimoniously in 1935. And since then, he had had a number of long term relationships. Picasso's love life is very interesting to people. He could be very warm and friendly and loving, like a true Spaniard of that time. He could also be extremely possessive, controlling, neglectful, and even abusive. I will spare you the dirty details of his many dalliances, affairs, and mistresses. I will sum it all up by saying Picasso is one of the most impulsive men I have ever read about. Pure Dionysian will. And that is part of what made him great. He's painting what is an expression. Of those impulses of that will. And it's a big part of what made basically every single one of his relationships, such a disaster as well. you know, Often our flaws are the flip side of our greatest virtues.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/picasso", "title": "Picasso", "chunk_index": 25, "publication_date": "2024-07-11", "total_chunks_in_doc": 30}}

And it ' s a big part of what made basically every single one of his relationships , such a disaster as well . you know , Often our flaws are the flip side of our greatest virtues . Picasso: And that was true in the case of Picasso, before the war. He had been somewhat famous, mostly in artistic circles and amongst collectors, but it's after the war that he became like famous, famous, uh, in a way that people actually knew. Okay. So listen to this quote before the war, he had been a very well known painter. Famous at least by name among all Europeans who knew anything about art, vaguely notorious among the general public. But it did not spread far beyond his own world. His reputation, though great, was largely a matter of hearsay for those out of reach of the galleries in the capital cities. And I find that fascinating as well. It's just interesting to me that Picasso was more famous than any of his actual paintings were. I think that is one of my biggest takeaways, that the greatest creation of Picasso's life Was Picasso, right? Picasso, the legend. Like, yes, he was born Pablo Ruiz, Picasso, as well as like 30 other names that you heard at the beginning, but Picasso, that word, that was the creation, that was his own creation. And he did this through branding, through his unique name, his unique style of dress, more than anything. He did it through cubism, his unique invention for the world. He also did it by his strategic silence, his refusal to explain himself by remaining an enigma. . He has a quote that I think explains well, at least a piece of how he created this mystique, this persona. Now you have to understand that during this quote, he is trolling. As I said before, he, he could be very sarcastic. He liked to troll his detractors. Uh, so that's what he's doing here. So don't take this 100 percent seriously, but I think there is an element of truth in it as well. Here's what he said. I myself, since Cubism, and even before, have satisfied these masters and critics with whatever bizarre extravagances pass through my head. And the less they understood, the more they admired me. By amusing myself with all these games, by amusing myself with all these games, Robusses and Arabesques, I became famous very quickly. And for a painter, fame means selling, making money, making a fortune, growing wealthy. So today, as you know, I am famous and I am rich.

I am only a public in I am only a public entertainer who has understood his times, and to the utmost of his own powers, has exploited the silliness, the vanity, and the stupidity of his contemporaries. Now, obviously, he was not really so cynical, and the expressions of his art were very sincere. And yet, I do think he had an intuitive understanding of how his expressions and lack thereof affected people. And I also think he had an intuitive understanding of what would upset the public, and he enjoyed that. you know, The fact that he's trolling shows that he enjoys trolling. So yes, cubism was more than just the cynical attempt to excite and annoy and anger the public. I do think there was an element of that as well, that he knew it would have that effect and he liked that. Well, again, and this is one of the main through lines of his life, even as he becomes very, very famous after World War II, he never stops painting. O'Brien summarizes it this way. He was a man who never stopped working all his life, whose output has been estimated at over 15, 000 paintings to say nothing of his sculpture, engravings, and countless drawings. The crowning, moment of his life is in 1971, the Paris that he had entered as a starving artist more than 60 years previously celebrated him in grand style. The great gallery of the Louvre itself was rehung and some of the most illustrious names in the history of art, having been moved aside, eight magnificent Picassos took their place. It was a most delicate triumphal stroke worthy of the nation.

It was a most delicate, triumphal stroke, worthy of the nation and the man. While this apex of his career actually came very near to the end of his life, Picasso had always had an extreme phobia of death. He had trouble discussing it, didn't want to be a He had trouble discussing it, didn't want to be around it, rarely painted it, he wouldn't paint any self portraits after he started to visibly age, and he didn't even attend his father's funeral.

With that said, let‚Äôs get into it and hear about the rest of the story of the Wright Brothers, after this quick break. *** Insert pre-roll *** 1901 is the year of disaster for the Wright Brothers. It‚Äôs the year that Wilbur declares that man will not fly for a thousand years. They thought progress would be rapid year over year as they came every summer to Kitty Hawk to learn to fly, and instead in their second year they go backwards, because they had tried to rely on the calculations of others, and those calculations had proved to be completely wrong and useless. The brothers began the journey from North Carolina to Dayton in near total despair. But as the journey wore on, the silence gave way to wearied talk about what they would do when they returned home. And then small talk turned into big talk. By the time they got home, a few days after departing Kitty Hawk, the brothers were excited about the prospect of flight once again, and had a number of ideas of things they could improve and processes they could implement to speed up progress. It reminds me of the Steve Jobs quote from Pixar when things were not working out he said ‚ÄúWe would all get depressed‚Ä¶ but not all of us at once.‚Äù It‚Äôs natural as a founder to get depressed, or as anyone who‚Äôs trying to accomplish something great, by virtue of what you‚Äôre trying to do, it‚Äôs going to be hard.

{"text": ", or as anyone who ‚Äô s trying to accomplish something great , by virtue of what you ‚Äô re trying to do , it ‚Äô s going to be hard . There are going to be moments of depression and difficulty . The important thing is to have a Wright Brothers (Part 2): partner or support network in place that can help pull you out of those difficult times. So shortly after they get home, their sister Catherine writes to their father complaining that ‚ÄúWe don't hear anything but flying machine from morning till night.‚Äù So clearly the enthusiasm was fully back. What they realize they ended are scientific calculations. All of the data they had been given on wind coefficients and wing angles was wrong. So they wanted to get even more data than what they were able to gather in the summer at KittyHawk. And so above their bike shop they build one of the world‚Äôs first wind tunnels. Not the first but it was ingenious in its ability to measure drag and lift. It was a box, 16 inches by 16 inches and six feet long, with a fan at one end and open at the other end. And they essentially built and tested a bunch of miniature gliders, they tested 38 different wing surfaces in winds of up to 27 miles per hour. And this allows them to speed run the process of calculating the proper wing curvature and angle. It‚Äôs slow and tedious and they‚Äôre often up past midnight running tests. It is of course reminiscent of Thomas Edison go back and listen to those episodes if you haven‚Äôt. But Edison reaches a point with the light bulb where he says okay, the only way to figure it out from here is to just test a bunch of substances until we find the right one that will act as a filament for the light bulb. And similarly they are at a point where they just need to test a bunch of different variations and this wind tunnel allows them to do that. And again, I think this is what allowed the Wright Brothers to succeed. It is the combination of passion and enthusiasm, which mostly comes from Orville, and really rational structured thought that comes from Wilbur. And you see that with this wind tunnel. Now, I told you that a lot of people were working on flying machines at the time, and they are all having a really rough time. And enthusiasm is actually waning. At a certain point people throw their hands up and say this is just a waste of time guys. Chief Engineer of the United States Navy, Rear Admiral George Melville writes in an article that year, ‚ÄúA calm survey of certain natural phenomena leads the engineer to pronounce all confident prophecies for future success as wholly unwarranted, if not absurd. Where, even to this hour, are we to look for the germ of the successful flying machine?‚Äù At the same", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/wright-brothers-part-2", "title": "Wright Brothers (Part 2)", "chunk_index": 1, "publication_date": "2023-10-31", "total_chunks_in_doc": 19}}

Where , even to this hour , are we to look for the germ of the successful flying machine ? ‚Äù At the same Wright Brothers (Part 2): time, there is this guy Chanute. He had tried to be an aviation pioneer himself and it had never quite worked out. And he had become friendly with the brothers and now he tried to convince them that they were on better track than anyone else, and they should forget the bicycle business and go all-in. He says, you know, I‚Äôm friends with Andrew Carnegie, can I just raise a couple million from him and convince you guys to quit your jobs? And they turn him down. They like the independence that comes with working with their own money. Well they improve their glider with the calculations that they make from the wind tunnel and in 1902 return to Kitty Hawk with this new, improved glider. For one thing this glider is much bigger, the wings measuring 32 feet by 5 feet. And they have the opposite experience from 1901. It immediately becomes clear that their wind tunnel had yielded good calculations and this glider flies really really well. On October 2nd in North Carolina they stay up late talking about theory and designs and Orville accidentally drinks too much coffee. And so when everyone goes to bed, he‚Äôs just laying in bed tossing and turning. And while he‚Äôs awake in the middle of the night thinking, he has an idea: What if the rear rudder was movable. So up to this point they are just manipulating the wings, and this would give them an extra dimension of control. In the morning, Orville tells one of their companions, check this out. I‚Äôm about to tell Wilbur something and I guarantee you we get into an argument about it. Wilbur was the Steve Jobs of the group, he loved to attack an idea just to make you defend it and see if it was really a good idea. So Orville tells him the movable rudder idea, and winks at his friend and gets ready for the confrontation. And Wilbur sits there and thinks about it for a few seconds, and says, that‚Äôs actually a really great idea. Well this was the last major control issue they needed to figure out. With the movable rudder, they are soon able to make glides of more than 600 feet. And it‚Äôs not just the distance that matters, it‚Äôs what they could do for that 600 feet.

{"text": "now from The Wright Brothers by David McCullough : ‚Äú They could soar , they could float , they could dive and rise , circle and glide and land , all with assurance . ‚Äù As they closed up the gliding season for 1902 , they were truly able to Wright Brothers (Part 2): fully control their glider. All that was left was to add a power source. In the Bible, in Genesis chapter 6 verse 1, it says ‚ÄúThere were giants in the earth in those days‚Äù And that is what I think of when I think of the United States of America in the early 1900s. It was just full of brilliant innovators. Turn over a rock and you might find a genius. Well it turns out that one such genius was right under the brother‚Äôs noses. And his name was Charlie Taylor. Charlie was a first-rate mechanic. He lived close by in Dayton and he had been introduced to the brothers by a business associate, their landlord actually. He was a very good employee. Trustworthy, proactive, and mechanically extremely gifted. And as the brothers were spending more and more of their time working on flight, they turned over more and more of the operations of the bike shop to Charlie until he was basically running the thing. So Charlie was this trusted business associate, who they knew was a great machinist, and he would be the one to build their motor. First they try to reach out to existing engine manufacturers. People building gasoline engines for automobiles and tractors. And they reach out to ask if they have anything meeting certain specifications. And essentially what the brothers needed was something that could give decent output, but the really important thing was that it be a very light engine. And all of the engine manufacturers come back saying ‚Äúsorry, no can do.‚Äù This is nothing like what we build. So they ask Charlie if he can do it. Now keep in mind, Charlie worked on bikes. The entirety of his experience with gasoline engines was that a friend had asked him a couple years previous if he could help repair his broken car engine. So they give Charlie the lightest of instructions. They give him a few rough sketches and tell him it needs to be no more than 200 pounds and deliver 8 horsepower. And using the same metal lathe and drill press that they use to manufacture bicycles, he builds an engine that delivers 20 horsepower and weighs only 150 pounds. And he does this, builds an engine that meets their specifications even though he has never built or really even worked on an engine before, in just six weeks. Absolutely remarkable.

He was kind of a character , he smoked 25 cigars a day and constantly provoked and fought with Wright Brothers (Part 2): their sister Katherine. No one really knew who he was then, and now. And that didn‚Äôt bother him. He thought the brothers gave him plenty of credit. He later said in an interview, speaking of the Wrights: ‚ÄúThey appreciated that I had a part in giving the airplane to the world, though nobody made any fuss about it, and I didn't either.‚Äù I think he deserves to be more well known. I‚Äôm not saying the Wright Brothers are overrated or that he is the real genius of flight or anything like that. Just that he also played a pivotal role, one that is today mostly forgotten. Well with an engine built, the last thing to figure out was the propellers. And they were a doozy. Wilbur and Orville obsessed about the propellers day and night. In one incident, they get into a heated shouting match, each telling the other one that he was completely wrong. Catherine cries out, nearly hysterical ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt stop arguing. I‚Äôll leave home.‚Äù The next morning at 7 AM when Charlie opens up the shop, Orville comes in and tells Charlie that he thinks he‚Äôd been wrong, and they ought to do it Will‚Äôs way. A few minutes later Wilbur comes through the door and says ‚ÄúPerhaps Orv was right.‚Äù Well they come to an agreement on the propellers and on March 23rd, apply for a patent on their flying machine. By the summer, they think that everything is set. The brothers are pretty well convinced that they have their flying machine. That year on October 7th 1903, one of their biggest competitors attempts to beat them to the punch. He was the head of the Smithsonian and had raised seventy thousand dollars to build his flying machine. By contrast, the Wrights had spent less than a thousand dollars total on theirs. Langley had built his in secret, and was set to unveil it at a big event where it would fly. It was enormous and clunky looking. Langley invites observers and journalists and hundreds of people show up to watch the launch. After hours of anticipation, Langley announces the launch. It takes off, and promptly drives straight down into the Potomac. He regroups and tries a second flight on December 8th, and if anything the attempted flight goes even worse. He‚Äôs completely pilloried in the press. He becomes a laughing stock. And the Wright brothers never took an opportunity to rub it in his face In fact, Wilbur said that the presses treatment of Langley was ‚ÄúShameful.

And the Wright brothers never took an opportunity to rub it in his face In fact , Wilbur said that the presses treatment of Langley was ‚Äú Shameful . His work Wright Brothers (Part 2): deserved neither abuse nor apology.‚Äù In the meantime, the brothers were in Kitty Hawk getting ready to test a flying machine of their own. All of their tests and calculations suggested that success was likely. But there was a big difference between the wind tunnel and the actual open skies. We will hear about the Wright Brothers pivotal flying tests of 1903, after this quick break. *** AD BREAK *** During the flying season of 1903, the brothers worked their way up slowly, as they usually did. They spent weeks gliding just to make sure that the wings of the plane were still in working order and to get some practice. They wanted to make sure that they were accustomed to steering before attempting the first flight. On December 11th, 1903, Wilbur attempted the first flight. They started the engines, and Wilbur climbed aboard. It took off and he surged into the cold winter air. Almost immediately, he pulled to hard on the rudder, sending the flyer upward, before it lost lift and plunged down. The glider hit the sand only 100 feet from the starting point. The attempted flight was a failure, but the brothers were actually elated. Everything had worked just how they wanted to. There were no obvious failures in the engine or propeller. The only mistake had been Wilbur‚Äôs. He was unused to flying with the extra weight and had overcompensated. But this could be easily corrected on the next attempted flight. The plane took two days to repair and another attempt wasn‚Äôt made until December 16th. This time, Orville would be at the controls. Conditions tended to get blustery in the winter, and the weather was not cooperative. Winds of up to 27 miles per hour were blowing on that day. The flier used a track to launch. And as it slid down the track, Wilbur ran beside the right wing of the flier. The wind slowed it down enough that Wilbur had no trouble keeping up. It was slow going, but at the end of the track, the plane lifted, and Orville was flying. The ride was rough. It bucked up and down in heavy turbulence for the entire flight. And then it was over. It only lasted twelve seconds and 120 feet. When later asked if he was scared during the first flight, Orville smilingly responded ‚ÄúThere wasn‚Äôt time.‚Äù The boys went in to warm their hands by the fire, and then resumed attempting flights later that morning. The next flight went 175 feet, the third went 200.

The next flight went 175 feet , the third went 200 . And then finally at about noon , on Wright Brothers (Part 2): the fourth test Wilbur flew 852 feet over the ground in 59 seconds. A twelve second flight could be doubted. But a one minute flight couldn‚Äôt be. And even more impressively, he had complete control of the plane the entire time. One of their local North Carolina assistants, John T Daniels, later recalled ‚ÄúI like to think about that first airplane, the way it sailed off in the air, as pretty as any bird you ever laid eyes on. I don't think I ever saw a prettier sight in my life.‚Äù The brothers and their companions got together and began to plan a flight to the lifeguard station on the beach when the wind snatched the untethered flier, and flipped it end over end.It was a total wreck, nearly all the ribs of the wings were broken. But even the accident couldn‚Äôt dampen their spirits. They knew the flyer could easily be rebuilt. Soon, back in Dayton, Bishop Wright received a telegram. ‚ÄúSuccess. Four flights Thursday morning. All against 21 mile wind. Started from level. With engine power alone. Average speed through air, 31 miles per hour. Longest, 59 seconds. INform press. Home for Christmas. Orville Wright.‚Äù There have been a lot of other flyers who claim to have had the first flight, but this was the first flight of a piloted machine to take off under its own power into the air in full flight, maintained air speed, and landed at a point as high as that from which it started. It was a flight by every possible definition. The broken flyer was put into storage and was never flown again. It had one mission. Take man into the air under his own power for the first time. And that was all it did. The brothers and their family begin to notify the press, but no one takes any notice. Frank Tennyson of the AP, and also the Dayton Daily Journal, read the telegram and showed no interest, saying ‚Äú59 seconds, hey? If it had been 59 minutes, then it might have been a news item.‚Äù What actually does get them some press is a fake story. One of the telegraph operators had told a friend who was an aviation enthusiast and he concocts this fake story that say that it had one propeller on bottom for upward thrust and one propeller on back for forward thrust. And he says that they flew to 60 feet and that they flew for three miles over hills and waves, and Wilbur‚Äôs first words upon Orville‚Äôs return were ‚ÄúEureka!‚Äù", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/wright-brothers-part-2", "title": "Wright Brothers (Part 2)", "chunk_index": 6, "publication_date": "2023-10-31", "total_chunks_in_doc": 19}}

And he says that they flew to 60 feet and that they flew for three miles over hills and waves , and Wilbur ‚Äô s first words upon Orville ‚Äô s return were ‚Äú Eureka ! ‚Äù Wright Brothers (Part 2): So this obviously fake account gets carried in the New York Times and Washington Post, but nothing happens as a consequence, probably because most people could tell it was fake. One person in Boston does recognize the importance of the announcement, and tries to get the brothers put in touch with the war department in Washington DC but the army completely blows them off and don‚Äôt take them seriously. Even back home in Dayton, 99% of people think that they are exaggerating. And life goes on as normal. And so at the start of the year of 1904, the brothers slip back into work at the bike shop. And they alone are the keepers of this secret. So in 1904 they quietly set about building a new flyer. This one is heavier and more sturdy than the 1903 model with a more powerful and efficient engine. And they decide that they are not going to return to North Carolina anymore. The flyer can fly under its own power now, they don‚Äôt really need the wind that North Carolina provides. They find a field just outside of Dayton that belonged to a farmer named Torrence Huffman. And he allows them to rent his field, but he doesn‚Äôt believe in them at all, and tells a neighboring farmer that the boys are quote ‚Äúfools.‚Äù And at first he seemed to be right. WIthout the North Carolina wind, the boys struggle to get back in the air. Their first test flight is scheduled for May 23rd, but they don‚Äôt actually get off the ground for a real flight until August 13th, Wilbur finally gets off the ground and flies more than a thousand feet. Part of the problem was the starting distance. The field wasn‚Äôt that big, they didn‚Äôt have a huge runway. And so they needed to get more power at the start. So they designed a simple catapult system that essentially launched them off a little ramp. And with the catapult in place, they were able to fly more tha half a mile, and on September 14th, 1904, Wilbur managed to turn in a half circle, the first time it had ever been done. And so all through 1904 these test flights are happening right by Dayton and no one notices. In fact a major station of the commuter trolley was right by the field. And none of these commuters notice that humans are flying right over their heads.

He‚Äôs a huge enthusiast for driving and automobiles and he loves the idea of flight. He hears about what they‚Äôre doing and he writes to them and asks if he can come watch. And initially they basically say ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll let you know.‚Äù Basically don‚Äôt call us we‚Äôll call you. But he persists, he keeps writing them. At one point writing ‚ÄúExcuse me friends, but I am so anxious to see that airship, I can hardly sleep at night.‚Äù So eventually they relent and let him come down and watch. He lived further north in Ohio. And he gets to see the first complete circle ever flown. And this is what he writes. He‚Äôs a very excitable character, you can‚Äôt help but love him. Here‚Äôs a few quotes from his article about the incident: ‚ÄúGod in his great mercy has permitted me to be at least somewhat instrumental in ushering in and introducing to the great wide world an invention that may outrank electric cars and automobiles, and may fairly take a place beside the telephone and wireless telegraphy. ‚ÄúWhen it first turned that circle and came near the starting point, I was right in front of it. And I said then, and I believe still, it was one of the grandest sights, if not the grandest sight, of my life.‚Äù And you might be asking yourself, where did he write this? Well Amost Wright was a successful entrepreneur who had become rich manufacturing and selling bee-keeping equipment. And he had started a magazine called Gleanings in Bee Culture. So the first credible eye-witness account of powered manned flight appeared in Gleanings in Bee Culture. Just an amazing historical fact. Root sent his article to a more reputable magazine, The Scientific American, and told them it could be reprinted at no charge. They declined, and instead, their next article about flight was published a full year later and it was titled ‚ÄúThe Wright Aeroplane and Its Fabled Performances.‚Äù And the article basically says, these guys are full of it.

{"text": "article about flight was published a full year later and it was titled ‚Äú The Wright Aeroplane and Its Fabled Performances . ‚Äù And the article basically says , these guys are full of it . They say , you ‚Äô re telling me that these guys are actually flying Wright Brothers (Part 2): and they just can‚Äôt convince anyone to go check it out? Now this really makes the press out to be the bad guys, I should note that when the Wright Brothers first started test flights in May of 1904, a bunch of Dayton journalists had showed up to cover the flights. But that was when they were having their issues with takeoff. And so all they saw was a dud, they saw the brothers unable to fly, so that might explain some of the skepticism. But I mean, by October of 1904, the brothers are flying circles, s-curves, they had flown in calms and in winds, it was fully controllable, could fly in almost any conditions. I mean, they had an airplane. And they can‚Äôt get any interest. Their first interest actually comes from across the pond. The British military expresses interest. But the Wright Brothers are very patriotic, so they reject the offer, refuse to show the officer any test flights, and write to the War Department and once again offer to build planes for them. And once again they are rejected out of hand by the US military. And so they decide to go back to the British military and re-engaged. Wilbur writes ‚ÄúIt has for years been our business practice to sell to those who wish to buy, instead of trying to force goods upon people who did not want them. If the American government has decided to spend no more money on flying machines till their practical use has been demonstrated in actual service abroad, We are sorry, but we cannot reasonably object.‚Äù In 1905, they make even more improvements, and make a truly practical airplane for the first time. The 1904 was a real flyer that could consistently take people for flights, but the 1905 flyer could actually get you places. You no longer had to lay down, you could sit in it. It‚Äôs even sturdier and has a more powerful engine, and they are flying more than 15 miles at a time. This is actually the first time that they begin to write about how much they enjoy flying. I think before it was such a harrowing experience that they were just focused on accomplishing their mission. And you‚Äôre laying down on the glider. Now they write: ‚ÄúThe sensation is so keenly delightful as to be almost beyond description. Nobody who has not experienced it for himself can realize it. It is the realization of a dream so many persons have had of floating in the air.

{"text": "be almost beyond description . Nobody who has not experienced it for himself can realize it . It is the realization of a dream so many persons have had of floating in the air . More than anything else , the sensation is one of perfect peace , mingled with Wright Brothers (Part 2): the excitement that strains every nerve to the utmost, if you can conceive of such a combination.‚Äù So all throughout 1905 they are improving their ability to fly with the Wright Flyer, and they are in talks with the British government and then with the French government as well. In 1906, they actually enter into serious discussions over an agreement with the French government, and the general idea is that the French will pay them 1 million francs, worth 200 thousand dollars, for a single flyer, provided that they agree to come to France to conduct demonstrations, train pilots, and the machine has to meet certain requirements around altitude, distance, and speed. And it‚Äôs really the Wrights entering agreements with the French that starts to wake up the American press. This is when they really start to notice. The French, by contrast, are incredibly hard on the Wrights. The French were aviation nuts. It was a total phenomenon in France. And you have all of these aviation pioneers who are doing their own pioneering work. The Paris Herald writes an article entitled ‚ÄúFlyers or Liars‚Äù and they write ‚ÄúThe Wrights have flown or they have not flown. They possess a machine or they do not possess one. They are in fact either flyers or liars. It is difficult to fly. It is easy to say we have flown.‚Äù And part of the suspicion comes from the fact that now that the Wrights are entering contracts to sell their planes, they begin to clam up and get secretive. No more public flights or demonstrations, no more reaching out to the press. So on May 18th 1907, Wilbur goes to Europe. He is joined by Hart Berg, a Jewish American whose firm had contracted with the Wrights to sell their flyers in Europe. And I think the Wrights were smart to partner with an outside firm that had expertise in selling to foreign governments. It‚Äôs a very complex sale. There are politics involved, and conflicting interests even within these governments. they want to see the plane as is their right before they buy it, but they don't want to give away any secrets. So you know, it's a little touchy. And Berg proves to be very valuable, but Wilbur also proves to be a great salesman. He‚Äôs not slick or smooth-talking like Berg, but he is very direct, and he comes across as intelligent, reasonable, and honest. He comes across as the kind of person that you would want to do business with.

The idea is brought to him to pay a bribe to Wright Brothers (Part 2): speed things up with the French and he won‚Äôt even consider it. But as they negotiate further and further, it becomes clear that the French aren‚Äôt actually going to do anything until the Wrights can demonstrate their flyer in France. And by this time, there is a Brazilian-born French aviator named Alberto Santos-Dumas who is flying and one who is even further along named Henri Farman. And Farman can actually fly in a circle, and in the meantime, the Wrights aren‚Äôt demonstrating their plane. So it looks like they are getting passed to the general public. Now in reality, Farman‚Äôs plane is nowhere near as good as the Wright Flyer. But only the Wrights really know that for the time being. So this whole thing takes a long time but finally in 1908 they get an agreement with the French, which spurs the US government who follow behind and sign an agreement that same year. So the Wright Brothers go back to the US and they actually go back to North Carolina one last time to practice flying. They hadn‚Äôt flown since 1905 at this point, so they need the practice, and they‚Äôre reluctant to do it in front of a crowd so they‚Äôre trying to practice flying basically in secret by going to the Outer Banks which were at the time very remote and hard to visit. Well this doesn‚Äôt quite work, reporters flock to Kitty Hawk to see them. So the brothers practice, but they intentionally keep their flights short. THey don‚Äôt want to pull the rabbit out of the hat quite yet. Wilbur is just a great salesman by virtue of who he is. So, he does his first interview, and this guy is very reluctant. He's a Frenchman, um, writing for a French newspaper. And, this is what he writes. Mr. Hart O Berg warmed up for the interview by offering me a cup of coffee and laid out a box of cigars. I felt my doubts fly away one by one in the blue smoke. Through curls of smoke, I examined Wilbur Wright. His thin, serious face, lit by the strangely gentle, intelligent, and radiant eyes. I had to admit, I had to admit, no, this man was not a bluffer. So in the summer of 1908, Wilbur returns to France.

He needs to find a place to actually fly the thing , obviously Paris doesn ‚Äô t have many open fields , but he gets an attractive offer from a guy named Leon Bollet . He ‚Äô s a successful industrialist and Wright Brothers (Part 2): he has a factory and a big open field in a nearby town called Le Mans. So Wilbur accepts his offer to help and goes to Les Mans. Well, when he gets there he opens the crate with the flyer shipped from the US, only to realize that the French had completely mangled the thing in customs. It‚Äôs basically going to need to be rebuilt. Wilbur tries to employ some of Bollet‚Äôs French workers who were enthusiastic but ultimately not very skilled. So day after day, Wilbur Wright rebuilds the airplane by himself in Bollet‚Äôs factory. He lives in very spartan conditions, he actually sleeps in a shed with the airplane, he‚Äôs so worried about people breaking in to sabotage or spy on or even just take a peek at his plane. Finally, on August 8th, he decides that the plane is ready. Wilbur could never be rushed. As locals saw him making preparations on the field, they began to fill into the grandstands to watch what was happening. He wore no helmet, no uniform, no special aviation clothing, he wore his normal gray suit that he always wore. The people are waiting from the early morning, watching for anything to happen, but Wilbur is in no rush. At three in the afternoon, he finally wheels the thing out onto the racetrack, and then proceeds to check it over and fiddle with it for three and a half hours while the crowd watches impatiently. His sales guy, Berg, would later recall ‚ÄúNeither the impatience of waiting crowds, nor the sneers of rivals, nor the pressure of financial conditions, not always easy, could induce him to hurry over any difficulty before he had done everything in his power to understand and overcome it.‚Äù Well at six thirty PM on August 8th, with the sun just starting to set, Wilbur turned his cap backward, and walks over to Berg, Bollet, and those around them, and quietly but confidently says ‚ÄúGentleman, I‚Äôm going to fly.‚Äù He started the engine and propellers. Sat in the seat. Asked a mechanic if a certain adjustment had been made. He then left his seat to check for himself to make sure the adjustment was indeed made to his satisfaction. Then he sat back down, and took off. The flight lasted for a little less than two minutes during which he traveled a little more than two miles. The French crowd absolutely lose their minds.

One of the French pilots who had conducted his own test flights, who had been waiting around since the morning, told a reporter ‚ÄúI would have waited ten times longer to have seen what i have seen today.‚Äù Another French aviator told a newspaper ‚ÄúWe are children compared to the Wrights.‚Äù Skepticism disappeared over night. Newspapers all over Europe and the United States carried headlines declaring it a triumph. Le Matin writes ‚ÄúThe mystery which seemed inextricable and inexplicable is now cleared away. Wright flew with an ease such that one cannot doubt those enigmatic experiments that took place in America. No more than one can doubt that this man is capable of remaining an hour in the air. It is the most extraordinary vision of a flying machine that we have seen.‚Äù And they hit the nail on the head there on what made the demonstration so special. It wasn‚Äôt the height or the speed or the duration or the or any one of those measurable technical milestones that impressed people. It was the control. Other aviators who took to the air always looked like they were on the verge of death. They were just trying to keep their plane aloft long enough to set some new record. Wilbur‚Äôs flight, on the other hand, looked smooth and fully in control. This was a plane not meant for arbitrary records, as others were, but the French immediately grasped that this was the only plane around that could produce consistent, safe, practical flights. And Wilbur becomes a huge celebrity in France overnight. Not that he lets it affect him at all. He changes not at all, and basically refuses to acknowledge his celebrity status. When crowds are gathered outside his window in Le Mans, he will occasionally come out to the balcony and wave to them. That is the extent of his playing into the hype. Neither Wilbur nor Orville ever married in their life. But I don‚Äôt think their story lacks a love interest. I think the love story of the Wright Brothers was between Wilbur Wright and France. On days when Wilbur wasn‚Äôt working, he wandered the Louvre and took in the Tuileries. He was incredibly well read and had a great grasp of art, literature, and history.

He is sure of himself, and of his genius.‚Äù My favorite interaction actually is when Wilbur is awarded a gold medal from the French Aero Club. The presenter says in part: ‚ÄúMr. Wright is a man who has never been discouraged, even in the face of hesitation and suspicion. The brothers Wright have written their names in human history as inventors of pronounced genius.‚Äù And then Wilbur gets up and gives a speech, and in part of it says how much the French have meant to them. ‚ÄúFor myself and my brother, I thank you for the honor you are doing us, and for the cordial reception you have tendered us this evening. If I had been born in your beautiful country and had grown up among you, I could not have expected a warmer welcome than has just been given me. When we did not know each other, we had no confidence in each other. Today, when we are acquainted, it is otherwise. We believe each other and we are friends. I thank you for this. In the enthusiasm being shown around me, I see not merely an outburst intended to glorify a person. But a tribute to an idea that has always impassioned mankind. I sometimes think that the desire to fly after the fashion of birds is an ideal handed down to us by our ancestors who, in their grueling travels across trackless lands and prehistoric times, looked enviously on the birds soaring freely through space at full speed, above all obstacles, on the infinite highway of the air. Scarcely ten years ago, all hope of flying had almost been abandoned. Even the most convinced had become duped, doubtful. And I confess that, in 1901, I said to my brother, Orville, that men would not fly for fifty years. Two years later, we ourselves were making flights. This demonstration of my inability as a prophet gave me such a shock, that I have ever since distrusted myself and have refrained from all prediction, as my friends of the press especially well know. But it is not really necessary to look too far into the future. We see enough already to be certain that it will be magnificent. Only let us hurry and open the roads.

{"text": ", I thank you with all my heart . And in thanking you , I should like it understood that I am thanking all of France . ‚Äù Over the coming three months , Wilbur flew demonstration after demonstration . And thousands of people flocked to Les Mans to see Wright Brothers (Part 2): each one. And the details of his existence in Les Mans are quite charming. A stray dog starts following him around which he eventually adopts and names flyer. The boys from Les Mans also follow him around. And they are the only ones who can pronounce his name. Everyone else in France calls him Monsieur Wreecht. But they have learned to pronounce his name and they call him Monsieur Wright. On August 25th, 1908, the city of Les Mans throws him a massive banquet to celebrate his accomplishments and his contributions to the city of Les Mans. The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche referred to the French as having a feminine culture. And what he meant by that is that they take the ideas of people from elsewhere and incubate them and cherish them. So the great example is Da Vinci, right? He was not truly appreciated in Italy, but the French truly recognized Da Vinci as a genius, they celebrated him, they enabled him, they did whatever they could do encourage his genius. And the French did much the same thing with the Wrights. I find it to be one of the most charming things about French culture that they do this. Well while Wilbur was carrying on his love affair with France, Orville was getting ready to conduct demonstrations in Washington DC for the US War Department, which had finally woken up to the Wright‚Äôs accomplishments after Wilbur‚Äôs triumphs in France. Because Wilbur has already been flying in France, the reactions to Orville‚Äôs demonstrations are a little more muted, but not much. Thousands of people flock to the see the flights. It‚Äôs a huge phenomenon and an enormous popular success for the Wright brothers. He pushes his flyer a little harder than Wilbur, and keeps setting records, mostly for time in the air. His longest flight is an hour and six minutes. A pretty big leap from the twelves seconds of his first flight. But his pushing of the limits eventually has consequences. On September 17th 1908, for the first time in nine years of flying, a Wright flying machine experiences a malfunction, and Orville and his passenger, a handsome and ambitious young luitenant named Thomas Selfridge, suddenly dive from an altitude of 100 feet. Selfridge was killed, and Orville was badly injured. He had broken his leg, his hip, and four ribs. He‚Äôs badly shaken, and it takes a long time for him to fully recover. His sister Katherine is a hero at this time, and stays by his bed day and night to care for Orville and help nurse him back to health. Eventually, Katherine and Orville", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/wright-brothers-part-2", "title": "Wright Brothers (Part 2)", "chunk_index": 15, "publication_date": "2023-10-31", "total_chunks_in_doc": 19}}
{"text": "badly shaken , and it takes a long time for him to fully recover . His sister Katherine is a hero at this time , and stays by his bed day and night to care for Orville and help nurse him back to health . Eventually , Katherine and Orville Wright Brothers (Part 2): go out to France where the join Wilbur. They keep putting on demonstrations in France, and also in Italy and Germany. When they all finally come back to America together, they are greeted in Dayton with the largest parade that the city had ever seen. More than ten thousand people come just to meet them at the train station before the actual celebration. There is a parade, speeches, marching bands, concerts, they are presented with the keys to the city. And amazingly, during these two euphoric days of celebration, the brothers from time to time, manage to slip back into their old bike shop to get some work done. ‚Ä¶ Making money had never been the point for the brothers, but their initial sales to the French and American governments had made the Wrights rich men. They did eventually start a company called, unsurprisingly, the Wright Company. They manufacture airplanes, as you might imagine. But they honestly spend about as much time enforcing their patents as they do on actual manufacturing. Wilbur died of typhoid fever at only age 45 on May 30th, 1912. Orville would live until 1948, when he died of a heart attack. Orville sold the Wright Company in 1908, and it merged a couple times until it became the Curtiss-Wright company. It still exists today and manufactures parts for airplanes. The company has a market cap of about $7.5 billion. And as successful of a company as it is, that is not their main legacy and was never supposed to. The Wright brothers did not undertake the project of powered flight to make money. They did it to fly. Just to fly. It‚Äôs amazing to think that just two hundred years ago no one had flown. Absolutely nobody. And now in large part because of the Wright Brothers, we are an airborne species. So what can we learn from the Wright Brothers? I think there is so much, so I‚Äôll just key in on a few ideas: The first is this commitment to not change from what got you there. Even when the brothers were receiving ecstatic celebrations in Dayton and France and across the world, their true desire was to quietly get back to work. Even at their big celebration in Dayton they are slipping back into their bike shop. It reminds me of Genghis Khan. I think the main thing that separated him from other steppe conquerors is that he was never seduced by the empires that he conquered. He slept in a Mongolian tent until the day he died. He never gave up his original way of life. So Genghis Khan and the", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/wright-brothers-part-2", "title": "Wright Brothers (Part 2)", "chunk_index": 16, "publication_date": "2023-10-31", "total_chunks_in_doc": 19}}

He never gave up his original way of life . So Genghis Khan and the Wright Brothers (Part 2): Wright Brothers are alike in that way. It also reminds me of the Rothschild brothers who never lost their love of finance even as they became enormously wealthy. Okay lesson two is that constraints improve performance. The Wrights were smart not to take endless amounts of funding from Andrew Carnegie. They ended up spending something like 1% what Langley spent on his failed monstrosity of a glider. And I think that their frugal budget actually helped them. When money is no object, sometimes you tend to overlook things, whereas when you are on a shoestring budget you are by necessity intimately familiar with every detail of the project you‚Äôre working on. So I think it is often the best policy to do what the Wrights did. To stay lean, stay hungry, and operate within helpful constraints, financial or otherwise. Of course there are unhelpful constraints as well, no one is saying you need to compete with an arm tied behind your back but especially when it comes to money I think frugality forces creativity. Third is to break down problems and solve them piece by piece. I think it‚Äôs overwhelming to think about how you would create the first powered flying machine from scratch. But if you break down the problem into its parts: Balance, lift, and power, then it starts to seem more approachable. We just design a glider for the lift, add some controls for the balance, and then we just need to add a light weight power source at the end. And that‚Äôs exactly what they did. And so when you are up against a really problem, that seems impossibly difficult, just break it down. What are the individual pieces I actually need to solve here. And then don‚Äôt solve them all at once, solve them one by one if you can, just like the Wright brothers did. And my fourth takeaway is just that anything is possible. This episode made me so proud to be an American. And I was so proud of the Wright brothers for the grit and determination that they demonstrated. Everyone around them was failing, for a time they were failing. And at a time when everyone was saying that it was impossible and that even if it were possible, they were not the ones to do it. They didn‚Äôt know what they were talking about it. They just put their heads down and did it anyway.

{"text": "Gerard Manley Hopkins: Hello, and welcome to how to take over the world. This is Ben Wilson, and this week is a mini episode as I'm working on full length episodes for Catherine, the great and Alexander the great, but I wanted to share a quick thought, give you a mini episode between now and then, but first a word from our sponsors. So I've been thinking a little bit about my favorite poet, Gerard Manley Hopkins. And in this mini episode, I just want to bring up one small aspect of his life. Hopkins was born in Stratford, England in 1844. He studied at Oxford where he realized that he had an incredible gift for poetry. Hopkins was just this unbelievable poet.He had just an incredible command of the English language. And if you read his stuff, it's unlike the poetry of anyone else it's incredibly lyrical and fun to read. I thinkand he's not just one of my favorite poets. He's also considered by critics to be one of the great poets. He has a moral in Westminster, Abbey and poet's corner next to the likes of Shakespeare and Jane Austin and Ts Elliot. And if you read Hopkins' poetry, you would think that he only created masterpieces because truly, almost every single one of his poems is a true masterpiece. . And that's because of one simple reason. And that's that he burned all the rest of it.He was bipolar, uh, and he would have these just terrible depressive episodes. this depression was probably exacerbated by the fact that he was a gay man during a time when that was not tolerated in English society. And in one of those depressive episodes, He burned all of his poetry, all the poetry that he ever wrote, he burned all of it. And the only reason that we're able to read anything is that he had sent some of his very best stuff to some of his friends who were pellets.And they could tell that it was great and they published it after his death. , but we don't have, you know, who knows, we don't know how much he wrote, but in all likelihood, we don't have 80 to 90% of the poetry that he ever wrote. Now, if you're an aspiring poet, think of the impression that this gives you. If you don't know his backstory, you start reading this guy's stuff and you think my goodness, like this guy is a genius.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/gerard-manley-hopkins", "title": "Gerard Manley Hopkins", "chunk_index": 0, "publication_date": "2020-06-12", "total_chunks_in_doc": 3}}
{"text": ". Now , if you ' re an aspiring poet , think of the impression that this gives you . If you don ' t know his backstory , you start reading this guy ' s stuff and you think my goodness , like this guy is a genius . Gerard Manley Hopkins: He only wrote 10 out of 10 amazing life changing poems.And I know that I have written some stuff is not this good. I clearly don't have the talent this guys has, and I can, I can never approach it that you might be tempted to feel that way. You don't get to see all the mediocre and bad poetry that he wrote because it's lost the history. And I'm sure he did have some clunkers, but we'll just never know.And Hopkins is not alone. In this regard, Charles Dickens burned more than 20 years worth of letters, notes, and writing that didn't live up to his, you know, great standards, monet tore up and burned a number of his water.Lily paintings leaving only the best ones for posterity to enjoy and Marvel at. And again, this gives the wrong impression that they spent their careers laboring over a select few masterpieces. When the truth is the opposite, they were prolific artists who created volumes and volumes of work, much of it, fairly mediocre. But out of these volumes and volumes of work came a few masterpieces.and one of the things that reminded me of this was this week. I was reading a book called atomic habits by James clear, I recommend it. It's very good. And in it, he recounts the story of Jerry Yasmin, a famous photographer and professor of photography at the university of Florida. And at the beginning of one semester, professor Juelz men divided his class in half the left side of the class, he explained would be graded solely based on the number of photos they took. 100 photographs would rate an a 90 photographs would rate a B.And so on and so forth, . They would be graded solely on volume. And so they were dubbed the quantity group. the right side of the class would be graded differently.They would submit one single photo at the end of the semester and they could take it as long as they wanted. They could take as many or as few photographs as they wanted. But the important thing was. That they had to submit one, you know, masterpiece the very best work that they could manage and they would be graded based on the subjective rating of how great this photograph was.And so they were dubbed the quality group. And at the end of the semester, professor, the man looked through the photographs and he did sort of a blind test and selected kind of a few of the photographs that he thought were exceptional that", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/gerard-manley-hopkins", "title": "Gerard Manley Hopkins", "chunk_index": 1, "publication_date": "2020-06-12", "total_chunks_in_doc": 3}}
{"text": "was . And so they were dubbed the quality group . And at the end of the semester , professor , the man looked through the photographs and he did sort of a blind test and selected kind of a few of the photographs that he thought were exceptional that Gerard Manley Hopkins: he thought were great. And when he did this and looked up, you know, who actually had taken these photos, it turned out that all of the best photographs had come, not from the quality group.But from the quantity group They had spent the semester experimenting, trying new techniques, figuring out things that worked and that didn't work and giving themselves more bites at the Apple of taking a truly great photograph. Meanwhile, the quality group had spent their time researching theories, thinking about what makes a great photo and agonizing and vain over what they hoped would be this masterpiece, but it turned out was not. He later expressed the lesson he learned from this when he said many vices emphasize theory, but I felt strongly that producing images was most important and almost all greatness is like this. Whether it's an art war, business sports, or any other domain, , greatness belongs not to those who understand some abstract theory or who spend the most time tinkering on a single great work. But rather to those who make the most attempts, Thomas Edison was famous for saying, I have not failed 10,000 times.I have not failed once I have succeeded in proving that those 10,000 ways will not work when I have eliminated the ways that do not work, I will find the way that does work. So there you go. No person goes from unmitigated success to unmitigated success. everyone experiences failures, the important thing is you keep trying enough and produce enough volume that some great things can come out of what you do. So that's it for this week. Like I said, Catherine, the great Alexander, the great coming soon stay patient, who knows when. Until then.

{"text": "Mansa Musa: hello, and welcome to how to take over the world. This is Ben Wilson. If you Google, who is the richest man of all time, Mansa, Musa, his name is likely to pop up. He's remarkable for many reasons, but I think most interesting reason is that he's the only person that I know of, at least through history who had what I would describe as limitless amounts of money. If you've ever wondered what it would be like to just be able to conjure money out of thin air, , Mansa Musa has kind of the guy that can answer the question for you. Um, you think about the other extremely rich people of all time. You think about someone like Jeff Bezos today $170 billion is what he's worth. Last time I checked and, um, you know, it would be extremely difficult for Jeff Bezos to spend all his money, even if he tried. But you can't say it's limitless because that's not using very much imagination. I mean, think if, if he tried to exert anything like the kind of political or military control that, that men of his wealth did in the past, you know, Jeff Bezos would probably have a tough time spending down all his money if he were trying to buy cars and planes and houses. Um, but if you were trying to buy kingdoms and in land and the things that Julius Caesar or Charlemagne was buying with his money, he would find himself out of money pretty quick. But not Mansa Musa. Uh, this is a guy who really just had so much money that , the only things he didn't have were things that he could not buy So he's just sort of on a different level when it comes to that wealth. Um, that that's why people make the case for him as the richest man of all time. So who was this guy and how did he become so rich? Uh, let's find out, but first a word from our sponsors. the empire of Mali was founded in the year, 1235 in Western Africa by a man named Sundiata Kaita. The records are a little bit shaky about the early days of the empire. It wasn't until the 13 hundreds that the world at large started to understand the region. And we started to get reliable documentation histories, but we do know that Sundiata Kaita was a warrior Prince who led the battle to freed the Mali people from the rule of the ancient Ghanaian empire.

{"text": "that the world at large started to understand the region . And we started to get reliable documentation histories , but we do know that Sundiata Kaita was a warrior Prince who led the battle to freed the Mali people from the rule of the ancient Ghanaian empire . And Mansa Musa: as he did, so he expanded the power and territory of the Mali empire and crucially managed the secure access to the transparent trade routes. And those trade routes were everything. They were what connected Subsaharan Africa to the rest of the world. By the time Mansa Musa took over the empire covered about 500,000 square miles of West Africa extending all the way to the coast. They were able to tax trade going in and out of the region and become very wealthy as a result, the three big commodities of that day were gold, which was used as currency, obviously copper, which was used in bronze and in jewelry and had many different functions and salt, which was used for preserving and enhancing the taste of food. Luckily for the Mali empire, they had all three of these things in great abundance. The empire was the home of. In particular three massive gold mines, , and big salt mines too. Um, the Mali empire had access to a mine called Tagawa, and this was this crazy place. Nobody lived in the area except for the people who worked the mines. And there was like nothing in the area. So they ate imported dates and dried camel meat. And the buildings were literally constructed out of big slabs of salt that they were mining. Cause that's, that's all there was in the area. the salt would be dug up and cut into these really thick slabs and then strapped to a camel and. And sold for a huge markup. So between the salt mines and the gold mines, thrillers of the Mali empire had a license to print money and every incentive to continue doing. So, in fact, the world of the Mediterranean was short on gold at the time. So there was constant demand for it. And obviously these guys were happy to provide it. Moose, his predecessor as the King of Molly was a man by the name of AGU Barker. And despite his vast wealth Abu Barker was not particularly interested in the affairs of the empire or even in the world of West Africa, listen to Mansa Musa as quoted by Arab historian. Almari describe AGU backer and what he did. Mansa Musa said, quote, the ruler who proceeded me did not believe that it was impossible to reach the extremity of the ocean, that in circles, the earth, meaning the Atlantic ocean and wanted to reach that end and obstinately persisted in the design. So he equipped 200 boats full of men, many others, full of gold water and victuals sufficient enough for several years and ordered the chief Admiral not", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/mansa-musa", "title": "Mansa Musa", "chunk_index": 1, "publication_date": "2020-07-28", "total_chunks_in_doc": 9}}

So he equipped 200 boats full of men , many others , full of gold water and victuals sufficient enough for several years and ordered the chief Admiral not Mansa Musa: to return until they had reached the extremity of the ocean, or if they had exhausted the provisions and the water, they set out their absence extended over a long period. And at last only one boat returned on our questioning. The captain said, Prince, we have navigated for a long time, until we saw in the midst of the ocean as if a big river was flowing violent Prince, we have navigated for a long time, until we saw in the midst of the ocean as if a big river was flowing violently. My boat was the last one. Others were ahead of me. As soon as any of them reached this place. It drowned in the Whirlpool and never came out. I sailed backwards to escape this current, but the Sultan would not believe him. He ordered 2000 boats to be equipped for him and his men and 1000 more for water and victuals. Then he conferred on me, the Regency during his absence and departed with his men on the ocean trip, never returned, never to return nor to give a sign of life. so basically the predecessor to Mansa Musa hops on this boat and says, all right, you hold things down while I'm gone and disappears over the horizon. Never to be seen again. I love conspiracy theories and there's some good ones that he actually did reach the Americas. And to be fair, uh, there actually are reports that natives of some Caribbean islands had legends of black men from the South who arrived with massive amounts of copper and gold. And I find that somewhat compelling. , but the academic consensus is that they did not in fact ever arrive at the Americas. , for the simple reason that there has never been any concrete evidence found of any African artifacts in the new world before the Colombian exchange. So regardless of whether he actually reached the new world or not, it is certain that he never returned to West Africa. And when everyone back in Mali, hadn't heard from Abu Bachar in a year, Mussa became the official Monsa or King of the Mali empire. So when we say Mansa Musa, that literally just means King Mussa and Musa was not unprepared to become King. He had been biding his time waiting for it. And when that moment finally arrived, he was ready to act. So you mentioned Moosa doot with his vast new empire, with an army numbering around a hundred thousand men, including an armored cavalry Corps of 10,000 horses.

And using his talent at general , Sarah and Mundean Mansa Musa was able to extend and Mansa Musa: maintain Molly's vast empire. He wrestled control of the cities of Timbuktu and gal, which were rich and salt and gold. And this gave him control over even more important trade routes between the Mediterranean and West African coast. By the end of his reign moves ahead doubled the Empire's territory, making it second in size only to that of the Mongol empire at the time. Never again with the Mali empire, be as vast as it was during the months. And Rousseau's rain Musa was about much more than just expanding his territory though. He had to manage an extremely diverse empire with people of all different backgrounds, cultures, and religious beliefs. As a devout Muslim, he was initially inclined to impose Islam as the official religion, but listen to his people and actually implemented a quite progressive religious tolerance as compared to other empires at the time. But imagine your mentum Musab, you're a Muslim with an awareness of the Islamic world, but great difficulty in accessing it. You've basically expanded your empire to the greatest extent that is possible to reach given the technology at the time. , cause once you get to a certain distance, you hit the Sahara desert. And I think sometimes people don't understand what a great barrier that's a hard desert is. First of all, everyone knows, obviously it's extremely hot and dry. Temperatures can get up into the a hundred and twenties degrees Fahrenheit. And most of it receives less than an inch of rain per year away. Seas are very rare and it's extremely inhospitable to life. If you got dropped off in the Sahara desert, you would likely survive a couple days at most. But what I think sometimes people don't grasp about the Sahara desert is just how big it is. It's huge. It contains three and a half million square miles of desert. It's the largest hot desert in the world. And, um, I know that's a little difficult to conceptualize three and a half million square miles, but think of it like this, the city of Tunis is on the North African coast. So it's on the continent of Africa and right the coast of the Mediterranean sea. But to give you an idea of how big the Sahara desert is, Tunis is closer to Stockholm, Sweden than it is to the Ghanaian coast. So Cairo, the city in Egypt, uh, was at the time, the center of the Islamic world and Cairo.

Again , technically on the continent of Mansa Musa: Africa is closer to Copenhagen, London, Moscow, uh, even to India than it is to Timbuktu. Uh, or in other words to Mali where Mansa Musa was. There's just no barrier in the world. Quite like it it's this enormous desert. And it kept Subsaharan Africa basically completely isolated from the Mediterranean world and beyond for tens of thousands of years, by the time Mansa Musa came around, there were trade routes going over the Sahara. But it was a months long journey through the desert. So obviously only non perishable goods could be transported and it really limited contact still between the two areas. So if you're a wealthy, ambitious, young ruler, how do you continue to grow your empire and your influence beyond this fast desert? Well, what Mansa Musa decided to do would make him famous for generations. He decided to take the Hodge. The Hodge is a trip to the Holy city of Mecca that every Muslim is expected to make, at least once in their lifetime and Mansa Musa decides to make this Hodge in spectacular fashion. And this is one of those moments where just reading about it. I kind of get lost in the movie, in my head of what's going on. Imagine you're living in the 13 hundreds in Cairo, Egypt. It's a vibrant city. It's kind of, you know, at the center of the world, when you think about all these European and middle Eastern and Asian empires, they sort of all come together in Cairo. So it's very worldly, very international. Uh, it's the cultural capital of the Islamic world with stunning, artistic and architectural achievements, uh, incredible buildings, you know, all the greatest poets, all the greatest scholars, all, you know, everything is going on in Cairo. Living in Cairo back then is a, is a little bit like living in New York city today. Only more so right. And then one day a rumor of a city moving through the desert spreads throughout the Cairo. people talk of this, you know, golden moving city after much anticipation after weeks of hearing about it, it finally arrives. And what you see is even better than what you had been hearing. It's 60,000 people in total, all the newcomers are clad inexpensive silks and golden brewery from the Royal officials to the soldiers, to the entertainers and the merchants, even the slaves are wearing this incredible gold garb and men on horses are waiving gold banners. even the", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/mansa-musa", "title": "Mansa Musa", "chunk_index": 4, "publication_date": "2020-07-28", "total_chunks_in_doc": 9}}

Um, this thing is so overlaid with gold. They they're putting it on everything. They don't even know what to do with it. Each camel, there are a hundred camels that are Laden with 300 pounds of pure gold. So literally gold is just flowing from this caravan and they're walking through the city and they're just throwing it there. They're handing out left and right making charitable donations, giving as gifts. and at the helm of this whole extravagant procession. Is a man riding on a stallion dawning, a crown made a pure gold. If you've seen the Disney movie Aladdin, it's a lot like when Aladdin wishes to be Prince Ali. And as they marched through the street, Mansa Musa and his Royal associates are looking Regal and dignified as they give out all this gold. And, uh, it makes obviously a huge splash and creates this aura of mystique around this foreign King Mansa, Musa. And I say mystique, and that's because you know, this empire of Mali was not well known to the rest of the world. Like I said, even some places close as Cairo already on the continent of Africa was completely separated from Mali. Um, there's very little cultural contact between the two. And so it's really this mysterious man. Um, this Hodge was the event that literally put Molly on the map. Years later, a world map called the Catalan Atlas, which was commissioned by King Charles the fifth in 1375 included the first detailed map of West Africa. And in it lies a drawing of Mansa Musa. He's sitting on a throne, he's got a gold ball in one hand and a golden staff in the other. And if you Google Mansa, Musa, it's likely the first image you'll see. But before this, you know, West Africa was, was not really on the maps, certainly not in any detail. And after this, it was because he made such a Sur and it wasn't necessarily all a positive stir. The entourage ended up giving out so much gold and spending so much in the markets that the value of golden Cairo crashed by 20%. And it wasn't just Cairo. They accidentally devastated economies all along their path. Some estimate that this led to approximately a billion and a half dollars in economic losses throughout the middle East. and it took a decade to fully recover from this massive depreciation", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/mansa-musa", "title": "Mansa Musa", "chunk_index": 5, "publication_date": "2020-07-28", "total_chunks_in_doc": 9}}

Some estimate that this led to approximately a billion and a half dollars in economic losses throughout the middle East . and it took a decade to fully recover from this massive depreciation Mansa Musa: and the price of gold Moosa made such an impact on the Egyptians that 12 years later, when Syrian historian and writer Umar, he visited Cairo. He noted that people were still raving about him and his extravagant visit. And so you see why people call him the richest person of all time. You know, he's spending so much money, but it's devastating economies and it's still not putting a dent in what he has. Rudolph Butch where a West African history professor at UC Santa Barbara put it this way. He said, quote, contemporary accounts of moose as well are so breathless that it's almost impossible to get a sense. Of just how wealthy and powerful he truly was. where said, imagine as much gold as you think a human being could possess and double it. That's what all the accounts are trying to communicate, but Moosa didn't just inspire others by his vast displays of wealth. He was in turn inspired by what he saw in his journey. He was impressed by the universities and the architecture and the schools, the libraries that he saw in Cairo and devoted much of his reign to making his empire a robust center of scholarship. He picked up several poets, scholars, artists, and architects from all around the middle East. And brought them back to the Empire's prize, Juul, the city of Timbuktu, obviously his, uh, his vast wealth gave them plenty of motivation to relocate. And have you heard of the city of Timbuktu? It's usually as referring to a place that is extremely remote and far away, you know, Where does Susie live? Oh, she lives out in Timbuktu. That sort of thing. In reality, Timbuktu became a legendary city because of Mansa Musa. In fact, as late as the 18th century, European explorers were still venturing through the inhospitable Sahara to find this golden city in the desert. You know, it was kind of, the Eldorado, uh, for a time that people thought it was this golden city, that if they discovered it, have these vast treasures. Musa said about turning Timbuktu into a great urban center of learning religion, commerce, like he had seen in Cairo, he commissioned incredible mosques schools and libraries to be built. One of those magnificent mosques still stands to this day, over 600 years later. And he sent scholars out to cities all over the world to learn new things and bring them back for the people of Timbuktu to study. Timbuktu soon became an educational hub with people traveling", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/mansa-musa", "title": "Mansa Musa", "chunk_index": 6, "publication_date": "2020-07-28", "total_chunks_in_doc": 9}}
{"text": "those magnificent mosques still stands to this day , over 600 years later . And he sent scholars out to cities all over the world to learn new things and bring them back for the people of Timbuktu to study . Timbuktu soon became an educational hub with people traveling Mansa Musa: from around the world to study at what would become known as the sand core university. He encouraged literacy and scientific advancement. And one of the libraries housed hundreds of thousands of books and manuscripts. Mansa Musa really did manage to turn Timbuktu into a world class city. Unfortunately much of that history has been destroyed in recent years due to tribal conflicts and terrorist occupation in the area. But at the time it was a great center of religion, education, art, culture, and commerce. So what do we make of this, of the history of Mansa Musa? Which was his ultimate ambition and Mansa Musa spent the rest of the duration of his reign in his life, strengthening the kingdom and continuing to build up Timbuktu as this great city, this kind of Pearl, this prized Juul of his empire. Yeah. So what do we make of the story of Mansa Musa? What can we learn from it? It's easy to be cynical and say, you know, the lesson to be drawn from the life of Mansa Musa. Is be born on top of the world's largest gold mines and, uh, sure. Whatever. I guess there's some truth to that, but at the same time, think about this, his predecessors and his successors both had access to the same salt and gold mines. And yet no one has really ever heard of them. It's true. His wealth was mostly a function of his position of birth. Combined with some level obviously of strong leadership and enterprising spirit, But if his wealth can largely be explained as a matter of inheritance, what he did to Timbuktu can not be explained that way. He could have sailed off into the distance, like Abu Bachar or he could have virtually done nothing with his wealth, as many of his successors did, but instead he had a vision for this amazing city in the desert. And so I think that's one crucial lesson from the life of Mansa, Musa, his vision. Uh, the other important thing to point out was how he realized his vision, how he did it. Mansa Musa was able to realize his vision by turning gold, into actual influence and the way he did that was through spectacle. If he had just tried to hire, you know, the, the Islamic world's great poets from Cairo and Baghdad and Damascus, , to come to Timbuktu, they probably would have stopped and said, you know where, the middle of the desert, you know, someplace beyond the Sahara, we've never", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/mansa-musa", "title": "Mansa Musa", "chunk_index": 7, "publication_date": "2020-07-28", "total_chunks_in_doc": 9}}
{"text": "the Islamic world ' s great poets from Cairo and Baghdad and Damascus , , to come to Timbuktu , they probably would have stopped and said , you know where , the middle of the desert , you know , someplace beyond the Sahara , we ' ve never Mansa Musa: heard of yet. Right. But after the spectacle that he created on the Hodge, when everyone saw this unbelievably wealthy caravan, these sorts of people were intrigued and were much more willing to come to Timbuktu and see what was going on. I had the chance to chat with a bestselling author the other week. And I mean, like really best-selling he put out one of the top selling books in the world last year as a first time author. And I was asking him to what he attributed his success. And he said, you know, I, I think I wrote a great book obviously, but. One of the biggest things in making it this mega bestseller was the rollout. We had this huge rollout plan. , and I was everywhere in the media, did took every interview, , and just really emphasized creating a huge stir with this big rollout of the book. And it worked, it became a New York times bestseller. Again, it was one of the bestselling books in the world last year. And that's a little bit what Mansa Musa did too. Right? He could have tried to make regular trips to Egypt or Mecca to make himself a known presence in the Islamic world and become familiarized with those circles and have them familiarize with him. But what he did was actually much more effective to make one big trip that was completely unforgettable. So that's one thing you can contemplate after this episode, we all need good habits, of course, that we need to do every day. We all need to have big goals that we slowly work towards over time. Those are both great, of course, very important. But in addition, you should think about what your Hodge will be. How can you be like Mansa, Musa? What can you do that will demand attention and make yourself completely unforgettable. That does it for this episode of how to take over the world.

{"text": "Benjamin Franklin: Hello and welcome to How to Take Over the World. This is Ben Wilson. Today we are talking about Benjamin Franklin, the American inventor, writer, diplomat, entrepreneur, and statesman. Benjamin Franklin is an interesting character. I think he's often understood in kind of comic terms. He seems kind of ridiculous, and that's partially his own doing. He didn't take himself too seriously. He is, as Walter Isaacson puts it, the founder who winks at us. I think there's an interesting contrast there with George Washington. I talked a lot in that episode about how he used seriousness to his advantage. He was a serious person. Well, I think Benjamin Franklin shows some of the advantages of not taking yourself too seriously. But as a consequence, I think people don't fully appreciate the greatness of Benjamin Franklin. I think the best way to understand that is to take each of his accomplishments separately and consider them individually. So as a scientist, He was arguably the most important scientist of his generation, like genuinely a groundbreaking scientist who deserves to be Maybe not in the top tier, but just below figures like Isaac Newton, Einstein, Faraday. If he hadn't accomplished everything else, if he hadn't accomplished everything else that he did, he would be highly regarded as a practical scientist and inventor. As a writer, he was America's first great writer and by far the greatest popular writer of his day. And if he hadn't accomplished everything else he did, he would be regarded as one of the great American writers on the same level as Mark Twain or Thoreau or Hemingway. He was America's greatest diplomat. If he hadn't accomplished everything else, he would be rightly regarded as like the American Metternich. And of course he was a founding father. And as I've argued previously, was one of the three, I think indispensable was one of the three, I think indispensable men of the American revolution, along with George Washington and Alexander Hamilton. And so in this weird way, Benjamin Franklin's accomplishments. Cancel each other out, I think. And so in a weird way, I think sometimes Benjamin Franklin's accomplishments like cancel each other out because people don't know what category to put them in because he accomplished so many different things. When you take it all together, he's one of the great geniuses of all time and especially of his time. He also happens to be the father of the self help industry.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/benjamin-franklin", "title": "Benjamin Franklin", "chunk_index": 0, "publication_date": "2024-06-30", "total_chunks_in_doc": 36}}
{"text": "category to put them in because he accomplished so many different things . When you take it all together , he ' s one of the great geniuses of all time and especially of his time . He also happens to be the father of the self help industry . Benjamin Franklin: He had this very systematic approach to self improvement that helped to create these extraordinary outcomes. And so there's a ton to learn from him because he left us this great legacy of not just what he did, but how he did it. He's the ultimate self made man. You know, when we use that phrase, self made man, we usually mean it as someone who didn't get their fortune from their parents, right? They didn't use any great financial support from others to gain their name or their fortune. But with Benjamin Franklin, he was a self made man. But with Benjamin Franklin, he was a self made man in the literal sense in that he made himself like every aspect of his character, like every aspect of his character was analyzed, molded, and improved to create just the type of man that he wanted to be. And that is, and so because of that, it's, it's really easy to analyze. And so, because of that, we have this great record to analyze of how he improved himself, how he accomplished so much. So there is a ton to learn. I hope you have, so there's a ton to learn. I hope you enjoy this episode. I hope you learn as much by. Studying the life of Benjamin Franklin as I did. My sources are the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, which is extraordinary I highly recommend it. It's great reading. And then also Benjamin Franklin and American life By Walter Isaacson, also a great book. So without further ado, this is the life of Benjamin Franklin. But first this episode is brought to you by Legacy. From Picasso to Cleopatra, the podcast Legacy looks at the lives of some of the most famous people to have ever lived and asks if they have the reputation they deserve. This season, they look at J. Edgar Hoover. He was the director of the FBI for half a century, an immensely powerful political figure. He was said to know everything about everyone. There will definitely be a J. Edgar Hoover episode of How to Take Over the World eventually. But in the meantime, this can tide you over. He held the ear of eight presidents and terrified them all. When asked why he didn't fire Hoover, JFK replied, You don't fire God. So from chasing gangsters to pursuing communists to relentlessly persecuting Dr. Martin Luther King and civil rights activists, Hoover's dirty tricks and tactics have been endlessly echoed in the years since", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/benjamin-franklin", "title": "Benjamin Franklin", "chunk_index": 1, "publication_date": "2024-06-30", "total_chunks_in_doc": 36}}

And note, that is quite early. He would be 70 years old when American independence was declared. He was the only elderly founding father. Okay. So this is a generation before George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams. He was born in Boston. Ben was the 15th of his father's 17 children. So obviously that was across two marriages. Josiah Franklin, Josiah Franklin was his father and his first wife died after giving birth to their seventh child. And then he remarried. Originally, young Benjamin Franklin was marked out to be a minister, a member of the clergy. Josiah considered this his tithe. Okay, so I've got ten sons, one of them should serve the church, should serve God. And it made sense because, and it made sense specifically for Benjamin, because he was clearly very clever and an excellent reader. Uh, he had a kind of a literary mind, so it seemed like great, this, this guy will be a great minister. Unfortunately, he was also a born skeptic. One story is told that as a young child, he found the prayers before dinner to be very tedious. And so at the beginning of the winter one year, he asked his father, Hey, can we just pray over the barrels of salted provisions once and call it good for the rest of the season? So that's kind of where his mind went, right? Naturally kind of inquiring and skeptical. Franklin had a very adventurous, exciting, carefree childhood. His autobiography is really great. Again, I can't recommend it enough, and it reads as very Mark Twain. So Franklin was an avid swimmer, he spent a lot of time in the Charles River, and he spent a lot of time making mischief with his friends where he was the ringleader. He grew up in a middle class household, his, he grew up in an upper middle class household, his father was a candle maker, and that was enough to provide plenty of money for a good upbringing, although it wasn't enough to send Benjamin to Harvard. So if he wanted to be a clergy, it was expected", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/benjamin-franklin", "title": "Benjamin Franklin", "chunk_index": 2, "publication_date": "2024-06-30", "total_chunks_in_doc": 36}}

So if he wanted to be a clergy , it was expected Benjamin Franklin: that he would go to Boston Latin School, For his primary education and then to the one college in Massachusetts, which was Harvard. But supposedly there wasn't enough money, and so Ben Franklin was taken outta school at age 10. He worked for his father for a couple of years. During that time, he self-educate, reading everything he can get outta his hand. During that time, he self-educate. He reads everything he can get his hands on, including Plutarch's Lives is one of his favorites. And he ends up instead apprenticing for his brother who was a printer. He takes an interest in every aspect of the printing business. And And he takes an interest in every aspect of the printing business, from the technical details and mechanics of printing presses to the business aspects, to the content, the writing. He wants to make his own contributions. And I think the way he learns to write is really fascinating and something that should be used more often for people who want to learn to write well. So I never did this exercise growing up, but I think it'd be a really great war. So I never did exercises like this growing up, but I think it'd be a really great way to learn to write well, here's what he did. So he would find a copy of the spectator, big newspaper, and then he would take a persuasive article that he thought was well written and copy out the bullet points of the main arguments. Okay. So he's copying out for himself, like a little summary of the main points of an article. And then he'd put it aside for a few days, come back, and then he would look at the bullet points , and then try and write the same article. So he's kind of recreating, he's like, okay, here's what I'm trying to argue, how would I write this? Okay, how would I most persuasively construct this article? And then he says, quote, then I compared my spectator with the original, discovered some of my faults, and corrected them. Okay, so I think that's really cool and you can do it with any style, right?

If you want to be , um , if you want to be a podcaster , you could Benjamin Franklin: go listen to a Malcolm Gladwell podcast, write down his main points, and then script out your own episode of the same ideas that Malcolm Gladwell is saying. So, uh, I think that's something that should be used in schools, frankly. I think it's a really effective way to learn to write. So he gets an opportunity to try his hand at writing. Um, in just a couple of years. So I said, he's apprenticing for his brother. Who's a printer. Well, at first he's not printing his own stuff. He's, he's printing for other people, but then when Benjamin Franklin is 15, his brother, James starts his own newspaper. And so just a year later, Franklin decides he wants to try and write something for this new newspaper. And he realizes that his brother, like he looks at him a certain way, right? You're my little brother. And so he probably was not going to take kindly to him trying to submit an essay. And so he writes an article under a pseudonym and leaves it on the front step of the print shop. And the next day to his delight, some of the employees pick it up, read it and say, wow, this is great. You know, this is excellent. And so they print it in the paper the next day. The pseudonym is silence do good Benjamin Franklin invents this entire persona, uh, of this woman, silence, do good. And he's a very natural humorist. He he's naturally funny. His writing is, is hysterical, frankly. And so he's able to throw out these perfect little details. So for example, Mrs. Do good says of herself, quote. I could easily So for example, Mrs. Duguid, she's this old widow, and she's describing herself, and she says, quote, I could easily be persuaded to marry again. I am courteous and affable, good humored, unless I'm first provoked, and handsome, and sometimes witty. And the use of the term sometimes witty is just a perfect detail. Like, you immediately know and understand what kind of old woman would describe herself as sometimes witty. It just creates this character who is earnest and endearing, but also ridiculous. So anyway, um, this first essay does well. He continues to write more silenced do good essays. Eventually James discovers this and is very unhappy about it.

Eventually James discovers this and is very unhappy about it . And James was pretty Benjamin Franklin: tough on his younger brother. He always wanted him under his thumb. Uh, he was very jealous. He didn't want to be outshined. And so this really rubbed Ben Franklin the wrong way. through lines of his life was that he hated arbitrary authority. He hated big government tyrannies. He also hated small, petty, personal tyrannies. And so, uh, he hates this situation. He can't stand working for his brother who wants to keep him under his authority. And, uh, so he decides to run away and he's apprenticed to his brother. And so the laws of the time mean. Um, it's like a form of bondage. He, he technically can't leave legally, but forget that he wants to get outta Dodge and so he sneaks out on a ship. Uh, reading now from his autobiography, he says, quote, my friend Collins, therefore undertook to manage my escape for me. He agreed with the captain of a New York sloop for my passage under the notion of my being a young acquaintance of his that had got a naughty girl with child whose friends would compel me to marry her, and therefore I could not appear or come away publicly. Okay, so they concoct this story that he had knocked up a girl and so he's got to get away. And so this New York captain thinks they're not breaking any laws. And so he sneaks away Benjamin Franklin. So he goes first to New York where he meets with a printer. The printer is really impressed with him and can tell he's a smart kid. And he says, I don't have a job for you, but go talk to my son in Philadelphia. He's just set up a press and he needs a junior printer. And so Franklin continues his journey to Philadelphia. I'll read from Franklin's autobiography about his arrival for the first time in Philadelphia. It's one of the great scenes in American history. So here's what he says. I have been the more particular in this description of my journey and shall be so of my first entry into that city that you may, in your mind, compare such unlikely beginnings with the figure I have since made there.

I was fatigued with Benjamin Franklin: traveling, rowing, and want of rest. I was very hungry, and my whole stock of cash consisted of a Dutch dollar and about a shilling in copper. The latter I gave the people of the boat for my passage, who at first refused it on account of my rowing, but I insisted on their taking it. A man being sometimes more generous when he has but a little money. A man being sometimes more generous when he has but little money than when he has plenty, perhaps through fear of being thought to have but little. So, he pays the people who helped get him there, and then with the little other money he has, he buys three rolls of bread, and walks down the streets of Philadelphia with these rolls, and, and walks down the streets of Philadelphia with these rolls, and he's looking around, and he sees that everyone, is walking in the same direction. So he just starts walking with the crowd. And then here's what happened next. And then here's what happened next. He says, I joined them and thereby was led into the great meeting house of the Quakers near the market. I sat down among them and after looking around a while and hearing nothing said being very drowsy, I joined them and thereby was led into the great meeting house of the Quakers near the market. I sat down among them and after looking around a while and hearing nothing said. Being very drowsy through labor and want of rest the preceding night I fell fast asleep and continue and continue so till the meeting broke up when one was kind enough to rouse me This was therefore the first house I was in or slept in in Philadelphia Okay. Okay. So again, like very Mark Twain, right? Just shows up in the city. Doesn't know what to do is this kind of charmed young boy who's feckless, but everything kind of works out for him that he just follows the crowd ends up in a Quaker church. The Quakers have these funny meetings that are, you know, they're led by the spirit. So there's no official minister. Anyone can get up to speak. Which means for long times, um, just no one will speak. And so he doesn't know what's going on. He's never seen a Quaker meeting. Just goes into this meeting house. No one's talking.

And that ' s the first rest he has in Benjamin Franklin: the city of Philadelphia. Uh, he was not a Quaker himself, obviously. Um, his family was partial to Presbyterianism. As mentioned, he settled on deism quite early. He was a skeptic. He actually came into it by reading an anti deist pamphlet. That responded point by point to deist arguments. But when he read this pamphlet, he found the deist arguments more convincing than the rebuttals. And so deism is the belief in a distant and impersonal God who created the universe and put it into motion, but who does not interfere in the affairs of men. Here's how Franklin described his religious beliefs. He said, I never was without some religious principles. I never doubted for instance, the existence of the deity that he made the world and governed it by his providence. That the most acceptable service of God was the doing good to man, that our souls, that our souls are immortal and that all crime will be punished and virtue rewarded either here or hereafter. Okay. And actually these kind of amorphous beliefs would be very advantageous to them. In Philadelphia, because he made friends with everyone and he supported everyone. You know, he would donate money later in life to churches of all kinds, um, including all sorts of Christian denominations, Quakers, Presbyterians, Baptists, and even to, um, the Jewish community there as well for a synagogue. And so, being Benjamin Franklin, of course, he quickly lands on his feet, he gets a job in the printing business, and he quickly makes friends. He says, I began now to have some acquaintance among the young people of the town that were lovers of reading, with whom I spent my evenings very pleasantly. And gaining money by my industry and frugality. I lived very agreeably. Okay. So he's, he's a very charming, very charismatic person. And so he immediately starts making friends. And one of the friendships, one of the acquaintances he makes is the governor of Pennsylvania, his name's William Keith and Keith meets Franklin and immediately says, Hey, like, I like you, you're a smart kid. And Philadelphia needs a high quality newspaper. Why don't you start one? And I'll support you. And Franklin says, whoa, you know, the governor of Pennsylvania needs me. I'll do it. I'll be your top guy, governor Keith. So the first thing that he needs to do.

You know , in talking with Keith , he says , you Benjamin Franklin: need to go to London and get some equipment, get a printing press and get a printing press and type and all that. So, uh, Governor Keith agrees to give Franklin a letter of credit to buy all this stuff in London. And when Franklin asks for the letter of credit, he says, don't worry, I'll get it to you later. And he keeps blowing him off until finally it's the day he's supposed to leave for London. And Benjamin Franklin goes to Governor Keith and says, Hey, Like, I really need that letter of credit. And he says, once again, oh yeah, no problem. Just go ahead, get on the ship, and I'll send the letter. Someone will catch up with it, and it'll be on board. Check the mail on board, and there you'll find your letter of credit. So Franklin hops on board a boat bound for London. And after a few days at sea, he tells the crew that he needs to see the mail. Explains the situation. And they laugh at him, they say, You can check the mail, but I guarantee you, there's no letter , And his friend tells him what's going on, quoting again from the autobiography, he says, He let me in to Keith's character, told me there was not the least probability that he had written any letters for me. That no one who knew him had the smallest dependence on him. And he laughed at the notion of the governor's giving me a letter of credit, having, as he said, no credit to give. On my expressing some concern about what I should do, he advised me to endeavor getting some employment in the way of my business. Among the printers here, said he, you will improve yourself. And when you return to America, you will set up to greater advantage. So in the middle of, of this, so, so in the middle of this journey to London, he's like, All right, new plan, I guess. Like, I guess I'll get a job when I show up in London. Uh, he doesn't have money for a return voyage, so that's the plan. Um, on the voyage to London, some other interesting things happened.

One is that he had become something of a vegetarian , um , in part for moral reasons , but in part to save money so that he could buy Benjamin Franklin: more books. And, um, yeah. And he comments on his kind of breaking down and no longer being vegetarian on this journey. Here's what he writes, he said, But I had formerly been a great lover of fish, and when this came hot out of the frying pan, it smelt admirably well. I balanced some time between principle and inclination, till I recollected that, when the fish were opened, I saw smaller fish taken out of their stomachs. Then thought I, if you eat one another, I don't see why I shouldn't eat you. So, uh, So I dined upon cod very heartily and continued to eat with other people, returning only now and then occasionally to a vegetable diet. And then Franklin is very self aware of the sort of self serving nature of this decision. He says, So convenient a thing it is to be a reasonable creature, since it enables one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to do. Okay, so Franklin would flirt with vegetarianism. For the rest of his life, but, um, was never very consistent with it. So great. Franklin arrives. He's now in London with no contacts. So great. Franklin arrives. He's now in London with no contacts, no money to complete his mission. He's just there to find a job. He does the same thing he did in Philadelphia. He quickly is able to find a job at a printing press and he quickly makes friends, especially in literary circles. As an employee, he's very industrious. He quickly rises, and one way he does that is that everyone in the printing business just guzzles beer. So they'll have a couple of pints of beer before lunch, and then a few more after. And they think that this is nutritious, and is the way to go, and and he only drinks water, which they think is odd. And so the fact that everyone else is going around mildly drunk all the time, And he's clear headed, allows him to A, like be more physically vigorous because he has wits about him and make better decisions and be smarter. And so it makes him a very valuable employee. He's also just a strong person. Uh, part of that is he was naturally robust. And then the other thing is he was very physically active.

You know , a lot of these people grew up in the slums of London , uh , in , in , in Benjamin Franklin: those very cramped, crowded conditions, poorly nourished, whereas he had grown up. With fresh air, he was swimming, running, was fed well. So he's robust, and that's a big part of what he's doing. Like, this is not just a email job like I have. Like, it is a physical job. He's carrying around the type. He has to press things and carry things and lift things. So his strength is another big asset to him in this employment. So he's in London for about a year and a half. before someone finally offers him a loan to go back to Philadelphia. So he goes back to the U. S., and it's sort of an 18 month misadventure in London, but it does serve him well because he has the opportunity to learn printing. From the heart of the industry, right? The world's best newspapers were in London. And so it's like doing an internship at Apple or Facebook. This is a world class printer. And now he knows what a world class operation should look like. So Franklin is coming home with some experience and a feather in his cap. He summarizes it. He summarizes this stint in London thusly in his biography, he says, Thus I spent about eighteen months in London. Most part of the time I worked hard at my business, and spent but little upon myself except in seeing plays and in books. üìç This episode is brought to you by Miracle Made.

Becomes a self improver, uh, in his autobiography, he writes, it was about this time I conceived the bold and arduous project of arriving at moral perfection. I wish to live without committing any fault at any time. I would conquer all that either natural inclination, custom, or company might lead me into. As I knew or thought I knew what was right or wrong, I did not see why I might not always do the one and avoid the other, okay, so like a, a very bold project, right? To avoid at moral perfection, to always make the right choice. Okay, so he writes out 13 virtues. He kind of goes through the various creeds, the various sects, the various religions. And he says, basically all of them arrive at these 13 virtues. So this is what I need to perfect in order to always make the right decision. So here they are. And he gives a brief definition of each of the 13 virtues. Number one, number one, temperance, number one, temperance. Number one, temperance. Eat not to dullness, drink not to elevation. Number two, silence. Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself. Avoid trifling conversation.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/benjamin-franklin", "title": "Benjamin Franklin", "chunk_index": 11, "publication_date": "2024-06-30", "total_chunks_in_doc": 36}}

Let each part of your business have its time. Number four, resolution. Resolve to perform what you ought. without fail what you resolve. Number five, frugality. Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself, i. e. waste nothing. Number six, industry. Lose no time. Be always employed in something useful. Cut off all unnecessary actions. Number seven, sincerity. Use no hurtful deceit. Think innocently, think innocently and justly, and if you speak, speak accordingly. Number eight, justice.

Number 12, chastity, rarely use venery, but for health or offspring, never to dullness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another's peace or reputation. And then number 13, humility. He says, simply imitate Jesus and Socrates. Okay. So 13 different virtues. How are you going to accomplish all of that at once? And he considered that, here's what he said, quote, My intention being to acquire the habitude of all these virtues, I judged it would be well not to distract my attention by attempting the whole at once, but to fix it on one of them at a time, and why I should be master of that, then to proceed to another, and so on, till I should have gone through the thirteen. And as the previous acquisition of some might facilitate the acquisition of certain others, I arranged them with that view, as they stated above. As they stand above. Okay, so he's going to tackle them one at a time, And kind of build as he goes. And he makes a notebook to help him with this. Here's how he makes the notebook. He says, quote, I made a little book in which I allotted a page for each of the virtues. I ruled each page with red ink so as to have seven columns, one for each day of the week, making each column with a letter for the day. I crossed these columns with 13 red lines, marking the beginning of each line with the first letter of one of the virtues, on which line, and", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/benjamin-franklin", "title": "Benjamin Franklin", "chunk_index": 12, "publication_date": "2024-06-30", "total_chunks_in_doc": 36}}
{"text": "columns , one for each day of the week , making each column with a letter for the day . I crossed these columns with 13 red lines , marking the beginning of each line with the first letter of one of the virtues , on which line , and Benjamin Franklin: in its proper column, I might mark, by a little black spot, every fault I found upon examination to have been committed respecting that virtue upon that day. I determined to give a week's strict attention to each of the virtues successively. Thus, in the first week, my great guard was to avoid every, my great guard was to avoid every offense against temperance, leaving the other virtues to their ordinary chance, only by, only marking every evening the faults of the day, only marking every evening the faults of the day. Thus, in the first week, I could keep my first line, marked T, clear of spots. I suppose the habit of that virtue so much strengthened and its opposite weakened, that I might venture extending my attention to include the next and the following week keep both lines clear of spots. Okay, so in other words, for one week, he's just focused on temperance. The next week, considering, you know, I've mastered temperance, been temperate for seven days, the next week he's primarily focused on silence, okay? The keeping temperance. Going the third week. Okay. I've mastered temperance and silence. Now I'm focused on order and so on and so forth until by the 13th week, he has mastered 13 virtues, okay. 13 weeks to moral perfection. Would you look at that? Okay, to give you the whole process, because, um, I imagine some of you, like myself, will be interested in trying to copy this. He also gave a prayer every morning. He had two variations of it that he used daily to help him focus on these virtues. So the first prayer is this, O powerful goodness, bountiful father, Merciful guide. Increase in me that wisdom which discovers my truest interest. Strengthen my resolutions to perform what that wisdom dictates. Accept my kind offices to thy other children as the only return in my power for thy continual favors to me. All right, and then the other one. Father of light and life, thou good supreme, O teach me what is good. Teach me thyself. Save me from folly, vanity, and vice, from every low pursuit. And fill my soul with knowledge, conscious peace, and virtue pure, sacred, substantial, never fading bliss. Okay, and then the last element of this moral perfection is this schedule that he creates. So, he wrote it out, and here it is.

From 5am to 8am , rise , wash , and Benjamin Franklin: address powerful goodness. Okay, he always has all these euphemisms for God, because he didn't really believe in, like, the Christian God, per se so you heard some of those in his prayer, right here. He's calling it powerful goodness. Okay. So rise, wash and address powerful goodness, contrive day's business and take the resolution of the day, prosecute the present study and breakfast. Okay. So kind of rise and shine, plan out the day, um, and, and do any studies necessary from 5 AM to 8 AM. Okay, from 8 a. m. to 12 p. m., work. From 12 p. m. to 2 p. m., read or overlook my accounts and dine. And then from 2 p. m. to 6 p. m., work again. Then from 6 p. m. to 10 p. m., put things in their places, supper, music or diversion or conversation, examination of the day. Okay, so that's kind of the last thing he does. Um, is And something, so that's the last thing he does is exam. And how did the day go mark his little virtues. And then from 10 PM to 5 AM, he has sleep. Now take all this with a giant grain of salt because even Benjamin Franklin admits that he actually didn't keep the schedule that much ended up being too constraining on him and also, you know, Uh, he says my scheme of order gave me the most trouble. And I found that though it might be practical where a man's business was such as to leave him the disposition of his own time, that of a journeyman printer, for instance, it was not possible to be exactly observed by a master who must mix with the world and often receive people of business at their own hours. All right. So, uh, like you've probably done this before you schedule out your whole day. And then someone's like, Hey, I need to meet at 2 PM. Ah, there goes my whole schedule. So. You know, I think it was probably a good exercise to try at, um, but he, he couldn't keep that consistent of a schedule. And he admits that. And also like the whole endeavor is a little bit foolhardy, which again, he admits, he says, but on the whole, though, I never arrived at the perfection.

And also like the whole endeavor is a little bit foolhardy , which again , he admits , he says , but on the whole , though , I never arrived at the perfection . I had been Benjamin Franklin: so ambitious of obtaining, but fell fall, but fell far short of it. Yet I was by the endeavor, a better and happier man than I otherwise should have been. If I had not attempted it. As those who aim at perfect writing by imitating the engraved copies, though they never reach the wished for excellence of those copies, their hand is mended by the endeavor, and is tolerable while it continues fair and legible. Okay, at the time that he is trying self improvement, he's also trying mutual improvement. So he gets together this group that he calls the junto. I actually, I was trying to look it up how they pronounced it. I think Franklin pronounced it the yunto or the junto. Anyway, I'll call it the junto, um, J U N T O. So he gets this together, this junto, which is a bunch of young guys like himself who are ambitious, who are curious, and who are going places. And, uh, he tells us exactly how he set it up. He says, the rules that I drew up required that every member in his turn should produce one or more queries on any point of morals, politics, or natural philosophy to be discussed by the company, and once in three months produce and read an essay of his own writing on any subject he pleased. Our debates were to be under the direction of a president and to be conducted in the sincere spirit of inquiry after truth. Without fondness for dispute or desire of victory and to prevent warmth all expressions of positiveness in opinions or direct Contradiction were after some time made contraband and prohibited under small pecuniary penalties Okay, so it's basically like hey, this isn't a debating club. It's not about sports Like who's getting, scoring the most points, you know, who's looking the best. It's about actual inquiry and improvement. And so, uh, we try not to agree with each other too much Or criticize like we're just trying to get at the truth. And this Junto lasts for upwards of 40 years. So it's really successful. And it actually inspires some imitation groups and some other clubs form. But I talked last episode about the power of peer groups. I think it is probably the most important lesson of this episode. There is something incredibly powerful about meeting as a group. With a deliberate focus on improvement or progress. He also has wider plans for this Junto. He wants to turn it into a religion.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/benjamin-franklin", "title": "Benjamin Franklin", "chunk_index": 15, "publication_date": "2024-06-30", "total_chunks_in_doc": 36}}
{"text": "think it is probably the most important lesson of this episode . There is something incredibly powerful about meeting as a group . With a deliberate focus on improvement or progress . He also has wider plans for this Junto . He wants to turn it into a religion . Benjamin Franklin: He calls it a sect. Uh, maybe a better comparison is a fraternal order. And I actually get asked all the time about founding a religion. And that's because if you're interested in a podcast called how to take over the world, you're interested in power and influence, right? And it's hard to ignore that some of the most influential people in history have been religious founders. So Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, you know, St. Paul, Martin Luther, all of these people had immense impact. And Benjamin Franklin never executed on his plan to turn his principles and the Junto into a religion. But he says he thinks it's a good plan and it could work. So if you want to try it. You know, this is something you're interested in. It's kind of a crazy idea, but here's the plan. It revolves around his 13 virtues. Uh, that's kind of the heart of his doctrine. And here's what he says about it. My ideas at the time were, that the sect should be begun and spread at first among young and single men only. That each person to be initiated should not only declare his assent to such creed, but should have exercised himself with a 13 weeks examination and practice of the virtues. As in the before mentioned model that the existence of such a society should be kept a secret till it was become considerable. To prevent solicitations for the admission of improper persons, but that the members should each of them search among his acquaintance for ingenious, well disposed youths, to whom, with prudent caution, the scheme should be gradually communicated, that the members should engage to afford their advice, assistance, and support to each other in promoting one another's interests, business, and advancement in life, that for distinction, we should be called the society of the free and easy. And then he goes on to say that he's of the opinion that it was a practicable scheme and might have been very useful, but that he didn't have the time to carry it out. Okay, so, I think it's interesting, again, most people listening are not going to try and start a religion, hopefully, , but I think there's some interesting principles there, especially around the idea of secrecy, and how actually, like, Keeping something exclusive can make it grow faster than something that you're shouting from the rooftops and actively trying to advertise. Uh,", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/benjamin-franklin", "title": "Benjamin Franklin", "chunk_index": 16, "publication_date": "2024-06-30", "total_chunks_in_doc": 36}}

Uh , Benjamin Franklin: so that's one thing that I took away from his, his religion building ideas. Okay. So this is kind of all how Benjamin Franklin is trying to improve himself and others in 17, in 1729, he starts his own newspaper and printing shop. His newspaper quickly becomes the best paper in Philadelphia. He's not the sole writer, but he's the best writer and the most prolific for the newspaper. Sometimes he writes under his own name, more often he writes under these various pen names that he contrives. So, uh, you know, previously he had silence do good, but he's got all these other, this big cast of whimsical, funny characters into whose mouths he can put incisive and often irreverent thoughts. Hey, the, the, and look like he was not very precious about his anonymity. Like he didn't try very hard to conceal his identity. It was more of a, it was more of like a literary technique than it was an actual effort to protect his identity. So that's 1729. He starts his newspaper and printing shop. 1730, he gets married. I think his recounting of his marriage gives a really good peek at what it was like. He says, I took her to wife September 1st, 1730. She proved a good and faithful helpmate, assisted me much by attending the shop. We drove together and have ever mutually endeavored to make each other happy. Okay. So like that is what it was like. It was a happy, sensible, practical marriage. Although as you might have gotten from that passage, He was not a particularly passionate marriage. Um, things are going well for him. Uh, when things really turned for him is in 1732, he publishes his first edition of Poor Richard's Almanac. So an almanac is a listing. So an almanac is a useful listing. So an almanac is a listing of useful information for farmers. It has, uh, you can turn through all the dates in a year and has information on sunrise, sunset, average temperatures, moon phases, precipitation, like all the information. And of course, Franklin invents a fake persona to be the supposed publisher of this almanac, a man named Richard Saunders. So the almanac does two things differently than other almanacs. The first is that it is very funny. He writes this foreword from Richard Saunders every year. And in this foreword, he carries on a fake feud with a man who writes into him. So Richard predicts the So in the", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/benjamin-franklin", "title": "Benjamin Franklin", "chunk_index": 17, "publication_date": "2024-06-30", "total_chunks_in_doc": 36}}

And in this foreword , he carries on a fake feud with a man who writes into him . So Richard predicts the So in the Benjamin Franklin: first edition, Richard predicts the death of Richard Saunders. of a man named Titan Leeds. This is not a real person, this is just another character in Benjamin Franklin's mind. And so the next year, Titan Leeds writes in with a nasty letter saying that Richard is a fraud. That he had falsely predicted his death and says, I'm still alive. And Franklin has Richard respond that Titan Leeds must indeed be dead. And that this man is a fraud who's writing in because he's so mean and his writing is so bad that quote, Titan leads when living would never have used me. So, okay. So like, it's, it's so great because it is genuinely hysterical comedy combined with this like useful everyday thing that people have to read anyway. And the comedy, when you read through this stuff, it genuinely holds up two and a half centuries later. Franklin, he's such a remarkable writer. He also puts into the almanac, he also puts into the almanac a number of funny and inspirational quotes, pithy wisdom. A lot of it is well known now to the point of clich√©. And much of it was clich√© at the time. So a lot of these old saying, So a lot of these quotes were not original to Benjamin Franklin. They were old sayings that had been around for years. But what Franklin was very good at was reworking them to make them even more memorable. So the most famous is probably, uh, one you've heard. It's early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise. You've also got, um, three may keep a secret if two of them are dead. Another lost time is never found again. Love your enemies for they tell you your faults and fish and visitors. And then an, and also fish and visitors stink in three days. Okay. So it's just some of those are legitimately supposed to be helpful pieces of advice. Some are just kind of funny observations, but he scatters these throughout the Almanac and they're very popular. So before the publication of this, you know, his publishing business had been doing well. It was increasingly profitable. Um, he had a lot of contracts publishing for others. His newspaper was doing well, but poor Richard's almanac makes him rich. He sells over 10, 000 copies per year. It's a huge phenomenon. It's the first great literary success in", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/benjamin-franklin", "title": "Benjamin Franklin", "chunk_index": 18, "publication_date": "2024-06-30", "total_chunks_in_doc": 36}}

It ' s the first great literary success in Benjamin Franklin: American history. And so, and so it makes Benjamin Franklin rich, like genuinely rich, like not one of the richest people in America rich, but like, I don't ever have to work again if I don't want to rich. Around this same time, as he's becoming wealthy, he gets more involved in civic affairs. Um, so he creates the first subscription library in the United States. One interesting thing about that is he goes around and he says, Hey, I want to start a subscription library, you know, so that we all have this access to all these great books, it's going to be great, more people are gonna get more access to higher levels of literature, it's going to raise the general level of education in the city. It's going to be great for all of us. And people aren't really donating. So he changes his approach and here's what he says about that. He says the objections and reluctances I met with in soliciting the subscriptions made me soon feel the impropriety of presenting oneself as the prosperer, feel the impropriety of presenting oneself as the proposer of any useful project that might be supposed to raise one's reputation in the smallest degree above that of one's neighbors. When one has need of their assistance to accomplish that project, I therefore put myself as much as I could out of sight and stated it is a. and stated it as a scheme of a number of friends who had requested me to go out and propose it to such as they thought lovers of reading. In this way, my affair went on more smoothly, and I ever after practiced it on such occasions, and for my frequent successes can heartily recommend it. The present little sacrifice of your vanity will afterwards be amply repaid. Okay. So I just think that's such a smart approach, right? He's going around people saying, Hey, I want to start a subscription library. And people are kind of like, Ooh, I just rubs people the wrong way of like, Oh, that's a good idea. But man, it's gonna make Ben Franklin look so good. And they get a little jealous. Whereas when he starts going around saying, Hey, so a few of us were thinking, and then he pitches it, people are like, Oh, great. I want to buy in. It creates a sense of momentum. Right. That more people are bought into it than just one.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/benjamin-franklin", "title": "Benjamin Franklin", "chunk_index": 19, "publication_date": "2024-06-30", "total_chunks_in_doc": 36}}

That more people are bought into it than just one . Benjamin Franklin: And it creates a sense that, Oh, this is raising all of us rather than just raising you whose idea it is. And he uses this a number of times. Okay. So in the creation of the first subscription library in the U S but he also founds the university of Philadelphia. But he also founds the University of Pennsylvania, okay, Ivy League school, one of the great universities in the United States. He founds the first hospital in Philadelphia, the first, um, uh, fire brigade, right, System for preventing and putting out fires in Philadelphia. So he uses his approach to start all of these civic projects, which do extremely well and, and outlive him by, by hundreds of years in many circumstances. Now, so he's embarking on more civic pursuits. He also makes kind of another turn in his life at this point. He realizes, all right, I don't have to work, so I don't want to. So he basically turns over his business to someone else. Um, so he basically turns over his business to someone else and decides to dedicate his life to science. You know, he had always been curious, he'd always made useful little observations, he'd been the first American to cast typesets, so he was always a tinkerer, but now he wants to dedicate a significant part of his life to scientific inquiry and inventing. üìç üìç üìç Okay, but first, this episode is brought to you by ExpressVPN.

Both were obsessed with following their curiosity. And, and there are a lot of other similarities to, I mean, they were both great artists, you know, Da Vinci as a painter and Franklin as a writer. Both had eccentric religious views, both loved swimming and the water. Both were great doodlers who like to sketch out geometric, who like to sketch out geometric patterns. Both of them made a number of eclectic scientific discoveries based on curiosity rather than careful academic analysis. Both of them flirted with vegetarianism in their life. Like it's weird. They were kind of the same type of person. And so Franklin made discoveries in much the same way that da Vinci did, which was not this very sort of academic, careful analysis, but rather just through these interesting observations, following his curiosity, just notices all this stuff. And then he looks into it and makes these cool discoveries. So he makes breakthroughs in the spread of disease, in ocean currents, in the direction of Northeastern storms, lead poisoning. He developed the first catheter. Uh, he does some discoveries in heat and refrigeration, like just a bunch of random stuff, but his two most important contributions were first the Franklin stove, which was a more efficient way to heat homes. And then by far his most important discoveries were around lightning and electricity. And so his inquiries into electricity start because he sees some electrical demonstrations. And these are basically like carnival sideshows, right? The men doing them are scientifically minded. Yes. But the approach is not. So the men doing them are scientifically minded. Yes, but the approach is not like, what can we learn from this? It's more of like, isn't this cool? Look what I can do with these sparks and these electrical currents and look at this. Okay. And that is what gets Franklin interested. And he always believed that following your curiosity was the best approach for scientific discovery. Someone asked him once about, it was a different field, I think it was hot air balloons. And, uh, they say, what's the use of any of this? And here's how Franklin responded. He said, What is the use of a newborn baby? It does not seem to me a good reason to decline prosecuting a new experiment, which apparently increases the power of man over matter, until we can see", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/benjamin-franklin", "title": "Benjamin Franklin", "chunk_index": 21, "publication_date": "2024-06-30", "total_chunks_in_doc": 36}}
{"text": "And here ' s how Franklin responded . He said , What is the use of a newborn baby ? It does not seem to me a good reason to decline prosecuting a new experiment , which apparently increases the power of man over matter , until we can see Benjamin Franklin: to what use that power may be applied. When we have learned to manage it, we may hope sometime or other to find uses for it, as men have done for magnetism and electricity, of which the first experiments were mere matters of amusement. Okay, so I think that's really interesting, right? Like, who cares what use it's going to be? I'm following my curiosity, it's amusing, I like it, and guess what, it's all gonna end up important in the end. I'm sure that we will find practical uses for it eventually. So he's experimenting with electricity, and he notices some similarities between electricity and lightning. And he suggested that they might be one in the same, that lightning might be made out of electricity. Now, he was not the first person to notice these similarities, but he was the first person to confirm it through experimentation. So he does a number of experiments, the most famous of which is he flies a kite with a key to attract lightning strikes. It kind of shows, okay, like lightning is attracted to metal, then maybe it's like electricity. So he also develops the lightning rod. Which is what it sounds like, right? It's a metal rod that attracts lightning and discharges it into the ground So that a house will not be struck and catch on fire And I think the lightning rod is today probably one of the most underrated inventions of all time So to us living in 2024, lightning is so mundane It's so non threatening that it's difficult to put yourself He had the mindset of someone for whom every lightning storm was a very serious threat. Many people would die every year from lightning strikes, and much more dangerous than the lightning itself were the fires that they would cause. The Walter Isaacson biography has a statistic that in the mid 1700s in Germany alone, More than 10 churches per year were burned down from lightning strikes. And it was often churches that were struck because they were the tallest building in the town and they had a giant metal bell, right? A church bell at the top. And so a number of these fires would spread and burn down entire towns and cities. And like, this was a permanent feature of life. Lightning strike. Lightning storm comes, you huddle up indoors and hope for the best, but like, it might hit your house and set the whole thing on fire and kill you and your family.

And even if it doesn ' t Benjamin Franklin: hit your house, it might catch the entire town on fire and burn down your entire town. People lived in constant fear of this. Happened all the time. So when Benjamin Franklin invents the lightning rod, it saves thousands of lives per year, and makes Franklin a huge celebrity all over the United States and the entire world. And nowhere was this more true than in France. So the French, I talked about this on the Wright Brothers episode, they're very good at taking the innovations of others and championing them, celebrating them, and then cultivating and improving on them. And that is what happens here. French scientists reproduce Franklin's results, often going even further and making more discoveries about lightning and electricity. And the French people, including the French king, are ecstatic. And really love and celebrate Benjamin Franklin. One of the Franklin's friends from London reported to him that the king had issued an order, quote, One of Franklin's friends from London reported to him that the king had issued an order, saying, quote, The Grand Monarch of France strictly commands that his scientists convey compliments in an express manner to Mr. Franklin of Philadelphia for the useful discoveries in electricity and application of the pointed rods to prevent the terrible effects of thunderstorms. Okay, back in the United States, Harvard and Yale give him honorary degrees in 1753. The London Royal Society makes him the first person outside of Britain to receive the prestigious Gold Copley Medal. Okay, and the thing most Okay, and the thing people are most excited about is the Okay, and the thing that people are most excited about is, of course, the lightning rod. And he was primarily a practical scientist. He was more focused on inventions and experimentation than theory. And yet, his studies did advance the theory of electricity significantly. As one scientist put it, he found electricity a curiosity and left it a science. From the Walter Isaacson biography, quote, he also came up with the distinction between insulators and conductors, the idea of electrical grounding, and the concepts of capacitors and batteries. And in fact, a lot of the terminology that we use around electricity, things like positive and negative charges. were invented by Benjamin Franklin. So again, like I said, was he a Newton or a Galileo or a Copernicus? No, but I would say that he still One of the great scientists of history. All right. So let's transition a little bit and talk about his political life. I'm treating them separately, but", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/benjamin-franklin", "title": "Benjamin Franklin", "chunk_index": 23, "publication_date": "2024-06-30", "total_chunks_in_doc": 36}}

I ' m treating them separately , but Benjamin Franklin: it's not like he was a scientist and then became a politician. A lot of this stuff was happening simultaneously, but it just made sense to talk about them separately. So with the success of his paper and the success of poor Richard's almanac, and then the success of his scientific discoveries, he rises up the ranks of political life until he eventually becomes Pennsylvania's leading man, and then in the American colonies, basically the preeminent man in, in all of the American colonies. He gets elected to Pennsylvania's legislature where he becomes an extremely influential voice. , and he is a voice in favor of democracy of the people, but he's moderate. Okay. He has some more right wing tendencies, such as he's opposed to welfare because he thinks it encourages dependency, but overall he favors middle class interests and democratic government. So in this kind of, uh, democratic stance, he opposes a group called the proprietors. Uh, these are the people who support the pens. So it's called Pennsylvania and that is named after a specific family and they owned most of Pennsylvania as their personal property. They're mostly absentee landlords who lived in England, who would often live and rule who lived in England. And they had been granted Pennsylvania as a Royal charter. Uh, a few generations back. And the Penns and Franklin disagreed about a lot, but the big thing is that even though the Penns were the wealthiest family in Pennsylvania, and they owned all this land, they were never taxed. They paid zero taxes. Every bill passing a new tax would exempt the Penn estates, which understandably drove people like Franklin crazy. So all the people on his side, and that's the majority in the Pennsylvania legislature, they're upset about this. They're upset about this. And so eventually Benjamin Franklin is sent to London as an agent on behalf of the legislature of Pennsylvania to lobby, to represent some of their grievances to the government in London. And so he ends up living in London for five years from 1757 to 1762. So this is when he is 49 until he's about 54. He only comes home briefly in 1762 until he goes back to England as an agent once again in 1765. He's once again a representative of Pennsylvania, but while there, um, that's when things are starting to kind of heat up with independence back in the colonies. And so more and more states vote him power to be their representative as well until", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/benjamin-franklin", "title": "Benjamin Franklin", "chunk_index": 24, "publication_date": "2024-06-30", "total_chunks_in_doc": 36}}

And so more and more states vote him power to be their representative as well until Benjamin Franklin: he's basically representing the United States. All the colonies as representative. And so as this breakdown is happening, Franklin is the one who represents to the British government, why their policies are so grievous to the Americans. One mistake he does make though, is he's kind of a moderate, right? So when the stamp act is passed, Benjamin Franklin takes a look at it. And he's like, actually. That's not unreasonable. Um, like your taxes are too high, but stamp act, it's all right. And he misreads the situation. He doesn't know that back home in the colonies in Pennsylvania and elsewhere, people are furious about the stamp act. And so he puts forward one of his friends to be the tax collector. Of the Stamp Act, and this gets people really upset. So people back in the colonies are like, uh, well hang on a second. You know, we, uh, appointed you to be our representative to, to the United Kingdom, to Great Britain. And you're saying the stamp Act is okay, and people view him as a traitor. They get really mad, and in fact, there's a big riot. in Philadelphia, and it becomes pretty dangerous for Franklin's family. Listen to this account from Isaacson. He says, quote, Deborah, that's Franklin's wife, dispatched their daughter to New Jersey for safety. But ever the homebound stalwart, she refused to flee. Her cousin, Josiah Davenport, arrived with more than 20 friends to help defend her. Her account of that night, while harrowing is also a testament to her strength, she described it in a letter to her husband toward night. I said he cousin Davenport should fetch a gun or two as we had none. I sent to ask my brother to come and bring his gun. Also, we made one room, the magazine. I ordered some sort of defense upstairs as I could manage myself. I said, I was very sure you had done nothing to hurt anybody nor had not given any offense to any person at all. Nor would I be made uneasy by anybody, nor would I stir. Franklin's house and his wife were saved when a group of supporters, dubbed the White Oak Boys, gathered a force to confront them up. If Franklin's house was destroyed, they declared, so too would the beat.

If Franklin ' s house was destroyed , they declared , so too would be the homes Benjamin Franklin: of anyone involved. Finally, the mob dispersed. I honor much the spirit and courage you showed, he wrote Deborah after hearing of her ordeal. The woman deserves a good house that is determined to defend it. Okay, so that gives you an idea of how hard people have turned on Benjamin Franklin. There are literally mobs outside his house in Philadelphia threatening to burn the place down, even with his wife inside of it. And they're only dispersed by, like, a counter mob that's on his side. So this goes on actually for a while, that he's very unpopular. Uh, it kind of turns around. When he is called to testify in front of parliament about the stamp act. And he, and he gives a very popular speech and he defends colonial interests. He explains why they don't like the stamp act, why it's unfair and why it's unpopular. During the questioning, he answered it during the questioning. He answers very prophetically, um, in a certain time, here's what it says. Uh, the questioner says, would America submit to a compromise? 'No, said Franklin. 'It was a matter of principle. 'So only military force could compel them to pay the Stamp Act? 'It was a matter of principle. 'So only military force could compel them to pay the Stamp Tax? 'I do not see how a military force could be applied to that purpose, Franklin answered. Questioned. 'Why may it not? Franklin. 'Suppose a military force is sent into America. 'They will find nobody in arms. 'What are they then to do? They cannot force a man to take stamps who chooses to do without them. They will not find a rebellion. They may indeed make one. So this testimony, um, So this testimony changes the mind of Parliament. I think in the American perspective we only hear about, uh, the British as the, Tyrants who are holding us down. Um, actually, as you read these stories, like frankly, British parliament was pretty reasonable through much of the process. Anyway, um, the stamp acts are repealed. And so Franklin becomes an even bigger celebrity back home. All of that drama, all that hatred towards him gets turned around.

We acknowledge your authority over import duties and things like that. It's just internal taxation that we have this problem with. And so Townsend decides to put, push him on it. And so they pass some acts called the Townsend acts that impose these really heavy external duties. Like, Oh, okay. We can impose external taxes. Here we go. And of course they're, they're very heavy external taxes. And so people get upset once again and things devolve. And in 1775, it's becoming clear that war is probably going to happen. And so Franklin can't do much more as a, as a representative there, and he returns home. When he comes home, he's promptly elected a Pennsylvania delegate to the Continental Congress, where he was elected the Postmaster General of the Colonies and helped to edit the Declaration of Independence. His greatest contribution to the Declaration of Independence, which is totally Jefferson's document, Franklin is just one of a few people edits, but his greatest edit was Jefferson had written, we hold these truths to be sacred and undeniable. And Franklin changes it to, we hold these truths to be self evident. He made another, he made a number of other very small edits as well. Uh, mostly kind of grammatical edits, but he is the elder statesman of the continental Congress. It was primarily a body made up of young men, but he, uh, it's primarily a body of young men, right? Young, ambitious men.

Uh, people line the streets of Paris just to catch a glimpse of him when he arrives. Everything he does becomes a fad. Uh, he's very smart about the image he projects.

I mean, you have to consider what he ends up pulling off, all right? So, most of you know the story of the Revolutionary War, especially if you've listened to my Washington and Hamilton episodes. But he secures a military alliance with France, who gain basically nothing from the war. Other than embarrassing England. And, he secures so much money in loans from France that it ends up bankrupting them, and their lack of funds is one of the reasons for the French Revolution. So he gets tons of money and military support with basically no reciprocal obligations. And then, at the end of the war, he ends up back channeling with England and secures a very favorable peace that, once again, does not a lot for France. So he gets everything as a diplomat. So how does he do it? What is the secret to his genius as a diplomat? Well, once again, you can't overlook his celebrity. Which he does an excellent job of cultivating through his dress and his conversation, everything. One of the other very clever things that he does is he has a spy in his staff.

If you have an obstacle or disadvantage, maybe try asking yourself, what would it look like if this were an advantage instead, can you use those disadvantages? As advantages rather than obstacles. Okay. Well, with French support, the war ends, the Americans are victorious. Franklin is able to secure, uh, this very, Franklin is able to secure this very advantageous piece with both England and France, he actually lingers in France for quite a while. He has built up this salon in this social circle in France that he quite enjoys, but eventually his health was getting so bad he's now in his seventies and he suffered from gout. He's now in his seventies and he suffered from gout that he decides it's time to come back home. So he goes back home to Philadelphia where he is elected president of Pennsylvania, which was their equivalent of governor.

He brings men Benjamin Franklin: into his garden at his house, which is not far from where they were meeting, and talks with them in the shade of his trees. He calms people down and encourages them to compromise. The biggest controversy of the convention was over whether the new entity would be truly a united nation or a collection of mostly independent states. And Franklin strongly favored a strong central government, a United States, like Washington and Hamilton. And in fact, he wanted a unicameral legislature that only represented the country based on population. Okay. So that was a very strong version. of a federal government. Well, the eventual compromise that emerged was, well, the eventual compromise that emerged was the one that the U. S. has today, with an upper chamber, the Senate, that represents the states equally, and a lower chamber, the House of Representatives, that represents the nation based on population. Now, this wasn't Franklin's idea. The idea for this compromise originated with some representatives from Connecticut, but it was Franklin who pulled everyone together, Convinced them that this was worth compromising on, even though it left everyone a little unsatisfied. And it was ultimately Franklin who made the proposal for the state based Senate and the population based house. At one point when things were becoming very contentious over this issue, Franklin made a very unexpected move. Here's what Isaacson writes. He says, once again, it was time for Franklin to try to restore equanimity and this time he did. So in an unexpected way, in a speech on June 28th, he suggested that they open each session with a prayer. With the convention groping as it were in the dark to find political truth. He said, how has it happened that we have not hither two once thought to humbly with the convention groping as it were in the dark to find political truth? He said, how has it happened that we have not hither two once thought of humbly applying to the father of lights to illuminate our understandings? Then he added in a passage destined to become famous. The longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid?

At the end of the process, the constitution was a total compromise and it did not reflect the exact desired government of anyone. And so a lot of people who were at the constitutional convention were skeptical. They're like, you know, they're like, you know, do I really like this thing? Do I really want to support it? And Franklin gives this last speech that pushes many people over the edge. To vote for it anyway. It's very folksy and wise. He starts out by acknowledging the constitution is far from what he would consider perfect, but then he says, maybe I don't know what perfect is. Here's what he says. I confess that I do not entirely approve this constitution at present, but sir, I am not sure. I shall never approve it for having lived long. I have experienced many instances of being obliged by better information or fuller consideration to change opinions even on important subjects, which I once thought right, but found to be otherwise. It is, therefore, that the older I grow, the more apt I am to doubt my own judgment and pay more respect to the judgment of others.

At that moment, Michelangelo came by and Leonardo suggested that he might be able to explain it.Michelangelo took offense as if Leonardo were mocking him. No, explain it yourself. He shot back. You were the one who modeled a horse to be cast in bronze, was unable to do it, and was forced to give up the attempt in shame. He then turned and walked away. On another occasion. When Michelangelo encountered Leonardo, he again referred to the fiasco of this force horse monument saying, so those idiot Meese actually believed in youNo wonder he was jealous.

Look carefully and separately at each detail. He compared it to looking at the page of a book, which is meaningless when taken in as a whole, and instead needs to be looked at word by word. Deep observation must be done in steps.This is a quote from Da Vinci. ‚ÄúIf you wish to have a sound and knowledge of the form of objects, begin with the details of them and did not go on to the second step until you have the first well fixed in memory‚ÄùExample: How do birds fly? First, define the motion of the wind, and then describe how the birds steer through it with only the simple balancing of the wings entail. do this after the description of their anatomy.So essentially he's sequencing it. One, describe the anatomy of a bird. Two, describe the motion of wind, and then three, how the two interact.And I think that‚Äôs a powerful tool.

Leonardo Da Vinci Part 2 Script One day Leonardo was walking through one of the central Piazza's of Florence talking with some friends. He was extroverted, personable, and popular and so he always seemed to have a retinue of followers, associates, and friends following him around to discuss intellectual issues. And at this particular time, they were discussing a passage from the great Italian poet and writer, Dante. Some of his friends had just asked Leonardo his opinion on the meaning of a particular passage from Dante. And at the exact moment that they asked him this question, Leonardo noticed a fellow artist walking by. So Leonardo decided to bring this fellow artist into the conversation. He turned and called out and asked him what he thought of the passage. But it went horribly wrong. The artist took offense. He thought Leonardo was mocking him. No, he shot back. Explain it yourself and say, aren't you the idiot who started that big statue in Milan but wasn‚Äôt able to finish and had to give up the attempt in shame. And then this young artist stormed off. It must've been a very awkward moment. I imagine Leonardo's friends looking at their shoes or staring off awkwardly, not knowing how to respond. And Leonardo shrugging and saying ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs Michelangelo for you.‚Äù Michelangelo and Leonardo are a good comparison in opposites. Leonardo was the ultimate polymath. He liked to flit from topic to topic from subject to subject, from field to field. One day he was a painter. The next he was an architect. The next, he was a scientist.

{"text": "liked to flit from topic to topic from subject to subject , from field to field . One day he was a painter . The next he was an architect . The next , he was a scientist . Michelangelo was intensely focused on whatever he was doing and had Leonardo Da Vinci (Part 2): no room in his mind for anything else. He was not interested in science or technology or invention. He just wanted to be the greatest artist in the world. And whereas Leonardo was popular, collaborative, and handsome, Michelangelo was reclusive, secretive, abrasive, and ugly. He was hunchbacked and disheveled, and usually smelled bad. This was because he didn‚Äôt have time to bathe, when he woke up he wanted to just focus on the state or painting he was working on and obsess over it until he passed out. And it's amazing that using such different approaches, the two of them were able to become two of the greatest artists of their time, and perhaps of all time. And from stories like this, you get the impression that Michelangelo was jealous of Leonardo. I mean after all he was sacrificing so much in order to be a great artist, he was sacrificing, food and sleep and friends. Whereas Leonardo seemed to sacrifice very little. He just followed his curiosity. He lived a great and happy life, surrounded by friends. Michelangelo was a slave to his art. He was married to it. Whereas in his eyes, Leonardo, must have seemed like a dilettante. And yet this dilettante was every bit as good as him, how could he possibly be pulling it off? And I think the answer comes back to this idea of combining art and science, art and technology. Leonardo‚Äôs studies in these disparate fields came together to give him understandings and abilities that others simply didn‚Äôt have. And if this frustrated Michelangelo, it must have also frustrated his peers in academia. How was it that this painter was a better scientist than them? Last episode we talked a lot about how technology and science can make you a better artist, but today we‚Äôll talk about the inverse, how being an artist can make you a better scientist, technologist, entrepreneur, or really assist you in any field. So let's get into it. Let's hear about the rest of the life of Leonardo da Vinci. Welcome to how to take over the world. *** BREAK *** So when we left off last time, Leonardo had just left Milan. The French had just invaded which meant that his patron, the former duke of Milan, Ludovico Sforza, was forced to flee. So without a patron, Leonardo leaves Milan.

{"text": "Milan , Ludovico Sforza , was forced to flee . So without a patron , Leonardo leaves Milan . So he stops in Venice , where he advises the city , designs some under water scuba suits for them that were never used , goes around some other northern Italian Leonardo Da Vinci (Part 2): cities, before ending up back in Florence. On this journey he catalogs everything that he takes with him. And so we can see everything that he owned and we can see that he really did wear this flamboyant clothing that we read about. He had in his luggage, pink stockings, a rose tunic, a purple hat. So DaVinci really is going around dressing like Elton John. And we see that he had a slightly distinctive way of dressing, just like a number of other greats. Steve Jobs had his mock neck, Caesar had his long togas with the fringe, Joan of Arc had her suit of armor, Napoleon had his hat, and Da Vinci had his colorful clothing. Just like the other greats he felt the need to wear something slightly distinctive to mark himself out. When he gets to Florence, this is one of the more productive periods in his life. So he produces a number of famous artworks. His most famous artwork at the time was not the Mona Lisa or the Last Supper, it‚Äôs a painting called the Virgin and child with Saint Anne. It‚Äôs Anne, who is the mother of Mary, and Mary, and baby Jesus. And Mary is sitting on the lap of her mother, and she‚Äôs twisting to hold the baby Jesus who is holding a lamb. It was unrivaled in its realism and in particular its depiction of motion. A lot of paintings from the early renaissance the characters look quite stiff and if there is motion or movement it‚Äôs very obvious and unnatural. Well the twisting and reaching of Mary and Jesus is extremely realistic and natural. And of course you get everything else you get with Da VInci, extremely subtle and realistic shading, unparalleled use of light and shadow, very interesting and well drawn faces and bodies. And the result is not only beautiful, but it‚Äôs revolutionary. And this is actually the painting that makes Da Vinci the most famous artist in the world. So Vasari, his biographer from the 15 hundreds, writes ‚ÄúMen and women, young and old, continued for two days to flock for a sight of it to the room where it was as if to a grand festival to gaze at the marvels of Leonardo.‚Äù So this is like a blockbuster movie of its time.

{"text": "door just to catch a look . This is also the time when he starts the Mona Lisa . He doesn ‚Äô t finish it in Florence . He actually never finishes it . He would tinker and add and enhance the Mona Lisa right up to the end of Leonardo Da Vinci (Part 2): his life. It was never on display during his lifetime. But he starts it here in Florence. The subject of the painting was named Lisa Del Gioconodo She was the wife of a pretty prominent cloth merchant of Florence. And there's a little mystery surrounding why exactly it was that. DaVinci. Um, agreed to. Draw this portrait of this particular woman, Lisa. Because at the same time, there was this woman in another city, in Padua, who had begged Leonardo for a portrait and he was actively declining to do it. This woman was one of the more wealthy women in all of Italy, and she was a great patron of the arts, and she actually followed Da Vinci all the way to Florence and was talking to his friends and trying to get any angle in to get him to paint her portrait and he steadfastly refused. So the question is, why would he refuse this much more prominent and wealthy woman, and yet paint the portrait of Lisa Del Giacondo. There are a few reasons why he might have done it. One is that her family was friendly with Leonardo‚Äôs father, and they did business together. So it might have been a a personal favor. Additionally, Leonardo might have known her personally. There is also one cryptic line in one letter so suggest that one of the Medicis might have intervened and personally requested that he take the commission. And if you‚Äôre living in Florence, you can‚Äôt really turn down the Medicis. But I think the real reason he did it was that he was taken with her. Not romantically, but there was something about her face that he found captivating. He never delivered the portrait, so clearly it was more about the art than it was about the commission to him. And he worked on it his entire life, so clearly he had some attachment to it. Now one thing I do want to point out about the Mona Lisa is that what we have is only a shadow, only a pale remnant of what was originally done. And it‚Äôs still a masterpiece, but Leonardo loved to use these thin layers of oil paints to create a three dimensional effect, and many of those layers have faded over time, leaving us without the original effect. So for example, the biographer Vasari talks about how incredible and realistic the Mona Lisa‚Äôs eyebrows are. They are extremely detailed and realistic and beautiful. Well go look at the Mona Lisa, she doesn‚Äôt have any eyebrows. So this feature that he spent hour and hours painstakingly detailing each hair layer", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/leonardo-da-vinci-part-2", "title": "Leonardo Da Vinci (Part 2)", "chunk_index": 9, "publication_date": "2023-05-23", "total_chunks_in_doc": 23}}

So this feature that he spent hour and hours painstakingly detailing each hair layer Leonardo Da Vinci (Part 2): by layer and making the most realistic eyebrows ever done, and it‚Äôs lost to history. So returning to our narrative, he completes the virgin and child with Saint Anne, he starts the Mona Lisa, he also starts a mural called the Battle of Anghiari It was a mural on a wall of what was at the time known as the Palazzo Della Signoria which is now known as the Palazzo Vecchio. At the time, it was essentially Florence‚Äôs town hall, the seat of their government. It was one of the most important buildings in Florence, and added greatly to their prestige, and so they wanted a big beautiful mural for it. And so they hire Leonardo to paint one of the few big battles that Florence had ever won. They weren‚Äôt much of a military state, they were more known for their finances. So they wanted to put up a big, cool looking mural. Uh, in it. So they hire DaVinci to do it. So he starts to paint it. He does extensive studies of war and conflict, and of horses too to make sure that everything is very accurate. And at the time he's getting started. The Florentines actually then go and for the opposite wall in this great hall they go and hire Michelangelo to paint the opposite wall with another battle. So yes, you heard that right. Leonardo is going to be painting one wall with a battle scene, and Michelangelo is going to be painting a battle scene on the wall on the other side of the room. Ladies and gentlemen, we‚Äôve got ourselves a good old fashioned showdown. Cowboy music The pressure must have been incredibly intense for both artists. The rivalry was heated and very public.Everyonewass referring to it as a competition. And I don‚Äôt think it was accidental. The masters of Florence who funded the affair were hoping that this competition would spur both men on to glorious new heights. But unfortunately, it didn‚Äôt. Neither of them finished their painting. In Leonardo‚Äôs case this was because he often didn‚Äôt finish commissioned works because he would get bored and lose interest. And because his painting style did not lend itself to large murals. His layers and layers of thin oil paints that tended to fade over the years started to fade in a matter of days when they were done on walls rather than on canvas. And for Michelangelo he didn‚Äôt finish, I think, because Leonardo‚Äôs mural was clearly so much better.

{"text": "of days when they were done on walls rather than on canvas . And for Michelangelo he didn ‚Äô t finish , I think , because Leonardo ‚Äô s mural was clearly so much better . Michelangelo was the world ‚Äô s greatest sculptor , but he was not the Leonardo Da Vinci (Part 2): greatest painter. And his painting would improve over the years before he did the Sistine chapel, but at this time he‚Äôs only 28 and not as great of a painter as he would eventually become. Da Vinci publicly ridiculed his painting, which featured a number of nude men. He said the men‚Äôs bodies looked like sacks of walnuts. And he was right, compared to Da Vinci‚Äôs bodies they were overly muscled, unnatural, and inelegant. Now I said that neither of them finished, and that‚Äôs true, but that didn‚Äôt stop the murals from becoming incredibly famous and influential. Artists flocked from all over Europe to see the parts that were finished and the cartoons, the initial drawings that established the vision of what would come. I think one of the other reasons that Leonardo never finished the battle of Anghiari was that he was more interested in science and technology than ever before. He was conducting experiments and research with more and more of his time. And actually at this time he has the opportunity to become an advisor to someone named Cesare Borgia. Borgia was the illegitimate son of the pope at the time. And he is a conqueror and adventurer. He had managed to carve out a territory for himself in central Italy, and as he‚Äôs doing that, he comes up to the city of Florence, who I just mentioned are not great warriors. And so he says, hey guys, I'm going to take your town unless you happen to want to give me a bunch of money. And they say, that sounds great to us. So they essentially bribe him away and as part of the package, as a token of goodwill, they send Borgia two of their great minds. So they send him Leonardo DaVinci to be a military engineer and an artist. And they send him Niccolo Machiavelli. Machiavelli is one of the great philosophers and political scientists of all time. He's best known for his book, The Prince. And actually Machiavellia and DaVinci get to know each other quite well in Borgia‚Äôs service. In fact at one point they wintered together in this small walled town only a few block across in each direction. And for months Niccolo Machiavelli, DaVinci, and Borgia, are stuck together in this little town, walking around, talking, planning, plotting. And it‚Äôs one of those moments where if I could choose to be a fly on the wall at any time period in history, their conversations are one of those things I would most like to hear.

Three of history ‚Äô s Leonardo Da Vinci (Part 2): greatest and most interesting geniuses all in the same room. So in his service, DaVinci does a number of things. He makes some suggestions that are practical, some that are not. He tells him that he needs to curve all of his castle walls. Why? Because. Uh, if they're curved, then when a Canon is firing at the castle walls, the cannonballs are more likely to glance off and not do damage to the walls. He also helps design a self-reinforcing bridge. So this is essentially a bridge that you can put up really quickly because it uses boards and poles to reinforce itself without needing any nails. No hammering. His biggest innovation once again combines science and art. And it‚Äôs a map. It‚Äôs essentially the world‚Äôs first modern map of a town or city. Da Vinci takes his odometer and very carefully measures out exactly the dimensions of the city and he draws an exact overhead map. It's extremely accurate and is the first map of its kind. Previously maps had been sort of representative, so they just kind of hand wave a lot of the smaller buildings and they show you where the cathedral is and the major roads, but it would not help you understand distances and exactly where everything is, which is what this map does. And this is extremely useful for military planning. It might seem simple but this is a major innovation on the part of Leonardo. Now, eventually Leonardo and Machiavelli leave the service of Borgia. Part of the reason is that their term of service was coming to an end, but at the same time they weren‚Äôt dying to stay in his service. And that‚Äôs because Borgia was a brutal, conniving, ruthless man. You know, if you‚Äôve heard of Machiavelli, it might be because you have heard of the adjective associated with his name. Machiavelli means scheming, ruthless, and unscrupulous. And that‚Äôs because his suggestions in his book were for leaders to be those things when taking and maintaining power. Well Borgia is a little too Machiavellian, even for Machiavelli, the man himself. So there is There's one time in particular, where they take over a town, and the town surrenders. They offer to let Borgia come in unopposed. And he says that‚Äôs fine, bring your notable men to the town square at such and such a time and we‚Äôll take over command of the city from them.

{"text": "‚Äô s fine , bring your notable men to the town square at such and such a time and we ‚Äô ll take over command of the city from them . When the men show up , Borgia has them strangled to death and sets his men loose to pillage Leonardo Da Vinci (Part 2): and loot the city. And so Machiavelli writes in his personal diary. ‚ÄúThe sack of the town continues, although it is now the 23rd hour. I am much troubled.‚Äù And so if you're doing things that trouble Niccolo, Machiavelli, like you are way over the line. Right? And this ruthlessness would help lead to Borgia‚Äôs downfall in the long run, and in the short run, it may have hastened Leonardo and Machiavelli‚Äôs decisions to leave his service. So whether just because their time of service ran out, or because they're troubled by this kind of behavior, after about a year, Machiavelli and DaVinci leave the service of Cesare Borgia and go back to Florence. In Florence though, DaVinci continues to be a military and civil engineer, as well as an artist. He attempts two really ambitious waterworks project, one as a military venture to try to divert a river from a city, and another to drain some marshes around Florence. They were both technically feasible, but too grand to actually work. And this is considered a flaw of Da Vinci. He spends a lot of time working on inventions and ideas that, while interesting, would not be anywhere close to feasible in his lifetime. We‚Äôre talking helicopters, scuba gear, machine guns, airplanes, diverting entire rivers, things like that. And yes, I agree, it's a flaw. Because he spends a lot of time on stuff that never happens. But it's also, I think, one of the things that makes him great. Walter Isaacson wrote about Da Vinci ‚Äúinnovation requires a reality distortion field. Sometimes fantasies are paths to reality.‚Äù And of course he is comparing him to Steve Jobs there and his famous reality distortion field. But I think he‚Äôs right. Sometimes fantasies are just paths to fantasies. But sometimes they are paths to reality. People who try the impossible end up being wildly successful. Because sometimes they achieve the seemingly impossible. But other times they don‚Äôt, sometimes the impossible actually is impossible, but the point is you don‚Äôt know in advance which is going to be which. So you have to be willing to try the impossible. Well, there was never going to be much appetite in Florence for these ambitious engineering projects.

{"text": "projects . The Florentines were merchants , and they liked nice clean contracts . We pay you money , you deliver us a painting . And so Leonardo started to look abroad again . Specifically , his eyes were now going back to Milan where the French were inviting him Leonardo Da Vinci (Part 2): to return. The French always loved Da Vinci. And of course they loved his painting but they were more open to all of his ideas. Whereas the Florentines wanted clean commissions, the French believed in aristocratic largesse. And so the governor of Milan is willing to bring him back and give him essentially a blank check to work on whatever he wants to work on. And so Leonardo decides that that is a good deal and in 1508 he returns to Milan. The art that he produces during this time of his life is much more limited because what he really wants to work on at this time is furthering his scientific work. So this is a good time to take a step back and take a look at his scientific contributions. He made some contributions in math. In geometry mainly and it‚Äôs done through collaboration with a guy named Pacioli. This actually starts in his first stint in Milan. So back in the late 14 hundreds, it's now 1508. Pacioli did a book on something called the Golden Ratio, which is this particularly interesting ratio that is found in nature and mathematics. And he has Da Vinci do the illustrations. So he illustrates all of these three dimensional polygons and shapes. Of course it‚Äôs beautifully done and only Da Vinci could have done it. Only he had both the artistic and mathematical skills to understand and produce these illustrations. That's his biggest formal contribution. He was also just obsessed with math problems, puzzles and riddles. His diaries and filled with pages and pages of these little math riddles. One of the most interesting to him was figuring out how to square a circle. So in other words, how to take a circle and find the measurements of a square with an equivalent area. It‚Äôs pretty tough to do at a time when pi had not been discovered. The biographer, Kenneth Clark writes. That, these attempts to solve this problem are ‚Äúof no interest to mathematicians and of even less interest to art historians.‚Äù And I get that perspective. Because you think man, how much better would it be if we had four or five more DaVinci paintings instead of these useless little squares and circles. But at the same time, You know, this is someone who was so curious and that's what made him such a great painter and such a great scientist and so great at so many things. And so he had to follow that curiosity, wherever it led him. And sometimes it led him in very interesting and fruitful directions and other times it didn't.

{"text": "and such a great scientist and so great at so many things . And so he had to follow that curiosity , wherever it led him . And sometimes it led him in very interesting and fruitful directions and other times it didn ' t . It reminds me a Leonardo Da Vinci (Part 2): little bit of Isaac Newton. Newton was obsessed with, the Bible and with figuring out when the end of the world was going to be, when the apocalypse would occur, based on numerology and reading tea leaves from the bible. And he was obsessed with alchemy. People similarly think that's a waste of Isaac Newton, but similarly, he was just following his curiosity wherever it led him. And sometimes it led him in productive areas and other times not. It also reminds me of Walt Disney and his toy trains. And that seemed like a totally crazy obsession when he was supposed to be leading a film studio, but it ended up leading to Disneyland. The point is, you can‚Äôt necessarily know in advance what is going to be productive and what isn‚Äôt so the best policy at least in the case of geniuses like Da Vinci, Newton, and Disney, is to follow your curiosity no matter what. One of the areas that was more productive was anatomy and biology. This is probably where his greatest scientific contributions come from. He made an attempt to chart out and understand the entire human body. He wanted to understand every element of it. So he makes a list of topics that he wants to explore about the human body in his journals. He writes: What nerve is the cause of the eyes movement and makes the movement of one eye move the other?What nerve is the cause of closing the eyelid? Of raising the eyebrows? Of parting lips with teeth clenched? Of bringing the lips to a point of laughing or expressing wonder? Set yourself to describe the beginning of man when he's created in the womb. And why an infant of eight months does not live. What sneezing is, what yawning is, epilepsy, spasm, paralysis, fatigue, hunger, sleep, thirst, sensuality. What nerve causes the movement of the thigh. And from the knee to the foot and from the ankle to the toes. And Da Vinci really went out and tried to figure out ALL OF THIS. He made hundreds of drawings of the human body and wrote more than 13,000 words about his findings. He made discoveries that wouldn't be matched for hundreds of years. Walter Isaacson writes ‚ÄúAs far as it is now known, he became the first person in history to describe fully the human dental elements, including a depiction of the roots that is almost perfect. If there were not so much else to remember him for, Leonardo could have been celebrated as a pioneer of dentistry.‚Äù I mean, just think", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/leonardo-da-vinci-part-2", "title": "Leonardo Da Vinci (Part 2)", "chunk_index": 15, "publication_date": "2023-05-23", "total_chunks_in_doc": 23}}
{"text": "in history to describe fully the human dental elements , including a depiction of the roots that is almost perfect . If there were not so much else to remember him for , Leonardo could have been celebrated as a pioneer of dentistry . ‚Äù I mean , just think Leonardo Da Vinci (Part 2): about that. He could have been famous as the father of dentistry if he hadn‚Äôt been such a great painter. He also has these important skull drawings - the most accurate depictions of the skull made up to that point, - He discovers how the aorta works in the heart. He discovered that blood did not originate in the liver. He also measures all these proportions in comparison to one another. So he writes the space between the mouth and the nose is one seventh of the face. From the mouth to the bottom of the chin is one fourth of the face and equal to the width of the mouth. The space from the chin to the base of the nose is one third of the face and equal to the length of the nose into the forehead. And he doesn‚Äôt stop with the face he does the arms the legs the torso‚Ä¶ everything. Part of the way he knew this was he dissected over 20 bodies in his life, including a 100 year old man. And I'm in these dissections, he's able to use some of his art techniques. So this is again, a little bit of how art is able to influence science. So for example he wants to be able to see the inside of a brain, but your brain is very wet, very liquid, and brains tend to fall apart when dissecting them. And he figured out how to do a casting of a human brain in order to diagram the inside of it. The way you might cast a statue. So he pours in hot wax and let‚Äôs it fill in all the chambers and folds to get a good diagram of what it looks like on the inside. Now unfortunately, most of this knowledge did not make its way into the scientific community. It all has to be rediscovered later by others. Because he didn't publish any of it. He was very collaborative. He's always talking with people. He's always sharing his findings. He wasn't secretive at all, but the fact that he didn‚Äôt publish means it doesn‚Äôt become a part of the scientific consensus and doesn‚Äôt get shared throughout the scientific community. He meant to publish, he was always half gathering things into manuscripts and then abandoning them. And in anatomy, this is the biggest shame because he was so close. So he had a brief collaboration with this professor from the university of Padua, which is pretty close to Milan, with a professor named MarcAntonio Delatorre.

And so they were going to collaborate on a book and this is good because Latorre is better at finishing things and publishing than DaVinci is, and so they make a lot of progress. It's going great. And then a big plague sweeps through Italy and it kills him, kills De Latorre. And this is pretty painful to read about because if he hadn‚Äôt died, their anatomy textbook probably would have revolutionized the science of the human body. They could have advanced understanding of the human body by decades, maybe even centuries. But it was not to be. The man dies. And to me it just goes to show the power of having good collaborators. That is the main thing that Da Vinci was missing from his scientific endeavors. Now we won‚Äôt get into all of his other scientific inquiries, although his mind was incredibly far reaching. He studied physics, astronomy, the anatomy of animals, ecosystems, and a lot of other things and made some pretty brilliant realizations. But unfortunately because of his failure to publish none of this really becomes a part of his legacy. It‚Äôs just something that we get to see and marvel at as we look through his notebooks. Just one other thing I‚Äôll highlight is his experiments with water. He wanted to understand how it flowed and moved. And as part of that, he came up with an experiment to throw blades of grass into a river - so that by observing the grass he could see what water went where. So for example he realizes that waves don‚Äôt actually move water. He sees the grass bob up and down and realizes that a wave is energy moving through water but the water actually just bobs up and down. So in his journal he writes how to conduct this experiment with grass and water and he writes ‚Äúfrom this experiment, you'll be able to proceed to investigate many beautiful movements, which result from one element penetrating into another.‚Äù And I think that is a really important insight into the mind to DaVinci. He describes the movement of the water as beautiful. I think beauty was a huge motivator for him. For both his art and his science. You will be able to proceed to investigate many beautiful movements. Which result from one element penetrating into another. And I think fundamentally that is why he investigated all of this stuff.

If you actually just go to Steve jobs archive.com you can find it. I'm going to do an episode on it shortly. And he is always talking about how beautiful and elegant his products are. He was always striving for aesthetic perfection. He‚Äôs got a great quote, he says ‚ÄúOne of the ways that I believe people express their appreciation to the rest of humanity is to make something wonderful and put it out there.‚Äù And just think about it. Let‚Äôs say you are a professor of anatomy, and you‚Äôre studying the human body because that is your job and it‚Äôs how you make money. Let‚Äôs even take it a step further and say you think your work is crucially important, for the good of humanity. And you‚Äôre competing against someone who is absolutely transfixed by the beauty and elegance of the human body. Who is going to stay at the dissecting table longer? Who is going to work harder? The person who is working hard because they think they should? Or the person who is transfixed by the beauty of what they are working on. We hear a lot of advice these days about finding a career that you are passionate about, and I think that‚Äôs good advice. But I think passion is difficult to define and even more difficult to find. I think beauty is another way of thinking about it that is potentially more helpful. Work on something that you find beautiful. And whether you are a technologist like Steve Jobs or an artist or a scientist like Da Vinci, you‚Äôre going to be successful and you‚Äôre going to enjoy it. So a lot of this scientific progress happens in his second stint in Milan. It was very fruitful for him scientifically, but it didn‚Äôt last forever. So the first time in Milan he is serving the duke of Milan, this guy named Sforza. The second time he‚Äôs serving the French. But then in 1513, the French get kicked out out, and so once again, Leonardo gets out of dodge. He moves to Rome briefly where he finds a patron. His patron is a Medici actually, who had moved from Florence to Rome.

This is especially stark because the other star artists of his court , Raphael Leonardo Da Vinci (Part 2): and Michelangelo, are in their prime and are able to churn out a lot of artwork. One of the few works he actually does complete at this time is St. John the Baptist. And this is, I think, one of his most interesting pieces. I like it. I'm disturbed by it. It's very dark. And John is drawn as very androgynous, and he‚Äôs drawn very sensually. I mean it‚Äôs honestly a pretty errotic painting. He‚Äôs giving this sort of come higher look at the viewer. And so, when I look at it, I feel, almost violated, John sort of imposes himself upon you. He‚Äôs trying to seduce you. It‚Äôs a pretty amazing effect. But for that reason, it‚Äôs not popular, no one really knows what to do with it. A French cataloger in 1625 is logging this painting, which is supposed to be a religious work of art. And he's like this one's no good. He writes ‚ÄúIt does not please, because it does not arouse feelings of devotion.‚Äù Which I think is an understatement. There's even a sketch version of it that was found in his workshop that was probably done by his disciple and companion Salai, which features John with full-on female breasts and an erect phallus. So Leonardo definitely knew what he was doing, if this is something that he was joking about in his workshop. I think on a certain level this painting represents Leonardo dropping the curtain on his sexuality a little bit and feeling less inhibited. He's not in Rome for that long. He‚Äôs there from 1513 to 1516 when he is invited by the king of France to move to France. And the king of France, his name is Francis the first. And he is Leonardo's true patron that he had been looking for his entire life. Francis is a warrior. He‚Äôs a man‚Äôs man. He is tall, broad shouldered, charismatic, and courageous. He was also a civilized and decent man. And he didn't think of himself as a scholar, but he did love scientific and artistic achievement. And so he‚Äôs obsessed with Leonardo.

He has a stroke that leaves one of his hands paralyzed. But he lectures, he researches, he reads, and he tinkers. And he continues to polish and put some finishing touches on the Mona Lisa and a couple other pieces that he carried with him. Finally at the end of his life, he finds his ideal living arrangement. Going and doing as he pleases, constantly well supplied and well funded by his patron with no strings attached and no demands. His health is steadily deteriorating and on May 2nd, 1519, he dies in the arms of King Francis, who loved him so much that he wanted to be with him even until the very end. So let's talk about some takeaways. The first is DaVinci's method for observation. It‚Äôs how he learns anything. This is what he wrote. ‚ÄúIf you wish to have a sound knowledge of the form of objects. Begin with the details of them. And do not go on to the second step until you have the first one. Well fixed in memory.‚Äù Okay. It seems pretty clear. Go detail to detail and then, um, don't move on from one until you can recall it from memory - you really have it figured out, then go onto the next detail. So there's an example of this. He wants to figure out how birds fly. This is one of his scientific inquiries. It probably had implications for his paintings, as well as some of the pageantry that he was doing and potentially for his engineering as he was trying to create a flying machine at the time. So he breaks down how he‚Äôs going to do this. He writes ‚ÄúFirst define the motion of the wind and then describe how the bird steer through it with only the simple balancing of the wings. With only the simple balancing of the wings. Do this after the description of their anatomy.‚Äù First, describe the anatomy of a bird. Second, describe the motion of the wind. So how does wind move? What does that look like? And then third, how do the two interact? How does the anatomy of a bird interact with the motion of the wind in order to create flight. And using this process he comes up with the most accurate description of the physics of the flight of birds ever discovered. So this is a pretty simple method, but I think it‚Äôs powerful. List out everything you need to understand first,", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/leonardo-da-vinci-part-2", "title": "Leonardo Da Vinci (Part 2)", "chunk_index": 20, "publication_date": "2023-05-23", "total_chunks_in_doc": 23}}

So this is a pretty simple method , but I think it ‚Äô s powerful . List out everything you need to understand first , Leonardo Da Vinci (Part 2): and then go through step by step, only moving on once you have truly mastered a subject. Another big lesson for me is don't get bogged down in what you should do. Relentlessly follow your curiosity. And obviously that has some tradeoffs, Da Vinci left a lot of things unfinished. But that's what made him Da Vinci. I think the best approach for him would have been to find partners who could help him gather, organize, and publish his thoughts. But the thing that made him so special was that he was SO curious and he allowed himself to pursue that curiosity relentlessly. Focusing too much on what you ‚Äúshould‚Äù do rather than what interests you I think is a recipe for unhappiness and wasted potential. Following your curiosity is worth it. My next takeaway is be an experimenter. Obviously, I believe in book learning, that‚Äôs kind of the point of this podcast. Early in his life, DaVinci looked down on book learning. He as very skeptical of it. He wrote: ‚ÄúThough, I have no power to quote from authors as others have. I shall rely on a far more worthy thing. On experience. He who has access to the fountain does not go to the water jar.‚Äù Now was time went on, he softened to the idea of book learning. And he did quite a bit of reading. But I guess that's the point. He started with experience and practice and only the moved on to book learning. Let‚Äôs take an example. Let‚Äôs say you are someone who has never played basketball before. Never. And you start studying Michael Jordan. Read every book. Watched every interview. Watched all his game tape, broke down and learned every move. Do you think you would improve? Of course not. But let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre Kobe Bryant and you‚Äôre playing basketball every day, and you being studying everything about Michael Jordan. Reading the books, watching the game tape. Would he improve? We know the answer to that question because that‚Äôs exactly what he did. So you have to start with experience, and THEN move on to book learning. And whatever you do learn about in books or podcasts you should immediately try to put it into practice or you‚Äôre just wasting time. And then my final takeaway is about that question that I opened with? How does art spur science and technology? And to me it goes back to what I mentioned, that beauty is what motivated Leonardo.

And to me it goes back to what I mentioned , that beauty is what motivated Leonardo . His art helped him to see Leonardo Da Vinci (Part 2): and recognize beauty. And beauty is what motivated him to explore these topics of science and technology. He marveled at the human body, at rivers, and trees, and birds, and flight, and cities, and geometric shapes. I think that‚Äôs the reason he was so good at geometry and so bad at algebra. Because he couldn‚Äôt see any beauty in an equation but he could in circles and squares. Because he saw that beauty, he really LOVED what he was working on. And that‚Äôs what made him so great, that love for humanity, that love for art, that love for the natural world. I want to bring up a quote that I brought up in episode one. He was writing it at the time when he was in some legal trouble, and it might seem trivial, but I think it really sums up who Leonardo was. He wrote: ‚ÄúIf there is no love, then what?‚Äù Thank you for listening to how to take over the world.

Today I'll be talking about some more of my takeaways from my conversation with him, as well as some more takeaways from just knowing him and being able to observe how he works. And then I'll also talk a little bit about my history with him, how it is that he came to be interviewed on the podcast. And then I'll also talk about my history with him and how it is that he came to be interviewed on the Pat. I'll start off with my biggest takeaway, because that is something that I want everyone to hear. So that would be for the free version, and then I'll go into, uh, my history with MrBeast, how we came to know each other. And then I'll go through some more of my takeaways. So to start off, my biggest takeaway, the thing that I'm thinking the most about after having done this, and having watched it a few times now. is obsession, and specifically how MrBeast approaches obsession reminds me a lot of others. You know, MrBeast himself talked a little bit about addiction. He said that, you know, the way he approaches YouTube is an addiction, and it just happens to be a positive one. and listen to this clip where he talks about, How he approaches them, how he deals with those other obsessions that pop up. Take a listen. Yeah, that's one thing I've found, which I do not recommend to anyone else, but I just like to give into my impulses and like, for whatever reason, work always pulls me back. And so like, if you know, when, when I literally, this is a perfect example. When I first played Catan with one of my friends, he introduced it to me. We played for 36 hours straight, like, well, I, he didn't, but we played for like 10 hours. And then he wanted to go to bed. So I got another three people to play with me, played overnight. And I got those same people to come back in the morning at like 9am. We played for like 10 hours. And then we, I cycled through like 16 different people before I finally crashed. Like, and like, sure. I could have played for three hours, gone to bed at a reasonable", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/mr-beast-interview", "title": "Mr Beast Interview", "chunk_index": 0, "publication_date": "2024-02-08", "total_chunks_in_doc": 5}}

I could have played for three hours , gone to bed at a reasonable Mr Beast Interview: time, worked all day, then played at night. But. It's like that doesn't for whatever reason that doesn't work for me when I want to do something I just want to do it right and like if I want to play this game I try to just get it all in my system and just burn myself out on it And then when I wake up the next day, I'm like, okay back to work, you know what I mean? I don't think this is optimal, but I, I tend to be a little more impulse driven. And so I know these are the things I have to do today, but what order it's going to happen, God knows. I'm just, I mean, I, I kind of like, you know, and again, it might not be effective and ideally with not people whose time is super valuable, but if it's like. You know, I know I have to do these five phone calls, just tell them at any point, Jimmy's going to call, make it where it doesn't go to voicemail or ringer or whatever, and make sure, you know, they have it set where when I call, it just goes through. And I'd prefer it to be like that. So in between meetings or blah, blah, whatever. I'm like, really, my brain is focused on that. Um, I can just get them done as opposed to just being like, it has to be in this time or this, because you just don't know. I might, my brain might be in a different gear because I was working on a different project and it's just kind of hard to just like gear switch on demand 30 times a day. I've just found for me. Which is probably a bad thing, but just giving in to my impulses and doing what they tell me to do has worked well. And when I try to have a regimented structure lifestyle, it's just not fun. And like, you have to have some level of enjoyment if you're gonna like, grind every single day for crazy hours for 20 years straight. That's something that I see throughout a lot of really successful people throughout history, is they don't have these elaborate morning routines. They don't have these really elaborate or strict schedules.

Probably the most notable example is Leonardo da Vinci , who , you know , often Mr Beast Interview: didn't finish things because he only wanted to wake up and work on whatever it was that he was obsessed with. And it's exactly what Jimmy was describing. I'm not saying that Jimmy's Leonardo da Vinci. He's very good at YouTube. He's not that level of artist, but yeah, you know, da Vinci, uh, there's this great quote, uh, someone's explaining his work style and they say essentially. Some days he would come in first thing in the morning and would just paint all day, like, like, until he passed out at night. And then other days he would come in, take a look at it, and go, no, not today, and just walk out. Naval Ravikant, a very famous entrepreneur explained it this way. There's a quote from him. He said, quote, the way people tend to work most effectively, especially in knowledge work is to sprint as hard as they can while they feel inspired to work. and then rest. They take long breaks. It's more like a lion hunting and less like a marathon or running. You sprint and then you rest. You reassess and then you try again. You end up building a marathon of sprints. And I think that quote is great. It really explains, I think, a lot about what Jimmy is describing here and Da Vinci and a lot of these people. They just wake up and work on whatever it is that they are obsessed with. And that's actually how So this podcast got started. , I was reading this biography of Napoleon. I knew I wanted to make a podcast out of it. I kind of figured what it would be and had some things in my head. But I just really wanted to work on it. And so what I did is I deleted all of my social media accounts. Uh, not just deactivated them, not just deleted them off my phone, but actually deleted my social media accounts. So that I have nothing to distract me. And then for a week, I just woke up and every day, the first thing I did when I woke up, I didn't brush my teeth. I didn't shower. I didn't eat breakfast. I woke up, I rolled out of bed and I started working on this podcast. I started taking notes. I started scripting and I recorded and that was it.

And that was what gave me the energy and momentum to get Mr Beast Interview: this thing off the ground. And I really think there's something special that happens when you take that approach, when you clear everything out. And you, when you clear everything out and it's the first thing that you focus on and it's what you think about all day and it's what you think about when you go to sleep, if you can find an obsession like that, and if you can clear your schedule and you can clear your life so that you can dedicate that level of focus to something, you get exponential results. You know, in, in that one week I finished the Napoleon episode. I designed this song, my intro song that has become kind of famous. And I think is a big part of frankly, the success of the podcast. Um, I figured out how to do a podcast, which like it wasn't early days of podcasting, but it wasn't as easy then as it is now to kind of figure out how to do a podcast and get it off the ground. Um, I did the initial cover art. Like I just, I got the whole thing done in a week. I think I may. Have at least started or may have finished the Steve Jobs episodes in that one week as well. So anyway, I know if you have a job, uh, you know, that might not be practical for you. It might not be practical for everyone, but if you can get yourself into a place where you can do that, I promise you the results that you will see are exponential. Even from just like mostly focus when you can really just dedicate all your thoughts and energy to one thing for a whole day. Uh, it's pretty special what happens. So, uh, that's my number one piece of advice is obsess, obsess, obsess, obsess. Don't worry so much about optimizing every little element of your life. Just find one thing at a time. I call it meta focus. In the, in the past, like, yeah, you can, there can be different phases of your life, right? You can have a phase of your life where you don't have as good a balance.

{"text": "Napoleon: As the sun set on December 1st, 1805, the emperors of Russia and Austria felt victory within their grasp. They had the high ground, and the French were retreating in haste. With more men, and better With more men, better position, momentum on their side, the two grand emperors commanding their imperial troops were finally in a position to put that little Corsican upstart Napoleon in his place. As the sun rose on the morning of the 2nd, from those commanding heights, the two emperors looked down on the French forces. They looked small. The emperors must have imagined the French soldiers clutching their muskets, shaking in their boots. It was going to be a good day, with one determined attack, this war was over, they thought. They were right, but not in the way they believed. Eight hours later, more than 30, 000 Austrian and Russian men were dead or captured, and the war was over, with Napoleon victorious. He addressed his men before the day was done. Soldiers, even at this hour, before this great day shall pass away and be lost in the ocean of eternity. Your emperor must address you, and say how satisfied he is with your conduct. The recollection of this day, and of your deeds, will be eternal. But as pleased as he was with his men, Napoleon knew that the day belonged to him alone. Napoleon knew that the day belonged to him alone. His brilliant planning, his prodigious leadership and ability to inspire, is what had really turned the tide. As Napoleon would later write, In war, men are nothing. One man is everything. Today, he was that man. Some historians have suggested that this battle, the Battle of Austerlitz, ruined Napoleon. His victory was so complete in the face of such overwhelming odds that he no longer believed himself capable of defeat. And I think that's probably an exaggeration. But how does something like this warp a man's psyche? Taking on two of the world's greatest armies, taking on two of the world's greatest armies, with inferior position, and crushing them. And crushing them against these overwhelming odds. There's a quote by Steve Jobs, Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact.

And in this second part, I want to move more into his reign as emperor and how he governed. Because even though the life of a military conqueror and emperor might seem remote to us, I do think that there is a ton that can be learned from his life, from his work habits, his tactics, his strategies.

And I might not even want , because I can ' t Napoleon: accomplish what he did. No one is conquering vast pan European empires anymore. And that might be true, but even if you don't imagine yourself a great conqueror or the founder of a nation even if you have more modest goals, I certainly hope you do, Even if you have more modest goals, I suspect that you do, and you just want to be a great entrepreneur, great athlete, great executive, great academic, great professional in whatever sphere. I think this will inspire and motivate you to think bigger than you have been thinking. There's also something I want to mention before we get started, which is this question of was Napoleon a good person? Is he someone admirable? You know, people often juxtapose Napoleon as the liberal reformer with Napoleon as the autocrat. So look, there are a lot of admirable things about Napoleon. However, Napoleon was a tyrant. There are those who want to defend him by saying, no, he wasn't, he was something else. But I think you can only defend Napoleon by acknowledging what and who he truly was. The word tyrant has Greek origins, and any Greek would have looked at Napoleon and said, Yep, that is a tyrant. Textbook case. Zero deviation from the definition. He came to power in the way that was typical of tyrants, he kept his power in the way that was typical of tyrants, and he wielded his power in a way that was typical of tyrants. He is, like, He could not be any more of a stereotypical tyrant. That is what he was, but he wasn't just a tyrant, but that doesn't mean he was just a tyrant. He, but he wasn't just a tyrant, but he wasn't just a tyrant. He was such a genius that he managed to live a beautiful and interesting life and create a number of beautiful and interesting legacies in his tyranny. So I'd encourage you as you listen to this episode, instead of constantly trying to make joke. So I would encourage you when you listen to this episode, instead of constantly trying to make moral judgments of, is this good? Is this bad? First, just try and take in the man. Try and understand who he was. Try and understand who he was from a very objective perspective. And then when it's all said and done, and you have all the information, and you understand him a little better, then you can sit there and make your judgments and find out.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/napoleon", "title": "Napoleon", "chunk_index": 2, "publication_date": "2024-01-16", "total_chunks_in_doc": 41}}

And also we're going to talk about how he administered his empire. Exactly, you know, how he did what he did. We'll talk about the mindset that allowed him to accomplish so much. And we'll also talk about how the same mindset might have fueled him. And we'll talk about how the same mindset that fueled him might have led to his downfall. Because of hubris and his inability to stop. Because of hubris and his inability to stop.

And also instructional, and instructional in both a positive and negative aspect.

The Peace of Amiens created a golden age for France. Thousands of men returned from the army to productivity. üìç The Peace of Amiens created a golden age for France. Thousands of men returned from the army to productive economic activity. Thousands of English tourists flocked to Paris to catch a glimpse of their near neighbor, who had been inaccessible to them for more than a decade because of the Revolutionary Wars. Artistic activity flourished as Paris once again became the cultural center of Europe, and Paris seemed to be one never ending party as locals and visitors celebrated a new age of prosperity and peace. Again, the two countries had been at war for more than a decade, especially in France. Everyone knew someone who had died in the revolutionary wars. It had devastated many, many, many, it had devastated many, many people economically. And after years upon years of violence, it had seemed like it would never end. Now, and now suddenly, very soon after Napoleon had taken power. üìç It was hugely popular in France, and just about everywhere else in the world, too. People usually think of these European wars. People usually think of these as European wars. And that definitely was the main theater of conflict. But the effects of these wars were felt in India, North and South Africa, the United But the effects of these wars were felt in India, North and South Africa, the United States and Canada, the Caribbean, Central and South America, the Middle East, and beyond. In many ways, the phrase World War is a better description of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars than the 20th century conflicts that have received that name. Now just because And so Napoleon was a global icon for the peace that he brought. But just because he was popular doesn't mean that he was safe. Assassination plots against Napoleon continued from disaffected Jacobins. Those Those again are these, those again are these far left revolutionaries. And also from royalists.

{"text": "never higher than it was during the Peace of Amiens . He was 33 years old , in the prime of his life , and in the prime of his abilities as a general , a statesman , and a leader . But , even as people celebrated , the Napoleon: cracks in the peace began to show almost immediately. Amiens had established a solid diplomatic and military understanding between France and Great Britain. But importantly, the Peace of Amiens made no provisions for any economic deal. Napoleon had insisted that their, Napoleon had insisted that no trade deal be included in the overall peace. He said that the diplomatic and military conflict needed to be solved before a trade deal could even be discussed. Well, this is a problem because a major impetus for the British to come to the negotiating table was the prospect of renewed economic activity. Remember, remember, Great Britain was definitely a commercial republic. Trade and their economy was sort of everything to them. Opening up those markets was a vital matter of national interest. And the assumption was that those markets would indeed open up after the peace of Amiens, but no trade deal was forthcoming. The British economy was very well developed and very industrialized. If a free trade deal were reached. British merchants could outcomplete if a free trade deal were reached. British merchants could outcompete their French counterparts in a variety of industries, but especially in textiles and industrial productions, essentially, you know, mass production factories. And so Napoleon was very keen to protect French industry. So in the hoped for economic benefits of the treaty. And so Napoleon was very keen to protect French industry, so he levied very heavy taxes and duties on British merchants who tried to trade within France, and in some cases outright banned their goods from being sold. So when the hoped for, so this deal essentially generates No positive economic benefits for the British. In fact, it generates some negative economic benefit. In fact, it generates some negative economic effects because now they have French competitors where before they did not because of the war. So when the hope for economic benefits of the treaty failed to materialize for the British. They soured on the deal. They were not interested in keeping it going. And when you really boil it down to why the Peace of Amiens failed, the heart of the issue was this. For the British to be satisfied, Napoleon would have to stop his economic competition, which would mean cementing England's place as the world's preeminent power. Both the world's preeminent economic power, and then coming from that, the primary geopolitical power. On the other hand, for the French to be satisfied, the British would have to accept a France who was militarily far superior to the British and economically, quickly rising to become their peer, and economically, quickly rising to become their peer.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/napoleon", "title": "Napoleon", "chunk_index": 5, "publication_date": "2024-01-16", "total_chunks_in_doc": 41}}

On the other hand , for the French to be satisfied , the British would have to accept a France who was militarily far superior to the British and economically , quickly rising to become their peer , and economically , quickly rising to become their peer . Napoleon: In other words, the British would have to give up their spot as the world's foremost economic and geopolitical power. And so sometimes people try and, um, and sometimes, and so sometimes people try and portray the breakdown of the Peace of Amiens as this very irrational thing. That if the French and British had just been able to come together and talk this out, uh, everything would have been simpatico. I don't think so. They were locked in a death struggle to be the preeminent power in the world. And fundamentally, there were conflicts there. And fundamentally, there were national interest conflicts there. peace in one setting would mean that Britain would continue to be That peace in one setting would continue to mean that Britain would be superior to French. that the peace would have to have rules that would facilitate the superiority of either England or France. And so while the Peace of Amiens provided a breath of fresh air for everyone involved, it failed relatively quickly. It was ultimately the French who benefited the most from the peace. And it was, in my mind at least, ultimately the British who broke the pact. But that doesn't mean Napoleon was blameless. He continued to flex his power abroad during the peace. This included interference in Switzerland, imposed French authority, and an unfortunate incident where he sent French troops into a neutral country, Baden, a part of present day Germany, in order to capture and execute an aristocrat who he suspected of plotting to assassinate him. And as it turns out, he was probably wrong about this. And it was a diplomatic disaster. It contributed to the impression that Napoleon was an endlessly ambitious dictator bent on world domination. It would have been very difficult for England to accept France as a second preeminent power on par with themselves under any circumstances. But Napoleon's belligerence and meddling made the very difficult basically impossible. So the Treaty of Amiens was signed in March of 1802. And it breaks down just over a year later, in May of 1803, when Britain declared war on France. It was a surprise declaration of war, which allowed Britain to seize hundreds of French and Dutch merchant ships, and steal more than two million pounds worth of goods. Additionally, all the crews were taken Additionally, all the crews were taken as prisoners of war. In retaliation, Napoleon has over 1, 100 British nationals in France imprisoned.

He badly wanted to strike a blow at England itself. Hello. Napoleon's first move was to assemble a giant invasion force In northern France, on the coast. He badly wanted to strike a blow at England itself. And it must have been tantalizing for him. At its narrowest point, the English Channel is only 21 miles across. He could practically reach out and touch it. If he could just get across those 20 miles, there would be no one to stop him. He has this quote, you can hear him just yearning. He said, quote, It is necessary for us to be masters of the sea for six hours only. and England will cease to exist. He said, it is necessary for us to be masters of the sea for six hours only, and England will have ceased to exist. And yet he never could gain mastery of the channel, not even for six hours. The British Navy was just too powerful. And so his army waited and waited. Facing the Channel, Cursing the Channel, Cursing the English, but all in vain. Well, as Britain adds allies to their coalition, Napoleon decides that he can no longer afford to have his best army kicking rocks on the beach, and so he renames it from the Army of England to Le Grande Arm√©e. And he turns it East to take on the Austrians and Russians, who are, once again, threatening to invade French territory. Now, for a while, Napoleon had been moving his forces towards something that would ultimately come to be known as the Core System. And this campaign is where the corps system would fully emerge. This is how Andrew Roberts describes it. Each corps was effectively a mini army, with its own infantry, cavalry, artillery, staff, intelligence, engineering, transport, victualing, pay, medical and commissary sections, intended to work in close connection with other corps. Moving within one day's march of each other, they allowed Napoleon to swap around the rearguard, vanguard, or reserve at a moment's notice. So in other words, um, so in other words, if that wasn't clear, you, so in other words, if that wasn't clear, what Napoleon is doing here is you have these mini armies, which allows you.

{"text": "' t clear , you , so in other words , if that wasn ' t clear , what Napoleon is doing here is you have these mini armies , which allows you . So in other words , if that wasn ' t clear , Napoleon is dividing up Napoleon: his army into these mini armies, which he calls core, which allows you to move really quickly because they can travel slightly different routes and live off the land and they're very flexible and the system is great for seeking out and destroying an enemy. Because a single corps can engage an enemy army and hold its own for a day while it waits for the rest of the corps to show up and reinforce it. It's very innovative and would soon prove to be very deadly. Well, the speed, the speed at which the corps move allow them to completely surround the lead Austrian army and cut off their line of retreat. Now, I should add that it's not just the corps system that is keeping them moving fast. Cough, cough, cough. Napoleon was obsessed with speed, and incredibly impatient. The two went hand in hand. He ate quickly. He spoke quickly. He moved quickly. He did everything quickly because he always wanted to be moving forward, getting ahead. Andrew Roberts calls impatience, quote, The most constant of all Napoleon's military, They march so quickly that Napoleon doesn't have dry clothing or his normal supplies for dinner and has to eat an omelette made of country eggs for dinner. They move so breathtakingly fast that by the time the Austrians even find out about the presence of the French army, they are already surrounded. Can you imagine that? A hundred and seventy thousand men. This is not a small army. And the first thing you hear about them They have surrounded you and cut you off. There are some very minor battles as the Austrians make some weak attempts to break out. But ultimately, the Austrian army is forced to surrender. Twenty But ultimately, the army is forced to surrender. More than 40, 000 men, 3, 300 cavalry, and 60 cannons are captured virtually without a shot being fired. This comes to be known as the Battle of Ulm, which is the city where the Austrians were as the Battle of Ulm, besieged and ultimately surrendered. But it's kind of a misnomer to call it the Battle of Ulm. It's more like the non Battle of Ulm. Napoleon had to say about it, quote, I have carried out all my plans. I have destroyed the Austrian army simply by marching. But Napoleon, with his characteristic impatience, pushes on. He was impatient even when ahead of schedule.

There's a story that a captured Austrian soldier sees Napoleon and Napoleon is helping push some cannons through the mud. And his imperial uniform is spattered with dirt and mud. And the Austrian soldier expresses his surprise that an emperor, and not just an emperor, but an emperor of the greatest empire in Europe right now, would be doing this kind of work. Napoleon responds to him, quote, Your master wanted to remind me that I am a soldier. I hope he will own that the imperial purple has not caused me to forget my first trade. What a cool response. Your emperor wanted to cut me down to size and remind me that I'm nothing but a soldier. Well, he was right. I haven't forgotten that I am a soldier, and I'm still a pretty good one. want to take the time to highlight just one note that I made here. And it's this thing that pops up in all the biographies that you read about Napoleon. And that is, in every one of them, the wars that he fights typically take the leading role in the narrative of his life. But then you get to all these random sentences that pop up, like this one. Uh, I think this one is from the Roberts biography. It says, quote, On September 10th, Napoleon took time that day to instruct the 53 year old Pierre Forfay On September 10th, Napoleon took time that day to instruct the 53 year old Pierre Forfay, Prefect of Genoa, to stop taking his young mistress, a Roman girl who is no more than a prostitute, to the theater. So, Napoleon was the emperor, and he was a man with a military background, but he was a genuine head of state with direct control and responsibility for every aspect of French government, and really every aspect of French life. He was making decisions about education, infrastructure, entertainment, public works, um, urban design, policing, espionage, society, social affairs, industry, banking, um, the financial situation, monetary policy, science and research, diplomacy, religion, and the relationship with the Catholic Church, freedom of religion, trade, waterways and navigation, not to mention his rather obvious oversight of the army and the navy.

You might imagine him , you might imagine him like the president of the United States , who has certain areas where he ' s expected to Napoleon: have a certain level of control, you know, like defense, homeland security, and then other areas where he might have no direct input at all. And other areas where he might have no direct input at all. Basically leaves it all to, uh, permanent professional staff who keep things going. But that is not how the French Empire but that was not how the French Empire worked at all. Napoleon was a true chief executive. And of course he delegated, but he was really ultimately responsible for everything that happened. There was no one else who he could shift blame onto. There was no Congress, no Parliament that could block his actions, no existing set of laws to stymie him. That was all replaced with the Napoleonic Code. So even though he obviously delegated the vast majority of the actual implementation of these efforts, he had an understanding of, and a vision for, all these areas that I just highlighted. So how do you do that? How in the world could you possibly take on responsibility in all these different domains? How can you possibly So how do you do that? How could you possibly actually be the chief executive of all those functions at once? And the answer is that you have to have a frankly insane capacity to digest information and spit out instructions. And that is exactly what Napoleon had. He was naturally gifted with an extraordinary intellect and memory. I mean, truly like a top 0. 001 percent brain, but he was also served by a record keeping and secretarial system that increased the efficiency of all his actions. I don't know what to call it. The term I'm using in my own head is a management apparatus. It's a little clunky. I'm workshopping it. But I think it conveys this idea that he had like a second brain. They had like a second brain to mag. To multiply and magnify all of his actions. I think a little bit of it, like a, I think of it a little bit like a Gundam. If you know what that is, or if any of you are like my age and you watch Power Rangers growing up, they had Megazords, which are like these big suits, like a big robot suit, right?

{"text": "big robot suit , right ? So you move your right arm and this huge robot moves its right arm . It ' s kind of like that , right ? He could make one little decision and In the first episode , I talked about a letter he wrote Napoleon: to the French government when they were trying to split his command. And he said, quote, I have gained some advantages over very superior forces. While in an almost destitute condition, because I was persuaded of your entire confidence in me, my moves were as prompt as my thoughts. And that is really the goal of his management apparatus, to make his moves as prompt as his thoughts across a variety of domains. Or, if I could rephrase it to something a little more catchy, I would call it moving at the speed of thought. Napoleon was the great brain of the French Empire, and all the friction around that brain was removed. So what did that actually look like? Well, for example, he had these record books and the books were very similar across domains. So for example, in the army book, you would have a brigade and its commander and its home base and its troop numbers and so on all this information about this brigade. But then every effort was made to make the columns match up as closely as possible. In the naval books, where you'd have a ship, and its captain, and its home base, and a number of sailors, and it would look very, very similar to the army record book. And efforts were even made to make things line up in the record book for public works, and finances, and so on, so that Napoleon wouldn't have to reset how he was taking in information if he moved from, say, a record book on the armies of Germany to a record book of the roads in northern Italy. In his output, friction was similarly reduced. He had a secretary ready to take his dictation around the clock. All he had to do was walk into his office and say, Write, and then start dictating, and the secretary would start writing whatever he said. In fact, it went beyond that. For military matters, Napoleon didn't need to fill In fact, it went beyond that. For military matters, Napoleon didn't even need to fill in all the details because his chief of staff, Berthier, was a genius at taking Napoleon's thoughts, even his most vague of instructions, and turning them into specific commands. Napoleon might say, have the Third Corps move south and cut off the Austrians rear. And once Napoleon was done dictating, Berthier would make sure the Corps knew which road to take, what to do if the Austrians engaged, what to do if they didn't, where to stay, when they", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/napoleon", "title": "Napoleon", "chunk_index": 11, "publication_date": "2024-01-16", "total_chunks_in_doc": 41}}

Napoleon was a very detail oriented person, so for some very important operations, he would get into that level of detail himself. But because he needed to command so much at such speed, he mostly left those details to Berthier or to other subordinates, especially if they were people he knew he could trust. And by the way, Napoleon's commitment to moving fast and getting work done efficiently was extreme. So generally, he would go to bed quite early, and then he would wake up around midnight or 1 a. m., receive any reports that had come in, issue the day's instructions so that everyone had their orders when they woke up, And then go back to bed around 3 a. m. and sleep the rest of the night. And this was done so that when everyone woke up, they had their orders in hand from the emperor. No time was lost assessing the situation, waiting for orders, or anything like that. Everyone was just ready to move. And when he was on campaign, his same staff would issue orders and instructions for everything. So he might be issuing movement orders for his army, and then get a letter and have to make a decision about the placement of a girls school in Paris. And his same secretarial staff could fire off letters for both things. Napoleon was so extreme about the efficiency with which he worked that he wouldn't even set down letters that he had just read. He just let them drop to the floor and began reading the next letter. would scurry in later when he was done and scoop up the discarded letters and file them as appropriate. And of course there were many layers to this And of course there were many layers to this Napoleon had a specially designed carriage to facilitate his filing system He had his palace specially he had the rooms in his palace specially designed to facilitate his habit of midnight work He had a custom desk, but rather than going into every detail He had a custom desk He had a custom desk.

One other thing that I will mention is that one of the reasons that the Austrians had moved so far forward and were able to be surrounded by Napoleon at the Battle of Napoleon: Ulm is because they had learned from his invasions of Italy. And they thought, okay, this Napoleon guy, he moves fast. So we need to move fast, we need to copy him. But you don't move fast just because you want to. Napoleon's entire life was bent around the idea of speed, his staff setup, the way his army was supplied, the way he organized his command structure, Even his obsession with his men's shoes. He was constantly writing letters about the quality and quantity of his soldier's shoes because he wanted to make sure that they could literally physically march quickly. So everything was built around speed. You don't become fast just by wanting to be fast. You could be You don't become fast just by wanting to be fast. You become fast by making it the center of everything you do and building systems that enable you to go fast. Well, having defeated one Austrian army at Ulm, Napoleon still had to deal with the rest of the Austrian armies as well as the Russians. With his usual speed, he blitzed through Central Europe and into Austria, taking their capital of Vienna. The Austrians, however, did not surrender just because they had lost their capital. They were still waiting for a decisive battle, and with their emperor They were still waiting for a decisive battle, and their emperor was still in the field with the main body of their forces. Now, now, the primary Russian general, his name was Kutuzov, and he wanted to keep retreating into Russia. Drag the French out, extend their supply lines, which now stretch through hostile Austria, and let the French exhaust themselves before trying to fight them. But the Austrians were obviously not keen. on letting their country stay occupied by the French. And the Russian emperor, Alexander, who was marching with his army, was also not thrilled by the idea of retreating in front of this French army, which was now very tired after having marched very, very quickly, after having marched very, very quickly over a matter of months. The allied army of Austrian Russia was larger. And it was fresher, and it was better supplied.

There was no strong momentum toward where or when to give the attack against the French. And Napoleon could see that if he wanted a decisive battle, he would have to lure his enemy into a battle. And Napoleon could see that if he wanted a decisive battle, he was going to have to lure his enemy into it. So he used a number of different tricks to convince the Austrians and Russians that he was retreating and wanted no part in a fight with them right now. The first thing he did is, using the core system, he kept a vastly inferior force in the area of his enemies. His men were outnumbered two to one. Now, he had enough men within a day's march that he could almost even the odds when they attacked, but to the Austrians and Russians it looked like they had overwhelming numbers. He sent envoys asking for a temporary armistice and when Russian envoys came to negotiate, he intentionally acted nervous and left out maps showing an imminent retreat. But there was one reason why they thought the French must not want to fight. The French had occupied a very advantageous plateau called the Protsen Heights. This was the perfect position in the area and everyone could see it. It's where you wanted your army to be because up on this plateau you could see all around you, you could set up artillery positions and fire down on your enemies during a battle. And the French abandon the Pratzen Heights and take up a position in the valley below. This is a borderline insane decision. Only someone in an all out retreat would abandon these Pratzen Heights, or so it seemed. In reality, Napoleon was so confident that he was willing to give up the Pratzen Heights just to get his opponents to attack him. üìç The French troops were feeling very confident. They trusted in their commander, and they trusted in themselves. They trusted in their commander, and they trusted in themselves. Napoleon spent the night before walking through the encampments and talking with the men. He was a great leader who was able to inspire. And you see all these great records of this banter that he used to pump up his men. In one encounter, he says, Do you know these people think they are going to swallow us up?

And so as they're sending more and more people to the right flank to attack This meant that the Protsen Heights, the much desired high ground in the middle of the battlefield, was now lightly defended. They didn't worry too much about it, because, as far as they could see, there were no French troops around who were close enough to attack the heights. But that Was where they were wrong. In reality, the low lands where the French army was were not really flat. They were a series of shallow, gentle hills.

The Austrians and Russians couldn't see all of these soldiers right in Napoleon's center because they're, because they're sunk down in a valley and they're just shrouded in frau and they're just shrouded in fog. And just around 11 a. m., and so Napoleon orders these hidden troops to attack the Protsen Heights. And just around 11 a. m., as they start to climb the hill onto the plateau, the sun burns off all the fog and they were revealed to the enemy. Right as it's too late to do anything. The sun The sun of Austerlitz would come to be the enduring symbol of the day's battle. It would symbolize Napoleon's planning, good luck, and preternatural skill.

And now , these soldiers from , and now these other soldiers that Napoleon had sent are up on the Protsen Heights , kind of behind Napoleon: them, and able to fire down on them. Some of the columns that had recently left the Protsen Heights turn around and made a desperate attempt to fight the French, who had just shown up there. The most famous of these counter offensives was made by the Imperial Guard of the Russian army. These were like the Navy SEALs, the SAS, the Special Forces. Of the Russian army, they were especially known among, they were kind of known across Europe for being huge, like physically massive people. They really focused on recruiting tall, broad, strong people, and they were spectacular warriors. They came into, they had earned a reputation as really fearsome, very talented fighters, and so their counter offensive is at first really effective until Napoleon sends in some of his special forces to combat them. And so. And so you have this absolutely spectacular fight, you know, in most battles across all of history. There's not many times when you get two determined forces really just fighting to the death. Most of the time, one side is going to break. It's just really sucks to be shot at, or have a swords, it just really sucks to be shot at, or to have spears thrown at you, or people trying to swing swords at you. And so typically, battles don't last very long, especially with both sides fighting each other. Both of these forces are so well trained, so elite, so prideful, that you have this really fierce fighting over a long period of time. But ultimately, the French were too numerous, too organized, and too disciplined. To be defeated on the pro heights, the Russian special forces are driven off, and then from the commanding pos, the Russian forces are driven off. And then from their commanding position on the heights, they turn the French artillery on the rest of the coalition forces and the battle turns into an all-out route. In one memorable scene, French cannons fired down on Russian and Austrian soldiers as they crossed frozen lakes surrounding the heights breaking the ice and causing the coalition soldiers to drown in the freezing water. Okay, I have to insert this part earlier. Austerlitz would go down in history as Napoleon's greatest battle, and he always considered it such as well. The battle was a symbol both of his genius, and the son of Austerlitz was a symbol of his luck, of his good fortune. Napoleon always encouraged the belief that he was lucky.

As did many other great generals , and Napoleon was actually borrowing this Napoleon: tactic. He said of Caesar, quote, He was right to cite his good fortune and to appear to believe in it. This is a means of acting on the imagination of others without offending anyone's self love. In other words, if you tout your own genius, you might come across as arrogant. You offend others, you make them envious. If, however, you claim to be very lucky. Or blessed by the gods or touched by destiny, then you are implicitly making the claim of greatness, but without all that baggage, men will still want to follow you. Of course, you want to follow someone who just miraculously wins all the time when they're lucky, uh, but you avoid, Yeah, as he said, offending anyone's self love. But I do think Napoleon was also genuinely lucky. There's a quote, I see it attributed to Seneca. I don't know if that's right, but either way, I appreciate the sentiment, which is, and you've probably heard this quote, luck is preparation meeting opportunity. And I do think there is something to that. If I can be so presumptuous to offer myself as an example, I have been really lucky to have this podcast discovered and championed by some people with big platforms. First, Sam Parr, uh, later, Mr. Beast, Cliff Weitzman, Sahil Bloom, Brian Johnson. I didn't do anything to deserve these people. I didn't search them out. I didn't send them my podcast. It was total luck, but I did have the podcast. I had something for them to champion, and so I was able to capitalize on that opportunity. That was, for me, preparation meeting opportunity. On the flip side, since I just gave a good example of myself, I'll give a bad example. I've told this story before on the show, I can't remember which episode, but I remember this incident where I got into an elevator. When I was just a college student and being in an elevator ride with a very famous prominent person who I looked up to. And I realized that I just had nothing to say to him. I had nothing to ask for, nothing to offer, nothing to ask for, nothing to offer. I just wasn't in a place in my life at the time where I could take advantage of that serendipity.

It's also true the saying fortune. It's also true the saying fortune favors the bold. With Napoleon, there is always this constant push, is how I would describe it forward, faster, more. He's always poking, prodding, moving the world. He's always poking, prodding, moving, and because he's always pushing and looking for opportunities to exploit, he is often finding them. And that comes across as luck. Okay, so Austerlitz ends the war of the Third Coalition. The Russians and British don't make peace, but they retreat to their home country. The Russians and British don't make peace, but the Russians retreat to their own home country, cease active hostilities, and the Austrians are completely defeated and have to make peace on French terms. Over the next year, the Holy Roman Empire is abolished, and something called the Confederation of the Rhine takes its place. The Holy Roman Empire was a feature of European international politics for over a thousand years. Voltaire joked that the Holy Roman Empire was neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire, and he was correct. It was founded in the 800s by Charlemagne, and it was a secular political body, so not holy. It was definitively German, and in fact by the time of Napoleon, people casually usually referred to it as the German Empire, so definitely not Roman. And in fact, it wasn't even an empire. It was actually a loose confederation. So, not holy, not Roman, not an empire. Well, what was it? Well, it's hard to define because the empire changed many times over its thousands Well, it's hard to define because the empire had changed many times over its thousand years of existence. In the beginning, it actually was an empire, founded by Charlemagne. But, by the time Napoleon comes around, more than anything, it's a forum for the many tiny German states that existed to work together, to sort out their differences, negotiate, find a way to coexist, and undertake, for the many tiny German states that existed, to work together, sort out their differences, negotiate, and find a way to coexist.

It had come to be seen as something of a relic , as anything that is a thousand years old Napoleon: is in danger of. It was an outdated acronism of the past. And yet, its disillusion also brought about a lot of consternation, a lot of anxiety. from those Germans who had a perhaps irrational but nostalgic attachment to it. One place where it caused a lot of anxiety was the Kingdom of Prussia. You know, it was used to having all of these little weak German states that were a part of the Holy Roman Empire on its borders. And the Confederation of the Rhine, which took its place and was French dominated, extended French influence into Central Europe and put French Prussia's border. Making them deeply uncomfortable that France could potentially start to, that France could potentially start to meddle in their affairs or maybe even invade at some point. So Prussia starts to become belligerent. There were in Prussian society, two factions. One was pro French and the other was anti French, and for a number of reasons, including the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, the anti French faction was beginning to ascend and become more influential. And the Prussians thought that they had a great chance of beating France in a war. They were sort of the original French in that 50 years earlier, Frederick the Great had ruled Prussia as an enlightened despot. In much the same way that Napoleon was doing in France. And the Prussians had been the most professional, innovative, and feared fighting force in Europe in the same way that the French now were. And so, maybe it was a little out of date, but the Prussians still saw themselves this way. As this great fighting force still just waiting to be unleashed. Now, in truth, the French and others had passed the Prussians by. But they didn't know that yet. They hadn't been tested. And it had been a while since they had But they didn't know that yet. It'd been a while since their army had been tested. And so they thought they were still this hyper professional, feared fighting force of 50 years earlier. And so they declare war on France a little more than a year after Austerlitz to start the war of the Fourth Coalition. Prussia was poorly led, poorly trained, disorganized, and feckless from the very beginning of the war of the Fourth Coalition.

He stared at the tomb for a long time in silence. üìç I wonder if maybe Napoleon felt lonely in that moment. Here is the one man in the world who could truly understand him.

Napoleon eventually does attack the Prussians and Russians near modern Kaliningrad. The Russian enclave on the Baltic Sea, and they fight to a standstill at the Battle of Ailau, and then Napoleon scores a crushing victory, and then Napoleon scores a crushing victory at Friedland, which forces the Prussians into submission and forces the Russians to the negotiating table.

But Napoleon had a different idea, and his idea was, I'm actually going to take nothing from Russia, I'm going to prop them up, and I'm going to use them. To divide Europe. So I'm going to say to Russia, okay, you guys can have Eastern Europe. You keep a lid on it and you don't mess with me and we'll work together and I'll take central and Western Europe.

The agreement that they come to is that Russia agrees to join. The continental system, a continental bligate, and so again the agreement they come to is to divide the continent and a key part of this is an agreement that they will enter into a continental blockade against Britain. That neither one of them will allow any British goods in any of their ports and they will completely lock out the British from any European trade. This is 1807, it has been 8 years since Napoleon came to power. He's about to turn 38 years old, and this marked the high water for Napoleon's empire. He controls what is now France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, as well as having satellite states friendly to him that he basically controls in Western Germany, Denmark, and Poland.

At every step of the way, Britain had been able to erode France's overseas colonies because the British navy was so far superior to not only France's navy, but Everyone, almost everyone combined in the world. This was especially true after 1805 and the battle of Trafalgar. If you want to learn more about that, go listen to my Horatio Nelson episodes. At the same time that Nelson was, this was especially true after 1805. Why? Well, because at that time, this is especially true after 1805. At this, this is especially true after 1805. In 1805, at the time that Napoleon was marching around the Austrians to win the Battle of Ulm, the British naval hero, Horatio Nelson, was obliterating the French Navy at the Battle of Trafalgar. This effectively meant the end of the French ability to challenge the British at sea. They had never been able to win at sea, but at least they could stretch the British Navy and make them work for it, essentially. They could blockade every And make them work for it. They didn't have the naval capacity to attack every single, they didn't have the naval capacity to attack every single French colony at the same time. Now they did. They could blockade every French port with near impunity. This cut off important revenues for France and greatly expanded British abilities to make money overseas. The British were blockading nearly all French trade. Napoleon's response was to attempt to turn the tables on them. Napoleon's thought, and I have to admit it seems pretty rational, is, well, if they're going to cut off", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/napoleon", "title": "Napoleon", "chunk_index": 23, "publication_date": "2024-01-16", "total_chunks_in_doc": 41}}

Napoleon ' s thought , and I have to admit it seems pretty rational , is , well , if they ' re going to cut off Napoleon: trade outside of Europe, to me, I'll cut off trade for the British inside of it. And so he developed something called the Continental System, and this is what he was trying to get Russia to adopt. And in it, he tries to get everyone to agree not to trade with the British. European trade is to be totally cut off for them. Of course, Europe was a huge market for them, and the intention was to bring them to their knees economically and force them to make peace. Well, the problem for Napoleon is you have to shut down all of Europe. If there's even one crack, one port where they can smuggle their goods in, then the goods just start pouring into Europe from there. Napoleon is trying to get everyone into the system, but there are cracks from the very beginning. The first place where there are major cracks, and the British are trading extensively, is in Portugal. And all these British goods are coming into Portugal and then through Spain to the rest of Europe. And so it makes Napoleon mad that all of these goods are coming through Spain, who was supposed to be an ally of France's. Spain had been un, Spain had been an unreliable ally of France's for years. The main problem is, they were flat broke. So they couldn't really send any soldiers to help in Napoleon's wars. And so Napoleon decides to do something about this, and he basically takes over Spain. First, he marches across Spain to invade Portugal, and then once his troops are already in, and then once his troops are already there, he forces the abdication of the Spanish king, and puts his brother Joseph on the throne. He doesn't have a very hard time taking Spain, but keeping it is a different matter. You may have heard the term guerrilla warfare, and if you've ever wondered where that came from, it's actually Spanish, guerrilla, and it means little war, and the term originates from this war. Many Spanish are not happy about being invaded, and so they start, and they're not happy about the French, you know, the French are seen as liberal and very atheistic, they're seen as anti Catholic, And Spain had this self image as the most Catholic country in Europe. They were very attached to religion and tradition. So, many Spaniards really hated the French when they invaded. And so, the invasion at first wipes out all their major forces.

They're laying ambushes, taking pot shots from behind trees, intercepting messages, raiding supply lines, so on and so forth. And so they pin down a ton of French forces without allot. And so they pin down French forces and make it really difficult and cause a lot of attrition in this way. They sap French strength considerably over the next few years. The primary feeling you get from Napoleon towards Spain during this time is, I would phrase it as disrespect. The primary feeling you get from Napoleon, at least that I get, when you think about how he interacted with Spain, He's disrespect. He completely disrespected them. He did not take them seriously. The abdication of the Spanish King, it's actually the King and his son, he gets both of them to abdicate. And it's a total sham, a complete farce, very insulting to the Spanish, the way it's carried out. He does it with basically no consideration to how they might feel. He's basically like, I can dictate terms to you. Yeah, it's very obviously me just taking the kingdom from these people, but what are you going to do about it? And this causes just a ton of resentment amongst the Spanish people. His brother Joseph was not a widely respected leader. And while Joseph was a gifted diplomat who had helped his brother in the past, he had shown himself feckless when in independent command. So Napoleon should have known that he was not ready to be the king of Spain. After the initial invasion, Napoleon did not command his forces in person, leaving the war to his subordinates. Which is another way that he shows that this didn't seem important to him or didn't seem serious to him in all matters. Napoleon underestimated the Spanish and to his great detriment, Spain came to be known as the bleeding ulcer. And it wasn't just Spanish guerrillas that he had to worry about. The British sent an army under the command of Sir Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington, to Portugal to assist in the war there. The British army was too small to face the French head on, but they set up a huge defensive fortification around the peninsula that represents the larger Lisbon area. Behind these fortificat behind these fortifications, they could keep the resistance alive, and if the French failed to place sufficient forces there, they could always sally out and perform damaging lightning attacks.

And the Peninsular Napoleon: War, as it would come to be known, because it's the Peninsula, the Iberian Peninsula with Spain and Portugal, would sap resources from the Empire at a time when it could not afford it. The French would suffer over 400, 000 dead, wounded, or captured by the end of this Peninsular War. They would sink millions of dollars worth of gold into the campaign. And it would divert much needed talent and leadership at a time when they were needed elsewhere. Now, part of this was not Napoleon's fault. The alliance, the alliance of England and Portugal was the oldest alliance in the world. It was always likely that the British, it was always likely that the British would leverage them to cause problems for the French. But the Spanish element of this quagmire was unnecessary. I think this is really when you start to see Napoleon's decision making unravel. Perhaps Austerlitz really had gotten to him. He believed himself unbeatable. and wasn't putting the same care into his decisions. He was simply charging forward, trusting that fate would make all his pursuits work out, and trusting that the inertia of the empire was so great now that it couldn't be resisted. And maybe the very size of the empire is the reason that his decision making starts to deteriorate. Maybe the empire was simply too big to govern. If Spain had been the only fire he had to put out, if he'd been able to devote the same attention to it that he had devoted to Italy only a few years previously, maybe he could have dealt with it just as efficiently. So maybe Napoleon is starting to make poor decisions because there's just too much to do, too much to govern, too much even for his incredible mental faculties and this incredible, and this incredible managerial apparatus that he had built around him. There is one other theory for why Napoleon started to lose his touch around 1809 to 1810. There are some people who view Napoleon's wife, Josephine, as his good luck charm. And that relationship was about to end. Josephine might have been a good match for Napoleon when he was an up and coming artillery officer, but she was hardly the kind of match that you would expect for an emperor. And even more importantly, Josephine was by now in her early 40s. They had been married for more than 10 years, and she had never been pregnant during that time. It was clear that she would never produce an heir for him. And this was starting to become really important.

And this was starting to become really important . It Napoleon: was in the front of everyone's minds. If anything happens to Napoleon, who's going to come next? Who's going to inherit this huge empire? And so in 1809, Napoleon set out looking for a new wife. He ended up settling on the young Marie Louise, the eldest child of the Emperor of Austria. The Austrians had been beat up by Napoleon many times. Most recently, in 1809, Austria had tried to take advantage of Napoleon's preoccupation in Spain by declaring war on him again. You get the, you get the idea that these people just cannot learn that they're never gonna beat Napoleon. He beats them every single time. And Napoleon is kind of tired of this, so he imposes a very harsh peace on them, taking away all of their ports and 20 percent of their population. With such punitive measures, there was always the fear that Austria is not going to be content with being relegated to a second rate power, and so they would try and rise up against him in the future. Marrying the emperor's daughter was a good way to keep the Austrians dynastically tied to him. Francis, the emperor of Austria, was a lot more likely to accept his decreased power and the increased power of France if his grandson would one day sit on its throne. The match with Marie The marriage with Marie Louise was also a good match from a personality standpoint. Marie Louise was young, intelligent, and pretty, and though they wouldn't really find this out until after they got married, she got along well with Napoleon. She never captured his passion and enthusiasm the way Josephine had in those early years, but she would be a good and steady companion for him. And so, on January 10th, 1810, Napoleon divorced Josephine, and four months later, he married Marie Louise. Napoleon and Josephine had had a very complicated relationship. It was at first both very passionate and very tumultuous. As time went on, that passion subsided somewhat, though it never completely faded. But what took its place was a partnership. Josephine truly was a master. So the kind of person that knows just what to say to settle someone down or to bring them into a group and make them feel a part of the party.

And this was not the relationship of a taskmaster and his servant. She frequently gave Napoleon advice, offered ideas, acted as a sounding board, and was an important confidant for him. I don't want to exaggerate her role in the recent movie about Napoleon. Um, I don't want to exaggerate her role. She wasn't a government official. She didn't have the level of input of the closest advisors on a day to day basis. And yet she was a very important partner for Napoleon in his governance in. In his governance, in his work, and in his personal life. Oddly, the divorce in some ways strengthened their relationship. Maybe it took off some of the pressure that was felt, uh, in this romantic relationship. Napoleon made sure that she retained some of their royal property and was taken well care of, with a generous government pension, and they continued to speak and write frequently. But of course, you do lose something when someone goes from being a wife to an ex wife. So did Napoleon lose his good luck when he divorced Josephine? Is that the reason that his decision making seemed to deteriorate at the same moment? Well, as romantic and interesting as that notion might be. I don't think it's the case. I think Napoleon's problems came from more boring sources. His continental system, that economic blockade on Britain, was hugely unpopular, impossible to enforce, and driving him broke. Smuggling was widespread, but even so, it was a primary contributor. It was not observed by many, many people. Smuggling was widespread, but even with it not really being enforced, it was still a primary contributor to rebellions that popped up all over the French Empire. People hated it. And the empire was struggling in other ways. It was overextended, over centralized, and difficult to administer. And difficult and expensive to administer.

All of these things would come into play in his downfall. And I think all of them were more important than his relationship with Josephine. You know, despite all of these things working against Napoleon, you can understand his frustration that he must have felt. He had demonstrated time and time again that he was the greatest man of his age. No one could stand up to him in battle. He had won again and again and again. You think about the Austrians. He beat them in Italy, went to Egypt, came back, beat them again in Italy, beats them at Ulm, beats them at Austerlitz, they declare war on him again, he beats them again. It's like, why won't you people get it? And I think that's the way he felt about the entire world. Like, why won't you people get it? I can't be beat. Everywhere he had gone, he had made the, and not just, he couldn't be beat, but why did you want to beat him? Everywhere he had gone, he had made government and administrations more efficient, more rational, more standardized, more modern. In his eyes, he had a destiny. That's something he believed in so strongly. Destiny. He had a destiny as the next great man of Europe. The next Charlemagne. The next Caesar. And he had done so much. to realize that destiny. Why were so many people being so stubborn in refusing to see that? He's thinking, I've beaten Europe's three greatest empires, Austria, Russia, and Prussia, repeatedly. I've beaten them separately. I've beaten them when they combined. And you, Spain? You guys are the ones that think you can do what they couldn't? I have brought every power in Europe to their knees. Britain is surely next, so why can't you all just get on board with me? Why can't you do what I'm asking you to do? He was so close. And then, it seemingly all slipped away at once. In 1811, the Russians began refusing to enforce the continental system. It was hard on all of Europe economically, but it was especially hard on Russia.

And the imposition of the continental system was hugely unpopular in Russia. They also started to get uncomfortable when Napoleon had taken land from Austria that was on their border. They felt like the French were getting awfully close to Russia itself. Emperor Alexander of Russia and Napoleon, you know, had struck up this friendship at Tilsit, and Napoleon believed in the powers of his own charisma. He believed that they were still friends, and that this friendship that this friendship would have a calming, would have a calming effect on any conflict. So even as things are heating up, he thinks, Alexander and I can sort this out. But he was wrong about that. It's difficult to figure out Alexander's psychology. He was an enigmatic man. But for one reason or another, he had turned hard against Napoleon. He had come to loathe him. And he was willing to burn Russia to the ground in order to see Napoleon defeated. But Napoleon didn't know this. He thought that a simple show of force might be enough to bring the conflict to a speedy end, get Alexander back at the negotiating table, re implement the continental system, get everything simpatico. Napoleon's army was huge, one of the largest ever assembled. And it had issues. Napoleon's army was huge. One of the largest ever assembled. So, does Russia really think they can stand up against that? It was an international affair. Not just the French, the Dutch, many German states, Italians, Poles, people from all over the empire were a part of this army. Unfortunately, it had issues right from the very beginning. Russia was a very different place from Germany and Italy, where Napoleon had conducted so many of his campaigns in the past. Those areas had plenty of well-built roads.

They burned any supplies, they looted towns, they made sure that there was nothing for the French to use as they came further and further into Russia. Finally, they gave battle at a town just outside of Moscow called Borodino. It was the most brutal battle of the Napoleonic Wars.

Which were treated in good order. This was actually an error on the part of Napoleon who was uncharacteristically sluggish. He did have some fresh troops who he could have sent after the Russians. Not many, but some. But for once, he overestimated his enemy. He thought the Russians were retreating in better order than they were and could offer some resistance to a pursuit, when in reality they couldn't. And I said Napoleon was uncharacteristically sluggish, but actually, this sluggishness was becoming more and more characteristic all the time. In the past couple of years, he had gone from lean, to portly, to fat. Napoleon was almost never sick, but he had caught a cold before Borodino, which turned into a cough so severe that he was having trouble breathing, and a bladder infection.

After Borodino, the French were able to march into Moscow, which they were shocked to find completely abandoned.

Ultimately he decided to retreat, but too late weeks of wavering had allowed the Russian winter to sneak up on him. üìç The retreat from Moscow reads like a horror movie. The weather was freezing. The men had no food, and for the entire retreat, they were hunted by Russian cossacks who would raid the French columns If a horse fell, men seized upon it and began carving it up for meat before it was even dead every morning. Hundreds of men simply didn't wake up, frozen to death by the cold of the night. The Russians who followed them found encampments that looked like battlefields. Here's how one described it. if a horse fell. Men seized upon it and began carving it. The French army's every bivouac and encampment was like the terrifying sight of the battlefield, where thousands lay dying in great agony. And so the warriors who perhaps survived Austerlitz, Eylau, and Borodino now easily fell into our hands. They were in a state of trance, so that every Cossack captured and brought back dozens of them. They could not comprehend what was happening around them, could not remember or understand anything.

France would give up Italy, Germany, Poland, and Spain. But Napoleon would stay Emperor of France, and France would still maintain enlarged borders that included Belgium and the Rhineland. But Napoleon, still believing he could win, rejected this offer. In retrospect, it was a huge missed opportunity. After the situation grew more desperate, peace was once again offered to him, this time along what was called France's natural borders. This is more or less what corresponds to the borders of the France that we know today. But Napoleon could not accept this. By this point he knew he was going to lose, but he believed, or at least he said he believed, that the French people would not allow him to stay on the throne in such a diminished state. Glory was the entire justification for his rule. If he could not give France victory and glory, then what was the point of all of this? The funny thing is that, through all of this, Napoleon continued to win battle after battle. It was just that he was so outnumbered that it didn't matter. His chief rival, the British general Arthur Wellesley, also known as the Duke of Wellington, said of this time period, quote, The 1814 campaign has given me a greater idea of his genius than any other. Had he continued that system a little longer, it is my opinion that he would have saved Paris. Napoleon was always better with a small, fast, highly mobile army. But, but he can't keep it up. There are just too many enemies. You know, he'll win one battle, and as he's winning it, another army is going around him and marching towards Paris, so he has to race to so he has to race to catch, to catch them, and then he beats them, and then another army is marching on Paris. They go around him, and eventually lay siege to Paris, at which point, the French force him to abdicate.

And, Napoleon is personally upset at some of the actions that they have taken, specifically against his family. The Bonaparte family estates are seized, which Napoleon is very offended by. I guess he thought the new French government would allow his family to keep their property and fortunes, which he considered acquired very legitimately in service to the French nation.

On British forces, uh, combined with Prussian forces who are in the area and they meet at the notorious and famous, and they meet in modern day Belgium, uh, at the notorious and famous battle of Waterloo, as you probably know, if you know anything about history, Napoleon loses at Waterloo, he's crushed. And what's most surprising is that he displays none of the characteristic trademarks of Napoleonic leadership. He's lethargic, his tactics are straightforward and unoriginal, his battle plan is basically. Charged straight at them. He divides his forces rather than concentrating them the night before the battle, something he never did. And something that flies in the face of his core strategy is difficult to say why exactly. And this follows a trend that had been going on for years now of deteriorating leadership and decision making. And once again, people speculate on why exactly it was that his decision making crumbled so much. And there are all these theories, you know, his physical health was failing, uh, he had hemorrhoids, which made it difficult for him to stay on horseback and scout the ground. He hadn't had a solid night's sleep in about six days. He may have had the flu. Some say he was just getting old. No one really knows.

But you know, all these theories, I think the best thing to do is take Napoleon at his own word. He said, quote, I sensed that fortune was abandoning me. I no longer had in me the feeling of ultimate success. And if one is not prepared to take risks when the time is ripe, one ends up doing nothing. So, he's beaten. And this time the British exile him to the island of St. Helena, which has been described as further from anywhere than anywhere else in the world. It's in the middle of the Atlantic, uh, between Africa and South America, and it really is incredibly remote. There would be no chance of escape now. üìç On St. Helena, he writes some.

His last fevered, barely coherent words were, France. The army. The head of the army. Josephine. And there, our story ends. So what are some of the lessons that we can learn from Napoleon? From his downfall, I think we can learn that it is important to stand for something. The biographer, Michael Broers says that the biographer, Michael Broers says that quote ambition ruled Napoleon, a contemporary said of him, quote, unless Napoleon's ambition to which every other consideration was sacrificed, interfered, he was possessed of much sensibility and feeling, and was capable of strong attachment. In other words, he could be a really good friend unless it got in the way of his ambition and all other considerations were sacrificed to that ambition. I think that's such a strong and powerful statement about who Napoleon was, every other consideration was sacrificed to his ambition. Napoleon was a complicated man with many competing ideas and impulses. A lot of people want to distill him down to just one thing, but he wasn't, he was complicated and he was very human. But I do think it's true what Michael Brewer said. Ultimately, all of those other impulses were repressed if they came into conflict with", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/napoleon", "title": "Napoleon", "chunk_index": 36, "publication_date": "2024-01-16", "total_chunks_in_doc": 41}}
{"text": "him down to just one thing , but he wasn ' t , he was complicated and he was very human . But I do think it ' s true what Michael Brewer said . Ultimately , all of those other impulses were repressed if they came into conflict with Napoleon: his ambition. Napoleon truly was a liberal minded person. Napoleon truly was a liberal minded person who believed in the high minded ideals of the Enlightenment. He implemented many liberal minded reforms, but he freely disposed of those ideas. If they came into conflict with that ambition, I don't think he saw, I don't think he saw it quite so cynically Napoleon was pragmatic. He wanted things to work and I think he rationalized it as well. The best way for things to work is for me to be in charge, but ultimately, I mean, come on, there is some element of rationalization in that I don't think there is some element of rationalization in that. He was just ambitious. I don't think people fully grasp the extent to which he was trying to um, I don't think people fully grasp the extent to which he was trying to emulate and ultimately out compete Julius Caesar. You know, all these greats from the past, but especially Julius Caesar. I'm gonna describe someone to you, okay? Just listen to the description of this man. He made his name as a young general with military victories in France. He then invaded Italy. He became consul, and later became emperor. He was the ruler of a republican government, and many people were uncomfortable with his monarchical tendencies. He invaded Egypt, and excited the public imagination with his tales of this exotic and faraway land. He was not only a great general, but a great writer who was a He was not only a great general, but a great writer who was able to excite the public imagination with his missives. Everything I just said, this description, could perfectly describe Napoleon, of course, or Julius Caesar. I mean, their lives are eerily similar. Napoleon was obsessed with Plutarch's lives. And that's this book of all of these classical biographies. You know, You know, short, short, basically episodes of How to Take Over the World. Short, short biographies of, short biographies on great Greeks and Romans in the past, uh, with lessons to learn from their lives. And if you want to learn more about Plutarch's lives, Go and listen to the excellent podcast, The Cost of Glory, by my friend Alex Petkus. That is what he does, and he does an excellent job.

{"text": "Alex Petkus . That is what he does , and he does an excellent job . But this competition with the ancients is part of what fueled his personal ambition . If he had been better able to articulate what he believed in , if he had seemed more like Napoleon: the leader of a movement, if he had seemed more liberal, frankly, I think he would not have had so many problems with resistance to his rule. But the fact that it seemed not like a movement, not something you could get behind and believe in, but the pragmatic rule of one man, Made it easy to be jealous of him, made it easy to be resentful, made it easy to be resentful of all this power that he had acquired. Another lesson that we can learn from his fall is something that we read in Machiavelli's The Prince, who wrote, People should either be caressed or crushed. If you do them minor damage, they will get their revenge. But if you cripple them, there is nothing they can do. If you need to injure someone, do it in such a way that you do not have to fear their vengeance. Napoleon had to return to fight the same enemies over and over and over again. He ought to have eliminated the Austrian and Prussian monarchies entirely. He could have broken them up and ruled over smaller states, as he did so successfully in the Confederation of the Rhine. Though, of course, those were states that were amalgamated, not broken down. But in any case, Napoleon too frequently grievously injured his opponents without truly crippling them. Even though he had the opportunity to do so. And so I do think that's a lesson. That if you have to offend someone, if you have to beat them, if you have to injure them, do it in such a way that they can never strike back at you. Otherwise, leave them alone and be careful not to offend. Okay, well what are some of the more positive lessons that we can learn from Napoleon? We can learn from his boundless energy. And the question arises, where does that energy come from? I think on a certain level, it comes from doing what you love. Remember, he was depressed. We can learn from his boundless energy. And where does that energy come from? I think on a certain level, it comes from doing what you love. Remember, he was depressed when he was taken away from active duty. He loved leading men into battle that gave him energy.

But I think it was also a biological phenomenon. He was an extremely energetic person. And once his body started to fail him, there went his energy. Once he got fat and sick, he was no longer the same energetic, decisive commander. So I think it's important to get your body right if you want to be an energetic leader. I think partially, it is just a biological phenomenon. I think we can learn from Napoleon's impatience. Even when ahead of schedule, he wanted things done faster. I think we can learn from his luck. That good luck came from his aggression. Fortune favors the bold. But most of all, I think Napoleon lived a beautiful life. He was at heart an artist, a painter. The fields of Marengo and Jena and Rivoli and Austerlitz were his canvases. Human blood was his paint. And the cost of his art was terrible, and you might not consider it worth it, and maybe it wasn't. But it was beautiful in its way. Alright, that's it.

He came from an upper middle class family. His father was a newspaper man who ran the Oregon journal. Phil discovered running early on and discovered that he was quite a good runner. So he attended the university of Oregon, where he ran for the legendary coach, Bill Bowerman. He majored in journalism and wrote for the school newspaper following in his father's footsteps. But, he didn't want to be a full time journalist and newspaper man. Phil Knight respected his father and had a good relationship with him. But he resented his father's obsession with respectability. His dad had come from a poorer family, and so his major preoccupation in life was respectability. Appearing proper, like he had things together to his neighbors. Well, Phil had a slightly more chaotic personality than that. And besides, he graduated in 1959, so we're right on the cusp. of the 1960s and that feeling of rebelliousness was already starting to rise in his generation. And even for his generation, I think Phil was a seeking personality. He loved to read, especially history, and he had this thirst to see and experience the world. So Phil joined the army for a year and then went to Stanford Graduate School of Business where he got his MBA. And these were steps that helped him delay his future until he could figure things out what he really wanted. But even when he graduates from Stanford, he feels that something is still missing. Here's what he says about it. Quote, On paper, I thought, I'm an adult. Graduated from a good college, University of Oregon.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/nike-founder-phil-knight", "title": "Nike founder Phil Knight", "chunk_index": 1, "publication_date": "2024-08-06", "total_chunks_in_doc": 30}}
{"text": ". But even when he graduates from Stanford , he feels that something is still missing . Here ' s what he says about it . Quote , On paper , I thought , I ' m an adult . Graduated from a good college , University of Oregon . Nike founder Phil Knight: Earned a master's from a top business school, Stanford. Survived a year long hitch in the U. S. Army, Fort Lewis and Fort Eustis. My resume said I was a learned, accomplished soldier, a 24 year old man in full. So why, I wondered, why do I still feel like a kid? Maybe because I still hadn't experienced anything of life, least of all its many temptations and excitements. I hadn't smoked a cigarette, hadn't tried a drug, I hadn't broken a rule, let alone a law. The 1960s were just underway, the age of rebellion. And I was the only person in America who hadn't yet rebelled. I couldn't think of one time I'd cut loose, done the unexpected. I was searching for something else, something more. I had an aching sense that our time is short, shorter than we ever know. Short as a morning run. And I wanted mine to be meaningful, and purposeful, and creative, and important. Above all, different. So he does some soul searching. So he does some soul searching about what he really wants in life. And he has an epiphany as he's running one day. Here's what he says. And then it happened. As my young heart began to pump. As my peak And then it happened, as my young heart began to thump, as my pink lungs expanded like the wings of a bird, as the trees turned to greenish blurs, I saw it all before me, exactly what I wanted my life to be. Play. Yes, I thought, that's it, that's the word, the secret of happiness I'd always suspected, the essence of beauty or truth, or all we ever need to know of either, lay somewhere in that moment when the ball is in midair, when both boxers sense the approach of the bell, when the runner's near the finish line and the crowd rises as one. Play. There's a kind of exuberant clarity in that pulsing half second before winning and losing are decided. I wanted that, whatever that was, to be my life, my daily life. Now he realizes that's Now, he realizes that that sort of competition isn't going to come from athletics. He had worked his guts out at Oregon, and he had come to the realization that he was a good runner, not a great one. So, if not athletics,", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/nike-founder-phil-knight", "title": "Nike founder Phil Knight", "chunk_index": 2, "publication_date": "2024-08-06", "total_chunks_in_doc": 30}}
{"text": "he realizes that that sort of competition isn ' t going to come from athletics . He had worked his guts out at Oregon , and he had come to the realization that he was a good runner , not a great one . So , if not athletics , Nike founder Phil Knight: then what? Okay, here's another quote. The world was so overrun with war and pain and misery, the daily grind was so exhausting and often unjust. Maybe the only answer, I thought, was to find some prodigious, improbable dream that seemed worthy, that seemed fun, that seemed a good fit, and chase it with an athlete's single minded dedication and purpose. Like it or not, life is a game. Whoever denies that truth, whoever simply refuses to play, gets left on the sidelines. And I didn't want that. More than anything, that was the thing. I did not want. Okay. So what does that mean in practice? Well, at Stanford business school, he had written a paper on the possibility of bringing Japanese running shoes to the U S market. Japan was a burgeoning manufacturing hub. They were the China of their day and no one else was really doing this. And so, you know, it's an odd mismatch the way he talks about a prodigious, improbable dream on the one hand, and the relatively simple goal of bringing Japanese manufacturing to the American shoes and the relatively simple goal of bringing Japanese manufacturing. To American shoes on the other hand, right? That doesn't seem like a prodigious dream, at least in my mind. But one, it would involve him in the world of athletics and sports, which he loved, and it would also give him a chance to travel internationally. The 1960s were not like today. People didn't travel nearly as much and international business was a difficult in person job. You know, today you can get something manufactured halfway around the world and never visit, just do communication online. But obviously that's not the case in 1962, but I also think doing anything with a lot of potential is always exciting. And he sees potential. And then I think this is a very interesting part of the story. So he's out for a morning run when he has this epiphany that importing Japanese shoes is his crazy idea. That's what he calls it. He says, it seems so obvious, so simple, and so potentially huge. And I liked the way he describes this feeling of epiphany. He says, quote, I was suddenly smiling, almost laughing, drenched in sweat, moving as gracefully and effortlessly as I ever had. I saw my crazy idea shining up ahead and it didn't look all And it didn't look all that crazy. It didn't even", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/nike-founder-phil-knight", "title": "Nike founder Phil Knight", "chunk_index": 3, "publication_date": "2024-08-06", "total_chunks_in_doc": 30}}

I saw my crazy idea shining up ahead and it didn ' t look all And it didn ' t look all that crazy . It didn ' t even Nike founder Phil Knight: look like an idea. It looked like a place. It looked like a person, or some life force that existed long before I did. Separate from me, but also part of me. Waiting for me, but also hiding from me. That might sound a little high flown, a little crazy. But that's how I felt back then. And by the way, this idea of your future as something that's already real, something tangible waiting for you. I think this is another theme of great leaders and achievers. Listen to this quote from Novak Djokovic. He said this just a couple of days ago after winning the gold medal in men's tennis at the Olympics. He said, I would just like to send a message to every young person out there, whatever you're pursuing in the world, whether it's tennis, sports, or anything else. You know, I was a seven year old dreaming that I could win, you know, I was a seven year old dreaming that I could win Wimbledon and become number one in the world one day. One thing is for sure. I feel that I had the power to create my own destiny. I tried to visualize every single thing in my life, not only believe it, but really feel it with every cell in my body. If you want a better future, you create it. And this is something that I've touched on in the last few episodes, is this idea of belief. I talked about it with Michael Jordan, that his self belief allowed him to excel under pressure, because his self worth wasn't riding on these clutch shots. He already believed he was the man, this was just a chance to prove it. And so I think, you know, You have a somewhat similar phenomenon with Phil Knight here. He had such a strong belief in this dream It was something tangible, something that already existed, though only in his mind for the moment, that it would allow him to persevere through moments of extreme difficulty and pressure, because after all, why not? The dream is already real. You just have to get there. So I think that this immense belief is a superpower. If you really believe in what you're doing, if you can visualize it, Like Phil Knight did. And if you view it as real to you, you're just pulling it into the world, that's extremely powerful. So Phil has this idea about Japanese running shoes. And what he wants to", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/nike-founder-phil-knight", "title": "Nike founder Phil Knight", "chunk_index": 4, "publication_date": "2024-08-06", "total_chunks_in_doc": 30}}

So Phil has this idea about Japanese running shoes . And what he wants to Nike founder Phil Knight: do is go on an around the world trip and see everything that the world has to offer, and then as part of the trip, stop in Japan and talk with some of the shoe manufacturers about becoming their distributor in the United States. And so he asks his dad for a little cash to help with the trip and for his blessing. And even though his father was obsessed with respectability, Phil senses that there was some part of him that wished he could have seen the world when he was younger. He always had an adventurous side that he mostly suppressed. So he's right about this. His father gives his blessing and some money, and he also convinces his friend Carter to go with him. They leave from San Francisco and their first stop is in Hawaii. And they stop in Hawaii and they're like, we're not going anywhere else. I mean, you just have to imagine what a paradise Hawaii was back then. I mean, it's still a paradise. Why is unbelievable. Gorgeous Island, perfect weather, beautiful, warm beaches. And back then it didn't have the traffic and crowding issues that it has now. And so Phil and Carter decide to ditch the rest of the trip and make a home in Hawaii. How could life get any better? So they get jobs selling encyclopedias door to door and Phil hates it. He's bad at it. He doesn't like pressuring people to pay for something that he doesn't really believe in. And then he gets another job selling investments with a company called investors overseas services. And he actually excels at that because they have good products that he actually believes in. He's not a great talker, but he really knows his stuff and he really believes in it. So he's quite successful at iOS. So he's quite successful at this company. iOS is what it's called. It's not a vocation. He's not in love with the job. He's doing it just to be able to make enough money to stay in Hawaii and go surfing every day. And after a few months, he gets the itch to keep moving, keep seeing the world. So he quits his job and keeps going. His friend Carter decides to stay in Hawaii. And Phil now is going to be traveling the world alone. So he does, he leaves from Hawaii. His first stop is Japan. And of course, this is not just a sightseeing trip.

It is that he goes Nike founder Phil Knight: and he sees, um, you know, some of the great temples he sees Tokyo, but the primary purpose of this stop of the trip. So he meets up with some connections that his father had, and they refer him to some importers who in turn refer him to a company called Onitsuka in Kobe. Uh, the company is now known as Asics. So he meets with Mr. Onitsuka, the owner of the company, and a few higher ups, a few executives. And Phil is nervous. I mean, can you imagine how nervous he would be? Onitsuka was a very big company. These were their top executives and he was really kind of bluffing, right? And he was just a kid with an idea and he's hoping that they'll take him seriously, even though they really have no reason to, and this is his moment. And this is his chance to make his dream reality. And you can just imagine you're just, you're a kid who's been selling encyclopedias in Hawaii for months. And you've got these real professional executives looking at you. I mean, just imagine what that would feel like. And then the first question, the first thing they ask before you can even get started is a total gut punch. They ask, what company are you with? Japan was a very hierarchical society. It's a place where size and prestige matter a lot. And he's got nothing, right? There is no company. So he stalls. He pauses. Ah, yes. Good question. His life flashes before his eyes. He takes a couple breaths. His adrenaline surges. And in that moment, he thinks back to his room in his parents house with all his trophies and blue ribbons. In the U. S., blue ribbons are given for first place finishes. I think that's true everywhere. I'm not sure. So he's thinking of that room and his trophies and blue ribbons. And he blurts out blue ribbon and composes himself a little bit and says, gentlemen, I represent blue ribbon sports in Portland, Oregon. And the men murmur their approval. Ah, yes. Blue ribbon, very distinguished sounding. And he then pitches them his idea of importing and distributing their line of shoes called tiger shoes. Now he's able to sound prepared and well thought out.

They, they have believed him about this blue ribbon sports. And I think, Oh, there's blue ribbon sports. We need to work with them. And so now they're, Trying to make sure that he's interested in distributing their shoes. And they finished by asking, would blue ribbon be interested in representing Tiger shoes in the United States? Yes. He answers blue ribbon would be very interested. They give him a model of a new shoe they're developing. And he says, this is a good shoe. I can sell this shoe. And he asks them to ship him samples right away. And he promises to send a money order for 50. And he goes to the nearest American express office and sends a letter to his dad, dear dad, urgent, please wire 50 right away to Onitsuka Corp of Kobe. And with that, the first and most important part of his grand around the world journey is finished. So he doesn't go straight home. He continues on his journey. He goes to India and sees the Himalayas and the Ganges. He goes to Egypt and sees the pyramids. He goes to Rome, where he takes in the Colosseum and hears a performance of Nessun Dorma, which is my favorite piece of opera music. Not that it's much of a competition, not like a big opera head here, but um, it's one of the few pieces of opera music that I know and love. It's incredible.

Greece . üìç When he had left Oregon , he was most excited about two things on his itinerary . First was pitching his crazy idea in Japan . And Nike founder Phil Knight: the second was seeing the Acropolis in Athens. If you've never seen the Acropolis, it is perhaps the most magnificent thing in this world. I say that without hyperbole. I just saw it for the first time last week, actually. And it's just unbelievable. It's this magnificent outcropping of rocks in the middle of Athens that just jut into the sky and overwhelms you. The physical, the physical geographic feature would be enough to take your breath away. And then you see how man has been able to tame and even beautify it further. You see these stone supports at the top that support this temple complex on top of this outcropping of rocks. And then you climb the hill, and as you do, uh, you enter these gates, and it's like you're entering a new world. Most, once you're there, on top of the Acropolis, most people are drawn to the largest and most famous temple, the Parthenon, which is beautiful. But Phil was üìç instinctively drawn to the smaller temple that precedes it, a temple dedicated to victory. The temple, the Parthenon. Nike. Here's what he said about that moment. Hours before boarding my flight at Heathrow. I meditated on that moment, looking up at those astonishing columns, experiencing that bracing shock, the kind you received from all great beauty, but mixed with a powerful sense of recognition. Was it only my imagination after all? I was standing at the birthplace of Western civilization? Maybe I merely wanted it to be familiar, but I didn't think so. I had the clearest thought, I've been here before. Then, walking up those bleached steps, another thought. This is where it all begins. On my left was the Parthenon, which Plato had watched the teams of architects and workmen build. On my right was the temple of Athena Nike. 25 centuries ago, per my guidebook, it had housed a beautiful frieze of the goddess Athena, thought to be the bringer of Nike, or victory. I don't know how long I stood there, absorbing the energy and power of that epical place. An hour? Three? Three? Three? I don't know how long after that day I discovered that Aristophanes I don't know how long after that day I discovered that Aristophanes play, set in the Temple of Nike, in which the warrior gives the gift a in which the warrior gives the king a gift.

A pair of new shoes . I don ' t know Nike founder Phil Knight: when I figured out that the play was called Knights. I do know that as I turned to leave I noticed the temple's marble facade. Greek artisans had decorated it with several haunting carvings. including the most famous, in which the goddess inexplicably leans down to adjust the strap on her shoe. By the way, Nessun Dorma means let no one sleep. It's sung by a prince, Caliph, It's sung by a prince, Caliph, who falls in love at first sight with the beautiful princess Turundot. Caliph is singing his assurance that he will find a way to win her love and her hand. The song ends, Al alba, vincero, vincero, vincero. At dawn, the sun rises. I will win. I will win. I will win. Will Phil come ho Ahem. Will Phil comes home to Oregon after this amazing life changing adventure. His family is hugging him and so excited to see him, but he can't wait. As his dad is hugging him, he asks, Dad, The answer, distressingly, was no. He sends a follow up letter asking where his shoes are. The response comes back from Onitsuka, Shoes coming in just little more days. Well, eventually the shoes do come, of course. Twelve pairs of beautiful tiger shoes. Phil sends the first two pairs to his old coach, Bill Bowerman. Bowerman was obsessed with shoes. He was always modifying his runner's shoes and messing around with them. Most of all, he liked to strip things out, uh, making them lighter. He did the math and was fond of saying that a couple extra ounces, he did the math and was fond of saying that a couple extra ounces added up to more than 50 pounds of weight over the course of all the strides taken during a mile long race. So Bill Bowerman is obsessed with his runner's shoes and he likes the shoes. And actually he even eventually asks Knight. If they could partner and they agree that Phil Knight should be the one who's ultimately in control of the company. So they agree on a 51 49 split. This is not a job. There's not even a startup at this point. It's basically just the hope of a dream. They've got this agreement with Onitsuka and that's it.

But the work is boring, and most excruciatingly, it takes him away from his beloved tiger shoes. As an aside, he writes of a dream of a letter to his old friend who he had left in Hawaii. Dear Carter, did you ever leave Shangri La? I'm an accountant now, and giving some thought to blowing my brains out. But more than anything, working for a big accounting firm, yes it's boring, but it gives them a great education. He has the opportunity to see a lot of businesses, how they work financially, what makes them tick, what makes them succeed, what makes them fail, and he actually works as an accountant for years, for a long time. You know, focus is one of those things that is a key to making any endeavor succeed. So I think some people think that they need to be able to devote all of their focus to something right away. But there are a lot of advantages to hedging your bets and not putting the pressure on your baby, you know, this new startup, this new thing you're excited about to pay for your life right away. You need to give it some time to grow at its own pace, which is exactly what Phil Knight does. So he's working, so he's working as an accountant by day, and he's selling tiger shoes in the evenings and weekends. And he quickly starts selling more and more tigers. He takes a thousand dollar loan from his father to buy his first inventory. And he's rejected by retailers, so he sells the shoes out of the back of his car at track meets. And he's amazing at selling shoes. In Shoe Dog, Phil Knight wonders why he was so good at selling shoes out of the back of his car when he'd been so bad at selling encyclopedias. And the answer, he says, is, quote, Belief. Belief is irresistible. I think that's a really good way of thinking of it. Belief is irresistible. He also gets a decent mail order business going, not on purpose, but because people hear about him selling tigers and send him requests. Word starts spreading like wildfire.

He decided things are going so well, uh, that after a year, he decides to hire a salesman in California to expand. He ends up hiring a guy named Jeff Johnson, but he has this question of how to get down to California. He's got a decent job and he's living with his parents, but he's still spending everything he has on the business. And like most great founders, he's incredibly frugal. So he doesn't want to pay for the airfare. And what he ends up doing is going to the army base in his uniform and acting like he belongs. He just boards a military transport bound for a base in California. So he's taking free flights on a military transport back and forth from California. This is back when people were free and not everything was a bureaucratic nightmare, or at least, I mean, I guess it probably was, but at least the bureaucracies were inept enough that they could be manipulated. So things are growing great. So anyway, things go on like this for a few years. Things are going great. He's on a roll. Um, Things are going great. He's on a roll. Nike is, things are going great. He's on a roll. Blue Ribbon Sports is growing. And then one day he gets a letter from a high school wrestling coach. And this coach claimed he had just returned from Japan, where the Onitsuka Corporation had just given him exclusive distribution rights for their running shoes. Orders Phil Knight to stop selling shoes and he orders, orders Phil Knight to stop selling tiger shoes. So Phil is of course, very disturbed to hear this. And when he writes to Japan, he finds them very evasive and non responsive. And so he can feel his business being pulled out from under his feet at the very moment. So he goes to Japan and he forces a confrontation with Onitsuka. When he arrives at their headquarters, he can tell that they are uncomfortable. This was not an oversight or an accident. These were people who wanted him out. Once again, he's under pressure to deliver. And once again, he does. It turns out that the exclusive, It turns out that the executive he had negotiated the deal with was no longer with Onitsuka and his replacement had hired this, and his replacement is the one who had gone and talked to the wrestling coach on the East coast.

But Phil is able to directly pitch the owner and executive of the company, Mr. Onitsuka, who feels a personal connection with him and allows Phil Knight to continue as the exclusive distributor of Tiger shoes in the Western United States. So he comes back to the U S and sales are better than ever. He is however, having trouble with his bank. So in their early days, Nike was always having trouble with their banks. The problem was the more they grew, the larger their purchase orders became and financing constantly became a problem. And these banks were making loans on debt. They didn't have any equity in blue ribbon sports. Venture capital wasn't a thing yet. And so, you know, you would think if you're a bank, You're looking at blue ribbon and their sales are growing every year. So that's a good thing, right? But no, the company is, but no, for these banks, blue ribbons, rapidly increasing sales were actually concerning. Uh, it was totally backwards. They tell him that he should slow down sales because his growth rate was too fast. For his equity. So anyway, he says in response, no, you grow or you die. Life is all about growth. I have to grow. He has this just like insatiable desire to grow, not necessarily because it made business sense. Although he may have believed that, but because he wanted everyone to have these tiger shoes, like what stopped growing. That means stop evangelizing, stop getting more of these shoes in on more. Uh, in Uh, of runners. Uh, he just couldn't imagine it. So anyways, they have to switch banks a couple of times. At one point he finds out later that one bank only accepts him because one of their senior executives really believed in him and personally guaranteed the loan. In other words, the bank says no, but he says, look, I'll guarantee, uh, this company, if they fail, you know, I'll be on the hook. So for now, this is sort of a, a minor to medium sized headache, but it will become a major problem as time goes on. They're doing things. That don't scale in order to succeed. So for example, one customer complains that he doesn't think the Tigers would last the 26 miles of a marathon. He thinks they're,", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/nike-founder-phil-knight", "title": "Nike founder Phil Knight", "chunk_index": 12, "publication_date": "2024-08-06", "total_chunks_in_doc": 30}}

So for example , one customer complains that he doesn ' t think the Tigers would last the 26 miles of a marathon . He thinks they ' re , Nike founder Phil Knight: they're too thin. And so Jeff Johnson hires a local cobbler to graft rubber soles from a pair of shower shoes into the Tiger shoes. So, so, and like, they're doing all sorts of stuff like this, all sorts of experiments, all sorts of modifications, you know, handwritten letters to customers who buy a pair of shoes. They're just, you know, elbow grease, hand to hand combat. Um, you know, they're just elbow grease, hand to hand combat, you know, selling shoes one by one. You know, the thing that's interesting to me about this time period is, I had always taken for granted that you need to start off with a vision, right? An end point. But that is not what Nike was like. And by the way, if you like learning about Phil Knight, let me recommend episode one 86 of the founders podcast. That is an episode about Phil Knight. Founders is like how to take over the world, but specifically for and about founders of great companies. It's hosted by my friend David, and I think he is genuinely one of the best in the business. It's one of the few podcasts that I listened to and get jealous of. If you're a founder, if you aspire to be a founder, you have to listen to founders. He's able to get so many actionable insights from these stories. It never ceases to inspire and motivate me. So if you love this show, I'm sure you'll love that show. So check out founders wherever you get your podcasts. So, this first employee, Jeff Johnson, he's not making very much money. He's really only doing this because he loves running, he loves the shoes, he loves what they're doing. And so he asks Phil, where is this going? And here's what Phil Knight writes about his response, quote, I didn't lie, exactly. Maybe out of pity, maybe haunted by the image of Johnson, single, lonely, his body wrapped in plaster. Gamely trying to keep himself and my company alive, I sounded an upbeat tone. Blue Ribbon, I said, would probably morph over the years into a generalized sporting goods company. We'd probably have offices on the West Coast, and one day, maybe, in Japan. Far fetched, I wrote, but it seems worth shooting for. Okay, so, he", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/nike-founder-phil-knight", "title": "Nike founder Phil Knight", "chunk_index": 13, "publication_date": "2024-08-06", "total_chunks_in_doc": 30}}

Far fetched , I wrote , but it seems worth shooting for . Okay , so , he Nike founder Phil Knight: doesn't really have the long term vision worked out yet. Obviously, the company does have a short term vision, , but you don't have to have a long term vision figured out from the very beginning. In fact, when Phil Knight thinks about the long term, he has no idea what is going to happen. In fact, he's quite pessimistic. Blue Ribbon is always so close to being dropped from their bank or dropped by Onitsuka that he assumes that it's only a matter of time before the whole venture fails. But, he writes, quote, My hope was that when I failed, if I failed, I'd fail quickly. So I'd have enough time, enough years, to implement all the hard won lessons. I wasn't much for setting goals, but this goal kept flashing through my mind every day until it became my internal I wasn't much for setting goals, but this goal kept flashing through my mind every day until it became my internal chant. Fail fast. Well eventually Blue Ribbon wins the contract to expand beyond the West Coast and they take over distribution for Tiger Shoes all over the United States. And by the way, I say distribution, but at this point they are sending designs to Onitsuka, and those shoes designed by Blue Ribbon are very successful. Despite all this, Phil Knight is still, still an accountant by day. He's now working for Price Waterhouse, a big accounting firm. He's now on his fifth year of running Blue Ribbon, but he just can't see how he can afford to pay himself a salary. And so what he does instead is take a job as a part time professor. at Portland State University. It pays far less than his accounting job, but it was also fewer hours, and it allows him to dedicate more time to Blue Ribbon. Another thing I found interesting is that Blue Ribbon, which obviously becomes Nike, is a great story of compounding times time. So we're in five years. So we're five years in. And Blue Ribbon has doubled their sales every year. So year one was about 8, 000 in sales. And now they're at about 150, 000 in sales. And they do have a few breakthroughs, but nothing too far outside of that trend. This is just a company that doubles every year for a couple of decades.

And that ' s interesting to me because , and that ' s very interesting to me , but this is just Nike founder Phil Knight: a company that their, their growth rate doesn't get too out of whack. They just double every year for decades. And it's interesting to me. And I'll get a little personal here because I'm someone who is always looking for that home run, right? What can I do that will 10 X how to take over the world? But reading this helped caution me towards patients. I've been doubling every year for five years and maybe I just need to be like Phil Knight and focus on the fundamentals because compound growth is very powerful. Think of what this podcast will be if I can double it every year for five more years. So the lesson there is as long as your fundamentals are good and you're growing. Be patient and let compound growth do its thing. Okay. So after five years, blue ribbon has three employees, two of whom Phil Knight later finds out are not cashing their checks. They really love blue ribbon and they could tell that it's financially precarious, so they want to do whatever they can to help it succeed. And over the next few years, they hire aggressively, mostly in sales to help them move more shoes. They have 40, they have 40 employees by 1970. So they're growing quickly. They're taking on employees in 1970 and it's in this same year. That Phil Knight gets a call from a shoe distributor on the East coast. And he's confused because they were distributing shoes from blue ribbon, but Onitsuka corporation had asked them if they would be interested in becoming their new us distributor. So this guy isn't even trying to help out blue ribbon. He's not trying to threaten them either. He's just legitimately confused. Like, wait a minute. I thought you guys were the us distributors for Onitsuka. Am I wrong about that? So Phil is like, no, you're right about that. Thank you. And so he forces a showdown with Onitsuka. He tells them, Hey guys, you need to give us some clarity here. So they send out a representative to talk and they, and that representative expresses his disappointment. He says, look, and that representative expresses his disappointment. He says, you should be doing better. And Phil Knight says, look, we've been doubling your sales in the U S every year.

Some say that you should be tripling it Nike founder Phil Knight: or more. So it's a civil, but tense negotiation. And then. Disrepresentative from Onitsuka excuses himself to go to the restroom. And when he does, Phil Knight starts rifling through his briefcase and steals the papers that he had in there. The ones that seem relevant. He copies the papers. And the next day he uses some cloak and dagger, you know, spy stuff to slide the papers back into the guy's briefcase. This is great stuff. You know, Phil Knight is willing to do. Whatever it takes to survive and to win, including stealing documents. So, uh, when he and other executives analyze the contents of these documents, they find a list of 18 potential distributors and a schedule of appointments with half of them. So, okay. This was not just like a misunderstanding. Onitsuka is actively looking for replacement distributors in the U S. Eventually Onitsuka reveals their true intentions when they offer to buy Blue Ribbon. So, I mean, just imagine this situation. Your whole company is that you are a distributor for this Japanese shoe company, and that company has just revealed their intention to cut you out. Now, these are the moments where legends are made because the average person. It's just despair. Like, that's it. Onitsuka can buy us for pennies on the dollar because our company is worthless without them. We have no product. And to be fair, Phil Knight also has many moments of despair. But he doesn't stay there. He doesn't stay in depression. He doesn't stay inactive. He says, look, if they're going to try and replace us, we need to try and replace them. And so he goes out looking and eventually finds a new manufacturer in Mexico to produce their own shoes. You know, rather than this pre existing brand of Tiger shoes, they can have their own. Now, technically, this is not a violation of their contract, because he's going to be manufacturing football shoes at first. And the contract only said that Blue Ribbon couldn't import other track and field shoes. It was, of course, a violation of the spirit of the deal, but as far as Phil Knight was concerned, Onitsuka had already broken the spirit of the deal by trying to find new distributors. He was just returning the favor. But now that they're manufacturing their own line of shoes, they need a name and a logo to go with this line for the logo.

But now that they ' re manufacturing their own line of shoes , they need a name and a logo to go with this line for the logo . He goes with Nike founder Phil Knight: a young artist he had met at Portland state named Carolyn Davidson. She had done some brochures for them and he says to her, Hey, we need a new logo. And she says, what kind? And he says, I don't know, something maybe that evokes a sense of motion. And so she comes back with some initial designs, you know, some lightning bolts, some wind. And they give her some feedback and, uh, you know, they go through, uh, and you know, they go through a few rounds of revisions where Phil tells her to make it sleeker, make it simpler. And then there's no aha moment. Like they look at one design and, uh, he and Jeff Johnson and a couple other executives say, yeah, I mean, I think we like this one a little better than the others reading now from the book quote, it looks like a wing. One of us said, it looks like a whoosh of air. Another said, it looks like something, a runner might leave in his or her wake. We all agreed it looked new, fresh, and yet somehow ancient, timeless. For her many hours of work, we gave Carolyn our deepest thanks and a check for 35, then sent her on her way. After she left, we continued to sit and stare at this one logo, which we'd sort of selected and sort of settled on by default. Something eye catching about it, Johnson said. Woodle agreed. I frowned, scratched my cheek. You guys like it more than I do, I said, but we're out of time. It'll have to do. You don't like it, Woodle said. I sighed, I don't love it. Maybe it will grow on me. I just love that. I love how honest Phil Knight is about the messiness. That was the origin of Nike. That was his initial reaction to the swoosh. One of the most famous logos of all time. I don't love it. Maybe it will grow on me. They also need a name, and the leading contenders are Falcon and Phil's personal favorite, Dimension 6. But they can't really decide, and finally the factory in Mexico needs an answer. They need to put something on the shoe. And Phil is still agonizing at the last minute. He doesn't love any of the options. And here's what happens. Reading once again from Shoe Dog.

Reading once again from Shoe Dog . There Nike founder Phil Knight: is one more suggestion, Woodle said. From who? Johnson phoned first thing this morning, he said. Apparently a new name came to him in a dream last night. I rolled my eyes. A dream? He's serious, Woodle said. He's always serious. He says he sat bolt upright in bed in the middle of the night and saw the name before him, Woodle said. What is it, I asked, bracing myself. Nike. Huh? Nike. Spell it. N I K E, Woodle said. I wrote it on a yellow legal pad. The Greek goddess of victory. The Acropolis. The Parthenon. The Temple. I thought back. Briefly. Fleetingly. We're out of time. I said, Nike Falcon or dimension six. Everyone hates dimension six. Everyone but me. He frowned. It's your call. He left me. I made doodles on my pad. I made lists, cross them out. Tick tock, tick tock. I needed to tell effects the factory. Now I hated making decisions in a hurry. And that's all I seem to do those days. I looked to the ceiling. I gave myself two more minutes to mull over the different options. Then walk down the hall to the Telex machine. I sat before it, gave myself three more minutes. Reluctantly, I punched out the message. Name of new brand is A lot of things went Man, clogged up now. A lot of things were rolling around in my head. Consciously, unconsciously. First Johnson had pointed out that seemingly all iconic brands Clorox, Kleenex, Xerox have short names. Two syllables or less. And they always have a strong sound in the name. A letter like K or X that sticks in the mind. That all made sense. Also, I liked that Nike was the goddess of victory. What's more important, I thought, than victory? I might have heard, in the far recesses of my mind, Churchill's voice. You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word. It is victory. I might have recalled the victory medal awarded to all the veterans of World War II. A bronze medallion with Athena and Nike on the front, breaking a sword in two. I might have. Sometimes I believe that I did. But in the end, I don't really know what led to my decision. Luck? Instinct? Some inner spirit? Yes. What did you decide?

{"text": "in two . I might have . Sometimes I believe that I did . But in the end , I don ' t really know what led to my decision . Luck ? Instinct ? Some inner spirit ? Yes . What did you decide ? Whittle asked me at Nike founder Phil Knight: the end of the day, Nike. I mumbled, Hmm. He said, yeah, I know. I said, maybe it'll grow on us. He said, maybe. So both the logo and the name of one of the world's greatest brands is born with the deepest reluctance. Again, you don't have to have it all figured out right away. I think, um, I think the full picture emerges as time goes on, kind of grows organically as it did with Nike. Now the quality of the Mexican factory is a disappointment, and so they decide to go back to Japan, not with Onitsuka, of course, who they are drifting away from, but with a large holding company, but with a large holding company called Nisho Corporation. Nisho agrees to a simple deal, Nisho agrees to a simple deal where they get no equity in blue ribbon Nike, but they will get 4 percent off the top as a markup on the product and market interest rates on top of that. And so in a few short months, the future of Nike was born. They eventually changed the corporate name from Blue Ribbon to Nike, and this completely changed the makeup of the company. Previously, Onitsuka was the maker of the shoe. Blue Ribbon had input, they offered designs, but they didn't really own their own designs. Now, they were making their own shoes, and this change unleashes their creativity. Bowerman immediately starts experimenting. He uses a waffle iron and fills it with polyurethane to try to make a waffle iron design for a shoe sole. The polyurethane actually seals the waffle iron shut, doesn't work, but after some experimentation, they do produce a waffle iron outsole, and that is one of the first major innovations of Nike shoes. Phil Knight writes in Shoe Dog, I look back over the decades and see him toiling in his workshop, Mrs. Bowerman carefully helping, and I get goosebumps. He was Edison in Menlo Park, Da Vinci in Florence, Tesla in Wa Tesla in Wardenclyffe. Divinely inspired. I wonder if he knew, if he had any clue, That he was the Daedalus of sneakers. I wonder if he knew, if he had any clue, that he was the Daedalus of sneakers. That he was making history, remaking an industry, transforming the way athletes would run and stop and jump for generations.

{"text": "history , remaking an industry , transforming the way athletes would run and stop and jump for generations . I wonder if he could conceive in that moment all that he ' d done , all that would follow . I know I couldn ' t . So 1973 is Nike founder Phil Knight: the year where all this happens. It's very awkward for a while, they still have to fulfill their obligations to Onitsuka, and they need to, you know, they desperately need that revenue, even as they are basically cheating on them with Nisho Corp and the new Nike line. Of course, once the Nike comes out, Onitsuka ends the relationship almost immediately. Now, even though the first Nike had sold well, this is devastating. Nike was just starting, they had this whole million dollar business selling Onitsuka shoes. Phil Knight calls an all hands meeting and tells everyone the situation. When he reveals that Onitsuka is cutting them off, everyone becomes despondent. Their initial reaction is, you know, like, so, okay, this is it then. And we had a good run, we have no shoes to sell, you know, Nike's just fledgling. But then Phil goes on, reading again from Shoe Dog, he says, I cleared my throat. So in other words, I said, I cleared my throat again, pushed aside my yellow legal pad. What I'm trying to say is, we've got them right where we want them. Johnson lifted his eyes. Everyone around the table lifted their eyes. They sat up straighter. This is the moment, I said. This is the moment we've all been waiting for. Our moment. No more selling someone else's brand. No more working for someone else. Onitsuka has been holding us down for years. Their late deliveries, their mixed up orders, their refusal to hear and implement our design ideas. Who among us isn't sick of dealing with all that? It's time we face the facts. If we're going to succeed or fail, we should do so on our own terms with our own ideas. Our own brand. We posted two million in sales last year, none of which had anything to do with Onitsuka. That number was a testament to our ingenuity and our hard work. Let's not look at this as a crisis. Let's look at this as our liberation. Our independence day. Yes. It's going to be rough. I won't lie to you. We're definitely going to war people, but we know the terrain. We know our way around Japan now. And that's one reason I feel in my heart, this is a war we can win.

And if we win it , when we win it , I see great Nike founder Phil Knight: things for us on the other side of victory. We are still alive. People, we are still alive. Okay. So again, that's some great rah rah stuff. Onitsuka of course, sues them for everything they're worth. Nike counter sues. It's a long and dramatic lawsuit. But in the end. Nike wins and stays alive and even get some damages awarded to them from Onitsuka. They signed their first athletes in the coming months, notably Steve Prefontaine, who comes to work for Nike in 1973. Pre, as he was known, was a running phenomenon, a legend, and he becomes an important evangelist for Nike. If you want to know more about that story, you can go listen. That's just two episodes ago. So things are looking up, but it is the first year that they actually lose money. And of course they do, you know, you can't go from a full fledged operation selling one brand for eight years and And then just shut down that business and expect to not feel the repercussions. But essentially after one down year, things immediately start bouncing back and bounce back in a very dramatic way. By 1977, their sales increased to 70 million. And still, even at these things, And still, even at these levels, things are basically doubling every year. So by 1979, they are on track for 140 million of revenue. That is the year they introduced apparel for the first time. The thought was that some athletes were choosing Adidas over Nike because they could offer athletes more. An entire look, tracksuits, shoes, shirt, shorts, everything. And so Nike felt they needed to compete. And this is of course, increases revenue even further, just more revenue streams. üìç One quick break to tell you that this episode is brought to you by all the hacks, all the hacks is a great podcast.

That is all the hacks Nike founder Phil Knight: and you can listen to it wherever you get your podcasts. üìç So things are looking up. Things are still growing, still growing very fast. However, in that year, Phil Knight receives a simple letter in the mail from the U S federal government. He opens it up and can't believe what he sees. It's a bill for 25 million. Now Nike was already broke. They were growing so fast. They were operating at the red line. They had no free cash, 25 million would sink them. And it turns out that this was a dirty trick by their competitors. Basically, there was a law that you had to pay certain import duties based not on the price of your shoe, but on the price. Of an equivalent shoe manufactured in America. Well, a competitor had manufactured a shoe in the U S and marketed it for 250 or something crazy. Shoes are basically selling for maybe 20 at the time. So the competitors do this just to benchmark and say, look, uh, here's a competitive shoe for 250. So you have to put import duties on these shoes that are selling for 20 as if they're 250 shoes. So it racks up this huge tax bill, just totally illegitimate. It's a dirty trick working with the federal government, but it works. And so the government's telling them you owe us 25 million. And so eventually it has to become Phil Knight's top priority. This is existential. He goes out to Washington, DC and does much of the lobbying himself. It's just amazing how for the first two and a half decades of this, It's just amazing how for the first two decades of its existence, Nike's experiencing basically one extended near death experience. I think, you know, you'd expect something as successful as Nike, at least what it is now, you'd expect it to be stable earlier. But no, it is banking issues nearly putting them out of business, and then their supplier nearly putting them out of business, and then the federal government nearly putting them out of business. In the end, Phil Knight's personal involvement and his lobbying pays off. He really, really wanted to win fully and completely and pay nothing. He thought that was right and just. But in the end, his lawyers and his team convince him that that's not possible. And they end up paying a settlement of eight million dollars to the federal government. , so one more", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/nike-founder-phil-knight", "title": "Nike founder Phil Knight", "chunk_index": 22, "publication_date": "2024-08-06", "total_chunks_in_doc": 30}}

And they end up paying a settlement of eight million dollars to the federal government . , so one more Nike founder Phil Knight: crisis averted. However, that isn't the last near death experience. So basically, money was always tight at Nike. So basically money was always tight at Nike. Um, that was because, so basically money was always tight at Nike. They had pretty thin operating margins and they were growing so fast that they just, you know, it was money was tough to, and they were growing so fast that cash was just always hard to come by. Any money that they made, you just went into largest, any money that they made basically always just went into larger purchase orders. And so they often had to get creative. And so they often had to get creative, uh, with their payments. Right. But Phil always had a rule and that was always pay Nisho first. Okay. So Nisho is this company in Japan that was manufacturing for them. Yes. But was also a financial partner essentially was making them loans to keep them financially afloat. And, uh, the bank that they were with only was willing to take them on because they had this relationship with Nisho. And so he said, look. We pay Nisho first, everything else comes out of that. If we ever don't pay Nisho, we're going to have problems, right? So we got to keep them happy. One month, however, they owe Nisho a million dollars, the first ever million dollar payment, and they did not have a million dollars lying around. They were 75, 000 short. And so he's, you know, Phil Knight is talking with his team and he says, well, you know, I got this rule. We always pay Nisho first. They say, yeah, but, I mean, if we're gonna pay Nisho a million dollars, we're gonna have to drain a million dollars. All of our other bank accounts, all dry, like zero money. Now they had made big payments to Nisha before, not this big, but big payments. And always they had had enough balance in a day or two, like things had refreshed. Uh, they're looking at it and it doesn't seem that much worse. It might take three or four days instead. And so Phil decides that it's worth the risk. And so he pays Nisha.

So I was forever pushing my conservative bankers to the brink, forcing them into a game of chicken. I'd order a number of shoes that seemed to them absurd. A number we'd need to stretch to pay for. And I'd always just barely pay for them in the nick of time. And then just barely pay our other monthly bills at the last minute, always doing just enough and no more to prevent the bankers from booting us. And then at the end of the month, I'd empty our accounts to pay me show and start from zero again. Okay. So that's what he's doing here. He's playing this game of chicken, always just barely covering everything. So they do this to make the million dollar payment. Then the CFO calls him. It's all hitting the fan. She said the checks, all the checks are bouncing all over the company. That means suppliers aren't being paid. That means distributors aren't being paid. That means employees aren't being paid. All of these people are trying to cash checks. And all of them are bouncing, which looks horrible. There's a near mutiny at a small factory in New England where they were doing some manufacturing. And, um, so his man on the ground there is calling Phil Knight to say like, Hey, what's happening? You know, our guys aren't getting paid. Their, their checks are bouncing And these guys are threatening to quit and go home. And so he actually can't wait to hear back from Phil. And so he goes to one of their suppliers, the guy who was supplying them with the cardboard boxes, right? For the shoes, uh, those famous orange Nike cardboard boxes. And, uh, he says, look, you guys, if you want to stay in business, a huge part of your business is giving us cardboard boxes. If you want to stay in business, you need us to stay in business. I need you to help pay my factory workers.

It ' s just hopefully a short term loan , but can you do something for Nike founder Phil Knight: us? And so he leaves with a stack of a hundred dollar bills to pay their factory workers, and that's how he keeps it open, but it gets worse than that. Way worse, but it gets worse than that. Way worse. So, first of all, like I said, they've got distributors, you know, sporting goods stores all over the country that are having their checks bounce. And, uh, and so they're mad. Uh, they've got other, They've got other suppliers, uh, like they have checks bouncing all over the country, left and right, and their bank can't believe this. Uh, so they, you know, this bank didn't really want them from the start and then word gets to them and they ask for a meeting and coldly tell them, gentlemen, You are no longer welcome to bank with us. They throw them out worse. They call the next day and tell them that they are worse. They call them the next day and tell them that they are relaying information to the FBI as a major fraud case. So as Phil goes home from this meeting with their bank, he is considering the very real possibility that he might spend time in prison. Okay. So that really puts things in perspective of how bad this financial situation. Okay. In the meantime, they have half a dozen creditors who are all flying uninvited to Portland to go to Nike headquarters to see what the heck is going on and why their checks are bouncing. These are suppliers and distributors, people they need to continue operating. What unravels next. He's a farce worthy of Broadway, worthy of Hollywood. The great fear is that all these creditors who are flying at the same time, we'll see each other and realize the extent of this crisis. What they want to do is convince all these creditors that this is a minor hook. What they want to do is convince all these creditors that this is a minor hiccup in book. What they want to do is convince all these creditors that this is a minor hiccup in bookkeeping that will quickly be resolved. And so they set up a plan to keep all these various creditors quarantined In separate parts of the building, they set up an air traffic control, someone who tracks the movements of all these people to make sure they don't bump into each other. So if, so they've got someone assigned to each creditor and they take them to rooms in, in different corners", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/nike-founder-phil-knight", "title": "Nike founder Phil Knight", "chunk_index": 25, "publication_date": "2024-08-06", "total_chunks_in_doc": 30}}

So if , so they ' ve got someone assigned to each creditor and they take them to rooms in , in different corners Nike founder Phil Knight: of the building. And so let's say that one of these people says, Hey, I need to use the restroom. Then they call it into air traffic control. And so if another creditor in another part of the building says, I need to use the bathroom, they have to stall for a few minutes to make sure these people don't meet in the hall or in the bathroom, don't run into each other. And miraculously, this ploy works and all the creditors go home, believing that Nike can sort this out. So now they actually have to, so now they actually do have to sort it out. The best solution, the best solution they decide was to go to Nisho. The plan is to ask for both an extension on their next payment and some additional funding alone. Nisho says, look, you guys are growing. We like you, but this is highly irregular. If we're going to do this, if we're going to make you a loan, we're going to need someone to come out and comb through all of your books. Okay. Well, good. It sounds like the contours of a deal. There's just one minor problem. Nisho was two things to Nike, a financier and a manufacturer. Well, conditions had changed in Japan and Phil Knight was highly skeptical that they could continue to do all their manufacturing in Japan for forever. And so he had bought and fixed up a factory in new England, the one with the aforementioned problem, paying their workers. And they had, of course, kept this secret from Nisho that they were using Nisho's funding to build a factory to replace them as their manufacturer. Okay, so you get that? So Nisho is their manufacturer and their financier, and so they had used some of the money from Nisho to replace them as a manufacturer. And so, if Nisho, and so, if someone from Nisho comes out and opens the books, they would of course see all of the money that they had spent. So if someone from Nisho came out and opened the books, they would of course see all this money that got spent on a factory. To replace them. Oof, not good. Well, at this point, Phil Knight is saying, all right, well, what other choice do we have? And so they say, all right, send someone out. And so, and so Nisho sends out an executive named Ito.

And so , uh , Nisho sends out a high Nike founder Phil Knight: ranking executive named Ito. He arrives in Portland and, uh, comes to their offices and they give him everything. They give him all the books, no use trying to hide it. It was a glaring gap in the accounting and Ito was going to find out about the factory sooner or later. So they just hand over the books to Ito and let him look through them. As he's looking over these books, Phil comes back in. As he's looking over these books, Phil comes back and checks on him every 15 minutes or so. And finally, he pops his head in one time, and he can see it in Ito's eyes, that he has seen the factory. Reading now, quote, I could smell it in the air. We'd reached that fateful moment. Leaning over the books, Ito realized what he was looking at, and did a slow double take. Exeter, secret factory. Then I saw the realization dawn, that he was the sucker who'd paid for it. He looked up at me and pushed his head forward on his neck, as if to say, Really? I nodded, and then he smiled. It was only a half smile, but it meant everything. Okay, so this Ito guy, you know, he's able to kind of see the forest through the trees. And, uh, he realizes, look, you know, maybe it wasn't plausible that we would stay your manufacturer for forever anyway. And, um, this is what you guys had to do. And so before he leaves, he lets Phil know that they still have a deal. And says, quote, There are worse things than ambition. Not only does Nisho agree to the deal, but Ito comes to a meeting with Nike's bank, the Bank of California. And first of all, they pay off all of Nike's outstanding debts. And then Ito tells the bank, quote, there's one more thing. He said, I believe your bank has been negotiating in San Francisco to become one of Nisho's banks. That's right. That's right. The banker responded. Ah, I must tell you that it will be a waste of your time to pursue those negotiations any further. Are you sure he asked? I am quite sure.

Well, that was really the last near death experience of Nike's young life. The book ends with Nike going public. Phil had resisted going public for a long time because he was afraid that he would lose control and Nike would lose its soul. But they're able to pull together a deal where Phil Knight maintains 46 percent of the company, Bill Bowerman had already sold back most of his ownership, and the stock bought through the public offering would be Class B stock, which would give them fewer voting rights, meaning Phil still had effective control of Nike. Of course, Nike would still have many ups and downs. Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, the sweatshop controversies in China, you know, the sweatshop controversies in China, stuff we're all familiar with. But the future of Nike was secure. With the public offering, they raised enough capital that there would be no more near death experiences. At the end, Phil expresses his regrets. The biggest of his regrets is his relationship with his two sons. I think Phil was a pretty good father, but he just wasn't present enough to develop as strong of a relationship as he would have liked, and probably as would have been healthy. And so that's a big regret of his. He wished he had been able to spend more time with his boys. But, he's honest that this is tempered by his acknowledgement of his other one great regret. He says, quote, And yet I know that this regret clashes with my other secret regret, that I can't do it all over again. God, how I wish I could relive the whole thing. So should Phil Knight have done what he did? Or should he have been more con So should Phil Knight have done what he did? Or should he have been content to be an accountant and spend more time with his kids? I don't think it's a question with a general answer that works for everyone.

Hello and welcome to how to take over the world. This has been Wilson. That was a passage from the network state by Balaji Srinivasan. Today I am doing something a little bit different for this episode. I don't always read biographies. And so while I am finishing the video editing for my upcoming episode on Arnold Schwarzenegger, I thought I would do a mini episode. On something else that I have been reading recently. And that is this, this book, the network state by Balaji Srinivasan. Like I said, not a biography, but I do think it will have some relevance for this audience. Um, it's subtitled how to start a new country. And so I thought it might have relevance for you because if you are the kind of person who is interested in a podcast called how to take over the world, you might also be interested in this idea of starting your own country. Those are both very large, ambitious ideas that I think attract, uh, the same sort of thinking. Additionally, I think there is some crossover with many of the biographies that we have covered on this show. And that is because great minds are often drawn towards creating their own Space, whether that is a city or a country or something like that. I mean, uh, the classic example to me is Disney with Epcot. So Epcot originally was not supposed to be an amusement park. Like it is today. Epcot stands for experimental prototype community of tomorrow. And it was explicitly supposed to be a futuristic city, not an amusement park, supposed to have new futuristic forms of transportation, communication, working, eating, and everything. You know, Walt Disney was really obsessed with this idea of creating a new city, like an actual city that people lived in. That's what Epcot was supposed to be, and unfortunately he died, uh, during its creation, and so, uh, the people following Walt Disney did not have the same level of ambition and vision, and so it just got turned into what it is today, which is, uh, an amusement park in Disney World.

And my favorite is Bucephalopolis, the city that he named after his horse.

And my favorite is Bucephalopolis , the city that he named after his horse . You can also look at Brigham Young , who How To Start a Country : Network State Review: I've done episodes on, someone who founded essentially his own kingdom in the desert of the American West. You can look at Leonardo da Vinci, the last great project of his life. The last thing that he worked on was a new futuristic city, exactly like Epcot. It was specifically designed for beauty. Yes, he was an artist, but also for sanitation and cleanliness and he was trying to engineer, uh, both a cleaner and more efficient way to live. So A lot of it was designed around avoiding many of the sanitary issues that cause diseases in so many medieval and renaissance cities in Europe. You can even look at Steve Jobs and his spaceship, Office Park, uh, that Apple now operates out of, and that he designed. He also took a very close interest in the design of Pixar's offices, going so far as to be involved himself in the bricks in the exterior of Pixar's offices. He, uh, took a very close look at the colors and the layout of the bricks to make sure it looked accurate. Absolutely perfect. I even find some similarities in the way that when he retired, Rockefeller spent most of his days designing and building this great property in upstate New York. He became an amateur landscape architect and was laying roads, building houses, designing golf courses. And this was much more than just his personal house. The property had over 50 buildings on it. He really spent his time building this bucolic village for himself, his family and his And by the way, one of the reasons that Rockefeller built this entire complex is that he was getting more and more famous and he wanted some place that he could still have friends and associates and socialize with people so that he didn't have to totally close himself off from the world. Cause he was always worried about people snooping, people trying to dig up dirt on him, , to, to find anything that they could use against him, which is something that we all have to worry about these days because, we all have data footprints now that people can use. They can sell our data. Cyber criminals can even use it against you. And the good news is that you have the right to protect your privacy by requesting that data brokers delete your information.

So what does this actually mean? What is a network state? What is Balaji talking about? I read that definition at the beginning, but what does that mean when the rubber hits the road, what does it mean to found your own country? there Is a slightly more in depth definition that biology gives. He says a network state is a social network with a moral innovation, a sense of national consciousness, a recognized founder, a capacity for collective action, an in person level of civility and integrated cryptocurrency, a consensual government limited by a social smart contract, an archipelago of crowdfunded physical territories, a virtual capital, And an on chain census that proves a large enough population and income. Okay. So that's a lot to digest. That's a lot all in one. So let's break it down. Here's how I would explain what a network state is. At least this is what it is in my brain. A network state is a community, a group of people. Who want to share a way of life. That's kind of that simple. It starts with that. And rather than coming together and trying to get thousands of people to move to a new city or a new country, or settle some new land, they will share a way of life by organizing on the internet and in small communities dotted all over the world. So Bology lays out a detailed process for how he thinks this will happen. So first you have an online community and there are many of these, these already exist, and then those communities start holding meetups. You know, they start getting together on an ad hoc, temporary basis, uh, in person, then that community starts to acquire some sort of physical land or space. So you think, all right, we're having these in person meetups.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/how-to-start-a-country-network-state-review", "title": "How To Start a Country : Network State Review", "chunk_index": 2, "publication_date": "2024-03-14", "total_chunks_in_doc": 11}}

So you think , all right , we ' re having these in person meetups . How To Start a Country : Network State Review: Why don't we actually just buy a little house? We'll all pitch in and these are where we can have our meetups and we can spend some time together. And then they form what he calls a network union. So what is that? It's a way of taking collective action and participating in collective bargaining. So let's say that maybe you and a million of your closest friends were in one of these communities, and most of you are remote workers. Maybe it would take the form of bargaining tax rates with various governments saying, Hey, we have these remote workers and we like to live together and we mostly work remote. So we're very mobile, but guess what? If you Portugal, Columbia, El Salvador, Canada, the U S if you offer us a better tax rate, then we will encourage more of our members to move to your country. And this will stimulate your economy. Um, we get a better tax rate, um, for ourselves. So win, win, et cetera. So this is a network union. That's the next logical step for biology for these online communities. And then you start acquiring more and more land, you know, little cul de sacs, office buildings, apartment buildings, neighborhoods. And these are all over the world. They're not centralized in one single city. And then finally you get to a size and scale that you've got property all over the world and millions of members. And so you can get diplomatic recognition as a state, not a nation state. Not like the U. S. or Mexico or France or England, but a network state with distributed territory in many different locations. So that is how he imagines these things coming into reality. Uh, I think that sounds really fun and interesting. Balaji has a good quote about why people would want to do this. He writes, we want to be able to peacefully start a new state for the same reason we want a bare plot of earth, a blank sheet of paper, an empty text buffer, a fresh startup, or a clean slate, because we want to build something new without historical constraint. And I think that really resonates with me. I love starting something new. Um, and this is like the biggest kind of coolest thing you could start. Starting businesses, starting charities, you know, these other things that you could found are very cool. Very interesting.

Very interesting . That ' s a large part of what we talk about here on How To Start a Country : Network State Review: the show, but starting your own country, like that is kind of on another level. Right. And I just think that, you know, St. Peter's or St. Paul's or Notre Dame or the Washington monument. Are cooler than Facebook or Twitter or anything like that. So, , I think it's an interesting idea, but of course, , there's more to it. It's not just the thrill of starting something new at the beginning of his definition. Biology defines a network state as a social network with a moral innovation. Okay. A moral innovation. What is that? And a moral innovation could be anything, but the point is moral innovations must serve as a critique of the current way of doing things. Otherwise, what's the point, right? So this is a major key to what he's proposing. It's one of the most important points, but also one of the most daunting, because it means you're going to have to develop a new morality. In some way, and that is of course going to be very challenging to the status quo, and therefore probably very controversial. So what could that look like? What is a moral innovation? So a few examples, um, he gives some of these. You might have heard of effective altruists. These are people that are Most of them are located in the Bay Area, who believe in doing good, in alleviating suffering in the world. They are altruists, you know, philanthropists, but they are effective altruists. They believe in being extremely rigorous and quantitative in measuring the impact of what you're doing and reorienting your life around how you can possibly have the maximum impact possible. So as an example, probably the most famous effective altruist, for better or for worse, is Sam Bankman Freed. And he, before he went to jail, explored the idea of how much money would he have to pay for Donald Trump not to run for president. So he starts quantifying, all right, how much money would it take first of all? And then how much good would it do? And so I think he started to come down to a number like 5 billion. And so then he runs the analysis of, okay. Um, would that 5 billion do more good convincing Donald Trump not to run for president? Or spending those 5 billion building wells or buying mosquito nets in Africa. Now, obviously you hear a story like that and you start to think, okay, maybe", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/how-to-start-a-country-network-state-review", "title": "How To Start a Country : Network State Review", "chunk_index": 4, "publication_date": "2024-03-14", "total_chunks_in_doc": 11}}

Now , obviously you hear a story like that and you start to think , okay , maybe How To Start a Country : Network State Review: these effective altruists are not always as smart as they think they are. But we're just using that as an example. Right. And I think effective altruists is a great example of a type of community that you could possibly create a network state around on the flip side of that, uh, kind of similar, kind of very different community are effective accelerationists. So these are people who believe that the greatest good is created, not through philanthropy, but through technological progress. So instead of spending all your time thinking about how to philanthropically improve the world, you should be thinking according to them about how to make better robots, better AI, cheaper energy, more efficient transportation, stuff like that. And so similarly, this is a moral innovation that has a strong critique of the current system. Hey, we spend too much time on regulation and redistribution. Actually, the most important thing is technological progress. And we should orient our lives and our society around that. Okay. Again, I'm not advocating for either of these worldviews. I think these are two worldviews that do have a strong moral innovation and therefore good candidates to start a network state biology also describes a few other groups that could have relatively simple moral innovations. So you could have a network state or a community built around dietary ideas. So like a paleo community or keto or vegan, you could also, uh, Just work with preexisting groups that have some sort of moral innovation. So for example, religion is an easy one to go to. So two examples that he brings up frequently are Jews and Mormons, And you could see pretty easily how those two groups could form into network states, you know, both of them with the exception of Israel, but, uh, Mormons and Jews are minorities in every country in which they live. They often form close knit communities that have a lot in common. And so it'd be pretty easy for them. To, um, come together in little neighborhoods and areas and form this sort of international community. So in Baloji's mind, everyone from effective altruists to Mormons to vegans are a good candidate. For forming a network state. Another part of the definition is he calls for a sense of national consciousness and national identity. And that is a high bar to clear.

He says, Conversely, woke America is to America. As Soviet Russia was to Russia. It is the most left wing country in the world. The place where whites go to the back of the line for vaccinations and the self admitted sponsor of global revolution. Its core premise is ethnomassacism, which can be paraphrased as white people. So, um, he takes this very strong racial view, saying that America is far too woke, and that makes it impossible to get anything done, , at least anything productive. And, um, so that's one of his main reasons for wanting to You know, new systems, new, new states, new ways of doing things.

Or should it be neither? And so he goes on to imagine a state in which it's animating force is neither to demonize nor support a particular ethnicity, but one, which is freed to think about much more important and interesting. So, you know, this is not a political show. I'm not going to comment on Balaji's critique, but I will say I agree with him that there is a lot to critique about our current system. I think everyone feels that way, left or right. And in my mind, the current system falls short. Most of all, I think the thing that bothers me most about modern life, uh, it doesn't seem to do a good job of giving people purpose or meaning or belonging. I think that is one of the reasons that I am most excited about this idea. of a network state, uh, is because I think these could give people belonging and purpose. Um, so, you know, that begs the question, why is it, what is it about the current way of doing things, uh, that leads us to feel like, oh, we don't have purpose or meaning and stuff like that. And I think, um, there's a lot of different answers. One thing that always comes back to is I think a big part of it is the end of what I call Uh, and I'm not the one who coined this phrase owned space. So go through a mental exercise with me. Uh, you walk outside your house. And there is a sidewalk, a street lamp, uh, a road. Do you feel like you own that sidewalk, that street lamp, you know, at least in part, like obviously it's not your personal property. But do you feel like this is something you have a stake in? I think most people don't feel that way. Um, we don't feel like part owners of our government. I think for most people there is an adversarial or at least an orthogonal relationship with the government at every level. And that is what citizenship is supposed to be, right?

I think for a positive example, a good example of citizenship in action, all you need to do is turn back the clock a little bit. On America itself. So citizenship here used to be very strong. Uh, there's a great story that I think illustrates this. It's from Alexis de Tocqueville, who was a French aristocrat who came to America and wrote a book called democracy in America, and he was writing to a European audience, especially a French one. In the early 1800s about what made America unique and there's one passage that I find striking about criminals in America. So he writes during my stay in the United States. I witnessed the spontaneous formation of committees for the pursuit and prosecution of a man who had committed a great crime in a certain County. In Europe, a criminal is an unhappy being who is struggling for his life against the ministers of justice, whilst the population is merely a spectator of the conflict. In America, he is looked upon as an enemy of the human race and the whole of mankind. He's against him. And I think that's an interesting point, right? You can see the difference there between people who are subjects. So a crime happens and they're like, all right, that's got nothing to do with me. Okay. Okay, I'm just a bystander. I'm just watching. And people who are citizens who say, Well, this is my town, and so if there's a criminal on the loose, then yes, you know, if I feel like I'm literally a part owner with a stake in this particular place, then I want to catch this criminal. You know, I'm going to grab my gun and help go look for him. You know, certainly if a criminal was loose in your yard, A place that you really do feel ownership of, you would never think that this is none of your business and leave it to the professionals. \\ Right. Like you have an actual responsibility for this place because you own it. And so the fact that none of us are tempted to do this, to like pick up our weapons and go look for criminals and like, we just don't care for our towns and cities like we would if we were actual citizens with actual owned space.

Now, maybe I'm an extremist in this regard. I am an American. More than an American. I'm a westerner. You know, my, I was born in California. My dad was born in Idaho. His dad was born in Utah. And, you know, it's just a slow march across the United States. Every generation. Left and started somewhere new because they liked this idea of, of starting a new thing out on the frontier. So maybe I am genetically pre programmed to want this own space and, and, um, to want to build something new, but I don't think so. I actually do think that this is a common yearning for almost all people. And so I think a network state is a wonderful chance to recapture that. A new deliberate community freely entered into easily left with an explicit proposition and a particular way of life, You can just see how that would lend itself towards thinking, okay, I'm an actual, uh, participant in this, in a joint project and not just a spectator, a subject in a system, which I have no real input in. In fact, if I were to start my own network state, I think it would be to resurrect this very ideal, the American ideal of citizenship and owned space. And I And I say American, it's not really an idea that's owned by America. It's as old as the idea of citizenship itself. The idea came to us from Rome. I mean, go look at America's oldest federal symbols. They all evoke Rome when Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison wrote the Federalist Papers in defense of the American constitution. They did so with what pen name? Publius, you know, hearkening back to the Roman Republic. When you go to the rostra of the house of representatives, what do you see? Roman fascists go look at the columns of the Supreme court building. America is nothing if not Rome reborn. So yeah, America has, uh, no monopoly on this idea of citizenship. Of course, I think of it as American because I am American. That's, that's kind of how it comes to me. But, um, I think this is an ideal that would appeal to a lot of people. I don't know.

This is episode one. on the life of George Washington, the great American general and statesman, and the first president of the United States of America. George Washington is really one of the great leaders of all time. He was able to lead the U. S. through a revolutionary war against the most powerful empire on Earth and come out victorious, and he came out universally beloved. That's one of the things that I think is so interesting about George Washington. is in his own lifetime, and afterwards, there was this ecstatic outpouring of almost worshipful devotion towards him. People just loved George Washington so much. He was, like, more myth than man. In fact, if you go to the capital of the United States, which is called Washington, and you go to the Capitol building and look at the interior of the Rotunda, you will see a fresco called the Apotheosis of Washington, and it depicts George Washington sitting as a god in judgment of America. You And that's interesting to me. What kind of person inspires that kind of devotion that verges on worship? What did he do? How did he do it? That's what I want to explore on this episode. This episode will focus on his life from his birth up until the eve of the American revolution. My sources are Washington Alife by Ron Chernow and George Washington The Forge of Experience by James Thomas Flexner. And you can find links for both of those in the show notes. So with all that said, let's get into it. This is The Making of George Washington. Before we get into it, one thing you will, of course, know about George Washington, if you have ever seen a quarter or a dollar bill, is that he was a businessman. Clean shaven.

{"text": "each shave . Yet , Henson users have seen dramatic improvements , including the disappearance of ingrown hairs and razor bumps . And no , it doesn ' t have anything to do with sharper blades . What it is , is they have innovative technology . Um , you George Washington: can think of a razor blade as a diving board. So the longer the board, the more it wobbles and the micro wobbles are what lead to more nicks and cuts. And so Henson solves this by minimizing blade extension. So you think of that diving board and it's like very rigid, very straight. And this addresses the root cause of bad shaves, not the blade itself, but the extension. So if that's the problem, if it's so simple, why don't other brands fix it? It's a manufacturing issue and they have that aerospace background. They really know how to do precision manufacturing. And so with their machines, they're able to achieve a blade extension of just 0. 0013 inches, less than the human hair's thickness. And that incredible precision of the blades position ensures a vibration free and incredibly close shave. And it's also incredibly cost effective once you own a Henson razor, it's only about 3 to 5 per year. To replace the blades.

Virginia was the largest and most prosperous of Great Britain's southern American colonies, and the Washingtons were an aristocratic family. They were well to do, but not quite at the very top of the social or economic ladder. Here is what Flexner writes about the Washington family in his biography. Although no Washington ever sat in the Virginia equivalent of the House of Lords, the King's Council, They often married above themselves. They continued important enough so that when they produced a transcendentally able scion, no eminence was considered in that semi aristocratic society, beyond their rightful reach. So no, the Washingtons were not at the very top of Virginia society, but they were high enough that it wouldn't be a surprise that the most powerful man in America would come from their ranks. So, a rags to riches story, this is not. George soon showed himself to be a very strong and distinctive personality. He was much like his father, who was", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/george-washington", "title": "George Washington", "chunk_index": 1, "publication_date": "2024-05-03", "total_chunks_in_doc": 96}}

George soon showed himself to be a very strong and distinctive personality . He was much like his father , who was George Washington: described as, and I love this quote, a blonde giant, fabulously strong, but miraculously gentle. Similarly, Flexner describes George Washington as quote imbued with the boat imbued with similarly Flexner describes George Washington as quote imbued with both sweetness and animal power. Okay, so I love that description, sweetness and animal power, and that leads to this very special charisma. If you've ever been to the gym. And you've, you know, had the biggest guy in the gym be nice to you, you know, tell you like, Hey man, nice shoulders or like, Hey, do you need help with that? Or, you know, it's like this great feeling to have the big dude. Be kind to you. And that's George Washington. He is, has this animal power. He's enormous. He's somewhere between six foot and six three, which is very tall for the time. And he's got this incredible strength. He's thick, strong, wide shouldered, long limbed. Um, and he has, you know, this beautiful Auburn hair and light grayish blue eyes. And one of the things people talk a lot about from his early life is just how strong he was. He was like the Schwarzenegger of his time. Strongest man in America. There's one story that I love that shows what a gifted athlete he was. So this is from the Flexner biography. He says, we get a more vivid picture from an account of this guy named peel. There's a story. We get a vivid picture from an account. We get a vivid picture from one account. The man writes me and several of the man writes several other gentlemen and I were pitching the bar during the stay. Okay. He writes, we get a vivid picture from an account of someone who was staying at Mount Vernon. He writes, we get a vivid picture from an account where this guy who's writing with several other, we get a vivid picture from an account where Peel, that's the guy who's writing, and several other gentlemen were pitching the bar during his stay at Mount Vernon. Pitching the bar is just a game of throwing a metal bar as far as you can. Like, really simple game. Who can throw it the furthest? And so they're playing this game and Washington appeared, quote, and requested to be shown the pegs that mark the bounds of our effort. Then, smiling and without putting off", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/george-washington", "title": "George Washington", "chunk_index": 2, "publication_date": "2024-05-03", "total_chunks_in_doc": 96}}
{"text": ". Like , really simple game . Who can throw it the furthest ? And so they ' re playing this game and Washington appeared , quote , and requested to be shown the pegs that mark the bounds of our effort . Then , smiling and without putting off George Washington: his coat, held out his hand for the missile. No sooner did the heavy iron bar feel the grasp of his mighty hand than it lost the power of gravitation and whizzed the air, striking the ground far. beyond the utmost limits. We were indeed amazed as we stood around, all stripped to the buff and short sleeves rolled up, and having thought ourselves very clever fellows, while the colonel, on retiring, pleasantly observed, When you beat my pitch, young gentleman, I'll try again. Okay. So in other words, these guys are playing a game of throwing an iron bar as far as they can, they're all stripped down to their shirts, sleeves rolled up, they're sweaty and George comes out and says, let me see that thing doesn't warm up, doesn't take off his coat. Just heaves the bar, crushes their best throw and walks away. So he was like a, a, a mythic man, genuinely. Of heroic stature and physical abilities. And it's not just brute strength. He had a grace to him as well. And athleticism. He was a very gifted horse rider and a very gifted dancer. Mentally, George Washington was not well educated, but he was intelligent. He received a rudimentary education in reading, writing, and arithmetic, as well as culture and history. He was expected like his father and his older brothers to be educated at the Appleby grammar school in England. And this was a good school for young aristocrats. But when George Washington was 11 years old. Which eliminated the possibility of him going to England for economic reasons and because he was now needed to help run things on the estate. He was always a little embarrassed by this lack of education, especially compared to some of his peers who were very well educated. But like I said, just because he wasn't well educated doesn't mean that he wasn't intelligent. I think sometimes his intelligence is discounted or overlooked, and Chernow has a good theory on why he writes. Washington has suffered from comparisons with other founders, several of whom were renowned autodidacts, but by any ordinary standard. He was an exceedingly smart man with a quick capability. He was an exceedingly smart, he was an exceedingly smart man with a quick ability to grasp ideas. He seized every interval of leisure to improve himself and showed a steady capacity to acquire and retain useful knowledge.

Okay , so yes , especially later in life , he was constantly surrounded by geniuses like Benjamin Franklin , George Washington: Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, John Adams, all of these guys probably had IQs of 140 or above. And Washington was clearly not that intelligent. But he was still brilliant. And that was evidenced in his military and political career, and in his business career, as we shall later see. But just because, you know, he wasn't, um, but just because he didn't have, like, Franklin level of intelligence doesn't mean he wasn't smart. He was very smart. One of the other things that he becomes known for very early in life, and this is something that's not widely known, Uh, this was a discovery for me, at least, is he was exceptionally well dressed. There's a story where he writes out a 152 word description of a coat he wants made for him from a tailor. And he writes to this tailor and writes a very, you know, detailed description of exactly how he wants the coat cut, down to how many inches apart the buttonholes should be, and everything. He believed, as Chernow writes, that a man's apparel was an outward sign of inner order. Okay, I like that a lot. A man's apparel is an outward sign of inner order. I really need a clothing or apparel sponsor to go here. Too bad. This is a missed opportunity. Maybe next time. But throughout his life, that is one thing that George Washington was known for. He was fashionable and exceptionally well dressed. So as I said, as a young man, he's only 11 and his father dies. And when that happens, his older brother inherits much of the plantation, much of the landownings that the Washingtons had and the rest that is kind of Washington's and the rest that is kind of George's portion actually goes to his mother because he's underage. His mother was very strong willed and she actually refused to give up this portion of the inheritance for a long time, which was disastrous for George because she turned out to not be a very good business woman. She was very strong willed, but not very capable of doing When it came to managing the estate and his mother is a very interesting character. She's very independent, very hard, very exacting, very religious, kind of grasping. She always undercut and downplayed her son's achievements. It's kind of sad.

{"text": "' s very independent , very hard , very exacting , very religious , kind of grasping . She always undercut and downplayed her son ' s achievements . It ' s kind of sad . She , uh , she lived to see him become president of the United George Washington: States. She lived a long time and still this did not satisfy her. You know, she was just one of those kind of hypercritical. Mother types. So with no father to kind of show Washington the ropes, he needed guidance and mentorship. And he found that in two places. The first was his older brother, Lawrence, with whom he was very close. And then just a couple of months after Washington's father died, Lawrence married a woman named Anne Fairfax. And she was the oldest daughter of William Fairfax. The Fairfax family was the wealthiest family in Virginia. They were both extremely wealthy and extremely well connected. So again, that is George Washington's older brother, Lawrence, Marries a Fairfax girl named Anne Fairfax and her father is the richest man in Virginia William Fairfax And so this marriage kind of pulls George into the Fairfax orbit He's able to meet them and he immediately makes an impression. They really like him so he becomes best friends with a boy named George William Fairfax and And then eventually develops this kind of surrogate father relationship with William Fairfax himself. Part of this kind of surrogate father, surrogate son thing is, you know, George's best friend, George William Fairfax, William Fairfax's son, is like, not that bright. He's fine, he's a good guy, but he's just a little dull. Whereas, you know, George Washington is strong, strapping, intelligent, ambitious. And so William Fairfax, Really takes a liking to George Washington. And so they have this strong mentor mentee relationship. He does two important things for George Washington initially. The first is he introduces him to the world of the ancient Romans. So George Washington becomes obsessed with Caesar, Alexander the Great, the Stoics, he reads Caesar's commentaries, he reads Seneca, he reads Plutarch's lives, and when he was older, he would order busts of Caesar and Alexander the Great and a few other great generals and conquerors. So that kind of gives him his pattern of life. Like a Roman of old, he is obsessed with public renown. Flexner writes, He explained that his motive was the hope of meriting the love of my country and the friendly regard of my acquaintances. Washington subscribed to the Stoic conception, which he thus phrased in 1781. The confidence and affections of his fellow citizens is the most valuable and agreeable reward a citizen can achieve.

And this is , of course , a pattern with the greats . They are obsessed with other greats who George Washington: came before them. Napoleon was obsessed with Caesar. Caesar was obsessed with Alexander the Great. Steve Jobs idolized Edwin Land. Thomas Edison idolized Michael Faraday. And for young George Washington, he took his inspiration from the great statesman of And so for young George Washington, he took his inspiration from great statesmen of old, like Caesar and Alexander, and also from more immediate examples like William Fairfax. The other thing William Fairfax does for George Washington is open doors. And the first door he opens for him is to get him a job as a surveyor. And so a surveyor is someone who goes out and surveys, yes. Surveys the land, maps it, sets it out, lays out lots, looks at where the property lines are, things like that. Today, um, no offense to any of my listeners who are surveyors, it's not like a super prestigious job, but at the time it was, and it was very important. And so George Washington is now the youngest surveyor in Virginia history at the tender age of 17. It's also a position that is laden with opportunity because if you're someone who wants to acquire land, well, now you're seeing where the land is. You're literally surveying it. Uh, you can see where the valuable land is, what turns a profit, what doesn't. So it's a very good position for George to be in. And he does in fact, Not only serve as a surveyor, but he starts trading on his own account. As a young man, he rapidly starts acquiring land and adding it to the family estate. And throughout all of this surveying and acquiring, he's also acquiring more and more friends. And a good reputation as someone who is both friendly and reliable. Flexner writes, with that sweetness that was part of his character, although it has fanned it. Flexner writes, George Washington charmed with that sweetness that was part of his character, although it has vanished from his legend. The adjective most often applied to him by those who knew him as a young man was amiable. Okay, so he's very amiable. He's just making friends everywhere he goes. And so that combination of amiability, friendliness, along with competence, means that a lot of people, um, Want to help him out, right?

With these powerful connections, they pay off when he has given another very important appointment. At this point, the United States was really only settled on the east coast. So you have the coast, then you have some civilization, and then you have these hills and mountains. And beyond that is the Ohio River Valley. And the Ohio Valley is, at this point, really sparsely settled. There's almost no one there. Mostly wilderness. But, at this point in time, you know, the, the late 18th But at this point in time, you know, the late 1700s, people are just starting to go over the hills and set up farms and settlements. But there's a problem in that you have the French, who are settled in Canada, who also think that they have a claim to the land. To this Ohio area. And so there's some conflict between the British colonists, like Washington and these French who are mostly trappers, hunters, and traders. And so someone, uh, and so the French are starting to cause problems. They're allying with the Indians and, um, and they're, and there are some minor conflicts. And so someone needs to go and make contact with the French troops in the area and say, Hey, what's going on here, guys, we see you building a fort, establishing a presence, making contact with the Indians, and so on. We want to make sure everything's clear here because we have the right to settle this land. You don't. So they need someone to go through the wilderness, which is unsettled. There are no roads to go contact the French and open diplomatic contact. And George Washington is given this diplomatic appointment to go out into the wilderness, find the French. And deliver a diplomatic letter. He's given this appointment because people like him. He's reliable, but also because he's been a surveyor. So he's sort of been out on the frontier already. He's a good woodsman. He knows how to hack it out there in the wilderness. So it's a dangerous journey. There are Indians, wild animals, half frozen rivers and difficult terrain. But Washington is able to find the French fort, make contact. And deliver the message. Crucially, when he's in the French fort, he tries", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/george-washington", "title": "George Washington", "chunk_index": 7, "publication_date": "2024-05-03", "total_chunks_in_doc": 96}}

You're, you're looking at men and they're kind of milling around. And so did I already count that guy? And some of them are indoors and some of them are going in and out. So he's like, I can't get an accurate count. So he tells his companion to go down to the river and count the number of canoes. So canoes don't move. They're just sitting there. They're easy to count. And so that gives them a more accurate picture of the French forces in the area. Yeah. It's a very clever bit of quick thinking from George to give him valuable intelligence that he can bring back to the colonial government. On the way back, he and his companion, uh, who's like a translator, knows French, um, and On the way back, he and his companion, who, crucially, knows French, served as a translator, they are shot at by an Indian and almost die when they try to cross a half frozen river. and an ice flow nearly capsizes the raft that they're on. But, they manage to make it back, and George's performance is widely hailed as nothing short of spectacular. Flexner writes, Reading the journal today, one is impressed with the greenness of the young man and the cockiness. There is no hint that at any moment he felt he had come up against anything he could not understand and could not handle. Yet he did handle everything. However bludgeringly at times, And he did handle everything. However, bludgeringly at times, he moved forward with dauntless energy, got where he was supposed to go, delivered his message, came home successfully through stupendous hardships, taken by itself, the physical vitality displayed was on the level of genius. Well, the message that he brings back from the French is not helpful. They basically tell the British, No, man, we belong here. And you guys can buzz off as far as we're concerned. So the British colonials gear up for conflict and start raising troops. And George Washington, even though he's very young, 21 years old at this point, is tapped to lead the troops of Virginia.

He says , how could young George Washington have snared this prestigious commission ? At the time , few George Washington: Virginians were seasoned in frontier warfare. Creating a simple lack of competitors. Washington confirmed that he was picked to go, quote, when I believed few or none would have undertaken it. Some practical reasons made Washington an excellent choice. He knew the western country from surveying, had the robust constitution to survive the winter woods, was mostly unflappable, had a mature appearance and sound judgment, and was a model youth with no tincture of rowdiness in his nature. So they tab Washington to lead the Virginia militia, but he actually doesn't want to do it at first. He says, I must be impartial enough to confess. It is a charge too great for my youth and inexperience, but he says he would be interested in the Lieutenant position. The second in command, he says, quote, with my own application and diligent study, I could in time render myself worthy of the position if under a skilled commander or man of sense. So I think that's actually a really smart approach, right? You're not doing yourself any favors. If you take a position that you're not ready for. So get yourself a good mentor and put yourself in a place to succeed. And so that's what happens. He's appointed second in command with a general over him. However, the guy who they appoint as the head of the army is old and fat and slow. And so in the meantime, George Washington has to take command while this other general makes his way to the troops. And the course of events are such that things start happening, and so he has to command in the absence of this other general. And actually, the other general, this guy, catches a disease and dies on the way. So he's like weeks or months, so he's like weeks or months in transit and then he dies. And so even though George Washington doesn't want to be the guy, the leader of the Virginia troops, that's what ends up happening anyway. And now he's the man. He's the leader. So even though George, so even though George Washington has all these trepidations about leading the troops, he shows no hesitation in leading them. So even though George Washington has all these hangups, all these trepidations about being the commanding general, he shows no hesitation in leading his men.

There's been frontier fighting with Indians. There are no experienced soldiers though. So like he's the blind leading the blind, but what does he do? He just goes straight out and attacks a superior French force. He just starts marching right towards them. And so they're marching and he actually hears about some French troops marching towards him. And so he takes out an advanced scouting detachment. And he actually stumbles on the French before he's ready. So the French fire on them, and they fire back, and they So the French fire on them, but Washington regroups his troops, and they fire back, and Washington actually gets the better of the French. And he likes this first taste of war. He loves battle. He writes back to his brother, I heard the bullets whistle, and believe me, There is something charming in the sound. So Washington's forces win this engagement, but as they're winning, they hear the French, you know, screaming out. They're throwing up their hands and they surrender. And when George Washington goes to talk to them, the French say, Hey, we're a diplomatic detachment. We were coming just to talk to you guys. We weren't here to fight. And Washington doesn't really believe this. He's like, well, then why did you fire on us first? You know, but they say, no, no, no, no. This is a big misunderstanding. We have diplomatic papers, and so you guys actually have been shooting and killing diplomats, which is a big international no no. And Washington says, yeah, I don't believe you, and so he takes the survivor's prisoner and goes back to his little fort that he has constructed in the forest. Now, Washington may or may not have been wrong in firing on these French soldiers. Maybe they really were being deceptive, okay? They had these diplomatic papers in case they got caught in a bad situation, but really they were coming to fight the British. That's what he believed, and that may have been true.

But what happens next is definitely George Washington: not an accident. The French attack this little fort that Washington has constructed, and he actually does a terrible job. This fort is badly positioned and not nearly strong enough to be defensible. And so what unfolds next is essentially a horror movie. Imagine, they are just huddled up in the cold weather They were just marching toward the British in order to deliver a diplomatic communique, in order to, awaiting this attack from a far superior French force. And this is what unfolds. Here's the quote from, here's the quote from Flexner. Awaiting this attack from a far superior French force, and this is what unfolds. üìç Quote. A bullet zinged into the fort, üìç and then another. üìç Even after the lead had become a downpour, he could see no üìç enemy. üìç Only powder smoke drifting üìç üìç upward from every little rising tree üìç stump, stone, and bush. üìç In what had been planned as safe positions leaped üìç and fell. The artillerymen were driven from their swivels. Anguished cries and bellows, üìç anguished cries and bellowing signaled that the horses üìç and beef cattle were going down under the constant üìç galling fire. Crouching low, Washington shunted his men to spots üìç that seemed to promise protection. üìç But as soon as they revealed their location by firing over the ramparts, üìç enemy bullets came in among them. Now, as he üìç tried to encourage his men, üìç Washington was slipping üìç on blood. But the casualties üìç were episodic. A slumped form here, a man crawling there.

And the üìç nightmare was able to drag on for hour after hour, with üìç enough colonials still upright to hold the attackers üìç at musket range. üìç So, after a few hours, After a few hours, one third of his üìç üìç men, more than a hundred, üìç were dead gasping out their lives or üìç contorted with various wounds.

The Virginians will be allowed to retreat with all military honors , a total ceasefire , and there are basically no conditions on George Washington: them, other than a very simple apology. And Washington was too young and inexperienced to realize the trap that was being laid for him. That simple apology was a huge mistake. It was essentially an admission that the British had known that the French force they had initially encountered and beaten was a diplomatic mission, and that they had assassinated them. Now, that was not true, but that was what he was admitting to in cleverly disguised language. in this treaty, in this treaty, in this ceasefire that he was signing. This would set off a diplomatic crisis that would result in what came to be known as the Seven Years War, which was essentially the first truly global war, with major fighting on five continents and millions of deaths. And George Washington, who Had set it off by signing this poison pill contract. Flexner writes concerning that little skirmish Voltaire was to write, such was the complication of political interests that a cannon shot fired in America could give The signal that set Europe in a blaze Washington had indeed shed the first blood in the seven years war. A conflict, which according to Frederick of Prussia, cost the lives of about 853,000 soldiers plus civilians by the hundreds of thousands. And even more damningly, Flexner goes on, On the European diplomatic level, Washington had prejudiced the moral position of the whole British Empire at the eve of a world war. A French poet exclaimed, The assassination of Jumonville is a monument of perfidy that ought to enrage eternity. While an English writer stated in a pamphlet published in both London and Boston, that the articles of capitulation Washington had signed at Fort Necessity were the most infamous a British subject ever put his hand to. Okay, so, disastrous decision by Washington. And I highlight this story because, okay, disastrous decision by Washington. And I highlight this story because, if you think that you have failed, that you have done something so stupid, a mistake so egregious, that you don't feel like you can come back from it, just remember that George Washington accidentally started a world war and put his nation in a compromised position at the start of it. If he can come back from that, you can overcome whatever little hurdles that you face. I mean, it is amazing. You know, if George Washington had died the next year, he would be known not as a great man, but as the idiot who started the seven years war and put Britain in a bad position in so doing.

So truly anything can be overcome . And so this kicks . And so George Washington: in the context of colonial Britain of Virginia, this kicks off a low level of conflict across the American frontier. So you had all these colonials, the note, so you had all these colonials, all these, you want to call them Americans, but they all consider themselves British subjects at the time. There's no independence yet. We can call them Americans. , all these Americans who had started to settle in these frontier regions. And now the French ally with the native Americans in that area. The Indians, they're called Indians at the time. So we'll just call them that. And the Indians had a pretty simple viewpoint, which was we're going to ally with whoever is not going to take our land. And so the French, their approach was not to settle and not to farm so much. They mostly, as I said earlier, send in trappers and traders and hunters, you know, they extract some resources, but they can get along pretty well with the Indians. They don't kick them off their land. Whereas the British, the Americans, the colonials are coming to settle. Okay. Okay. So the Indians correctly into it, we can coexist with the French, but the British, if their policy continues, they're going to lead to our extermination. And so they ally with the French and they start this low level conflict in which they are going and raiding all these outlying settlements. And so I know people get very, um, emotional. They want to talk about the morality of who's right in conflicts like this. Um, colonialism. Yeah. Gets people feeling all sorts of ways. Let me just say that I feel that kind of everyone is right. In this conflict, like from the American perspective, you have all these settlements and Indians are coming over in the middle of the night and they are indiscriminately murdering men, women, children, they're raping, they're killing people in horrible, torturous ways. And so of course you sympathize with these poor American settlers, most of whom are poor, who are just trying to scratch out a living on the American frontier. And then at the same time, from the Indian perspective, they are 100 percent correct. As soon as these colonists settle this region, it's going to lead to their expulsion, which does eventually happen. And so what they're doing, which is burning and destroying these settlements, is the only thing they could do to delay that process by", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/george-washington", "title": "George Washington", "chunk_index": 13, "publication_date": "2024-05-03", "total_chunks_in_doc": 96}}

And so what they ' re doing , which is burning and destroying these settlements , is the only thing they could do to delay that process by George Washington: any period of time. And so to be honest, I sympathize with everyone involved. Everyone is right from their perspective. Obviously you can get deeper into it than that, but I'll leave it there. So, Washington is kept in charge of the Virginia troops, with the charge to go stop all of this conflict to the extent that he can. The problem is he can't stop it. He has very few troops, and they're hundreds of miles. The problem is he can't stop it. He has very few troops, and hundreds of miles of frontier that he's supposed to be protecting. And Indians can just attack wherever they want, they don't have to hold any territory. They just attack, kill, burn, and then they can melt back into the woods. So Washington sets about building forts, raising local militias and defending sellers wherever he can. And he's doing an okay job. He's delaying and he's doing an okay job. You know, he's delaying them a little bit. He's saving some lives. Uh, but the fact of the matter is they are slowly losing the frontier to the French and Indians. And so eventually the British say, okay, we need to send in some professionals here to help the situation's getting out of control. So they send some British regular troops and some British commanders, the regular British army from England to come help take care of this situation. And so Washington says, great. I didn't want to be in charge anyway. I'm excited to serve under someone and learn from him. And so the British general that is sent, his name is Braddock, and they actually get along really well. Washington does not mind being replaced, he wants to be replaced, and he's eager to learn from Braddock as much as he can. They have a great relationship. And so Braddock comes and he says, The problem here is the French. It's the French who are arming the Indians, they're uniting them, coordinating them, so we need to clear out all these French troops, and especially take their base of operations, which is at a place called Fort Duquesne. And so there's our mission, take Fort Duquesne. And like I said, this is wilderness frontier area. It's heavily wooded. So they actually need to cut a road to Fort Duquesne.

And so they slowly start building this road and they eventually realized George Washington: that they are not going to be able to build it all the way to Fort Duquesne. in time before winter sets in. Fort Duquesne, by the way, is located in what is today Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. So they're not going to make it and they decide to forget the road for the last little bit. They're just going to travel light and make a lightning attack on Fort Duquesne. So the journey through the woods goes fairly well. They're very anxious the entire time, looking for French and Indian snipers. Eventually, they're less than a mile from the fort, and they think, Great, we're almost there. When all of a sudden, Washington looks up to see scouts sprinting toward them. When all of a sudden, Washington looks up to see his vanguard, his scouts, sprinting toward him and screaming. Flexner writes about what happens next. üìç Bullets filled the air, striking particularly the officers who towered conspicuous on horseback as they rode in circles, hitting the men with the flats of their swords. Washington's horse sank under him. He leapt clear. As a riderless whore reared by, he caught it and sprang up again. A strange yank on Washington's coat made him look down. There were bullet gashes in it. He pushed his way to Braddock, whose normally red face was brick colored, and whose voice was hoarse from shouting. Having finally caught the distraught general's attention, Washington offered to head the provincials and engage the enemy in their own way. But Braddock refused. Braddock fell wounded from his horse, as did Orm and another of his aides. Washington's second horse faded away from under him, and his hat was carried off by a bullet. So, so, as you can hear, the British are being slaughtered. They are a conventional fighting force, tightly grouped, that is surrounded by a guerrilla force of fighters behind it. They are a conventional fighting force, tightly grouped, that is surrounded by a guerrilla force of fighters hiding behind trees. So they're trying to fire back, but it's like they're firing into the abyss. They can't see anyone, let alone hit them. As Flexner mentioned, the officers are the first to go because they're so conspicuous on their horses. And so actually all the officers who outrank Washington are shot and either wounded or killed, including Braddock, who sinks into a coma. It's Washington himself who leads the retreat and saves at least some", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/george-washington", "title": "George Washington", "chunk_index": 15, "publication_date": "2024-05-03", "total_chunks_in_doc": 96}}

It ' s Washington himself who leads the retreat and saves at least some George Washington: of the men. You know, this battle sounds again like something out of a horror movie. There's no enemy, just the dark forest and death. And it was like a horror movie to Braddock. So, he is shot and falls into a coma. Washington gets him out in the retreat. And when Braddock wakes up, he thinks he's still in a horror movie. Flexner says, quote, He proved to have one ruling thought. To get out of the forest. He ordered that everything which could not immediately be moved be destroyed. Irreplaceable ammunition detonated, wagons burned, cannons smashed. Then the whole army set out passionately for civilization. So in other words, he wakes up from his coma and he's like, Let's just get the freak out of this haunted death forest as quickly as we can. So, in other words, he wakes up and he says, Let's get out of this haunted death forest as quickly as we possibly can. Now, despite being a part of this total disaster of an attack, Washington's reputation actually improves. He becomes known as a war hero in the British colonies, and that's for two reasons. One, he's a hero. Is his physical bravery. You know, all these men tell these stories of Washington riding around on his horse, having multiple horses shot out from under him and just getting a new one. Every time his coat, his coat is shot through his hat is shot through and somehow his coat is shot through his hat is shot through and somehow he survives. His coat is shot through, his hat is shot through, and yet somehow he survives untouched. And so it seems like this man is touched by God. And the other thing is, you may have caught this, uh, in the passage that I read, Braddock is marching like a regular army, he keeps the men clumped together, like a classic European fighting force, and George Washington actually says, Give me my men and let us fight them in this guerrilla way. You know, let us go in the trees and do what they're doing. You know, fight fire with fire. And Braddock says no. And so it was recognized that Washington had the better and smarter strategy and that he was kind of stymied by the rigid British way of fighting. , Everybody seems willing to venture under your command.

A minister wondered from the pulpit, whether Providence had not preserved the heroic youth in so signal a manner because he was destined for some important service of his country. Even regular soldiers praised him, Mr. Washington. Even regular soldiers praised him. Mr. Washington, his friend Orm wrote, had two horses shot under him and his clothes shot through in several places, behaving the whole time with the greatest courage and resolution. And there's another good quote that I think sums up what he was able to accomplish throughout his, and there's another quote that I think sums up what he was able to accomplish, what showed that he was a good leader while he led the troops from Virginia, even though. He was often leading them in defeat. It says, brashness, greenness. All the concomitants of inexperience may be outgrown. And Washington had exhibited to a superlative degree, a quality that is inborn, the ability to lead men. As the war unrolled, the colonial soldiers hardly trained at all and members of no continuing establishment displayed a dismaying tendency to flee from their own shadows. His soldiers marched into the howling forests and, although badly supplied and often unpaid, built roads, fought a superior force, and died under his orders. So in other words, you're like, yeah, maybe that's a low bar, right? But the conditions are horrible. I want you to imagine, put yourself in George Washington's position. There's no colonial army. These are not professional troops. They've never been drilled. They have not been trained. Most of them come with little or no supplies. Some of them don't even have guns and they're not under military discipline. So if they don't like what George Washington has to say, they can just go home. And if they don't want to fight in this battle, they can not fight in this battle. He has no power of capital punishment. He can't punish desertion. It's not. A real army. And despite these circumstances, it's not a real army. And despite these circumstances unique to everyone in the British colonies, he alone is able to get people to fight and die for him, which is an accomplish in.

He ' s able to do something to stem George Washington: the tide of these Indian attacks. It might not be much, but he's the only one doing anything. And he shows leadership and bravery, even in the midst of these defeats. And so he's a military hero in part, because he's one of the only people, one of the very, very, very few people who has accomplished anything in this frontier fighting. And so after these disasters, he's still in charge of the Virginia troops. And he says, look. We need to reform some things around here. And he sets about trying to turn the Virginia Militia into an actual professional fighting force. And so it's worth looking at what his approach was to this. How does he do it? How does he lead? When he's finally given the kind of tools that he wants and needs in order to form an actual professional fighting force, the first thing he does, He is professionalized. So, so one of his contemporaries writes method and exactness are the forte of his character. And so that was the first thing method and exactness drill the troops, get the details down. Another thing is he's very good at finding and maintaining talent. So he has this really big emphasis on merit, and this is a time, and this is at a time when much of the British Army based their promotions on connections. Whose son are you? Who do you know? Who's willing to vouch for you? You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours. And Washington, on the other hand, had a big focus on merit, on ability. I shall make it, Washington announced, the most agreeable part of my duty to study merit and reward the brave and deserving. I assure you, gentlemen, that partiality shall never bias my conduct, nor shall prejudice injure any. But throughout the whole tenor of my proceedings, I shall endeavor, as far as I am able, to reward and punish without the least diminution. To reward and punish without the least diminution. Another thing he does that is a hallmark of great leaders, from Steve Jobs to Napoleon, is that he tends to reward and praise the unit. Not the individual. So mostly he takes the blame or the credit for himself, but when there is stuff to merit it out, when there is special recognition to be had either positive or negative, he gives it to the unit.

{"text": "when there is stuff to merit it out , when there is special recognition to be had either positive or negative , he gives it to the unit . So here ' s what Flexner writes . When reporting to his superiors , he usually did not eulogize or blame George Washington: his subordinates unless he wished what he said to lead specifically to promotion or its opposite. This kept the lines of power within the regiment leading up to Washington as its head. wrote his colonel that he altogether depended on him for protection and was sensible that, as far as justice is on my side, depend on your favor. In his letters to his officers, Washington criticized when he considered that necessary, but rarely included individual praise. From day to day, even in battle, he assumed that each man or detachment would do his best for all, and so, if he phrased a compliment, it was to the regiment as a whole. Pride in the regiment rather than individual pride was what Washington sought to inculcate. Okay. And one other thing to point out there is another thing that is common of great leaders. Which is that typically they're not big on positive reinforcement. They have high expectations. And if you meet them, that is the status quo. If not, you'll be reprimanded and you have to go truly above and beyond to merit praise. And that is an environment that is aggressive and not always easy, but leads to very high performance. Well, despite this professionalization of the Virginia militia, there's just no way that they're going to be able to win this war. And the turning of the tide actually comes with the election of William Pitt. He becomes prime minister back in England and he's very active and he's controlling the grand strategy. And so this turns the tide. He sends a new commander to take over for George Washington. And this new British commander comes in and says, okay, we're going to attack Fort Duquesne again. And we're not going to screw it up this time. He wants to build a new road on a different route to attack Fort Duquesne. And Washington argues very strongly against this. He wants to go back to the Braddock Road and finish building that. And he really stakes his reputation on the idea that this new road is a bad idea and it's going to lead to failure and they should be doing something about it. The road that he had started with Braddock. So what ends up happening is he's overridden. This new general builds the new road. Over the course of months, they get very close to Fort Duquesne. And then once they're close enough to attack, they go to attack and they find that the French have evacuated and burned the fort to the ground.

{"text": "new road . Over the course of months , they get very close to Fort Duquesne . And then once they ' re close enough to attack , they go to attack and they find that the French have evacuated and burned the fort to the ground . George Washington George Washington: is confused. He doesn't understand what happened. You know, he had been ambushed. And had this incredible defense put up against him the last time he had attacked and now they melted away. Like it was nothing. And that's because he didn't understand the grand strategy of what was happening. so as I mentioned, this prime minister, William Pitt, very sharp guy, one of the great prime ministers And he realizes that where George Washington is fighting, the Ohio Valley, is dependent on the Great Lakes region for their supplies and their communications. So the French have their region of Canada, what is now Quebec, and they have some forts up there. And so French supplies, when they come, They come through the Great Lakes and into those forts, and then they make their way down the Allegheny River and the Ohio River to Fort Duquesne. And so he realizes, well, if we just cut off and he realizes, well, we don't have to do all this forest fighting. If we just use our superior Navy and cut them off in this Great Lakes region, they're not going to be able to get supplies and communications down to Fort Duquesne and they're going to be forced to leave. So that's exactly what happens. They cut off communications, they cut off supplies. That's why. When they build this new road and the French see them coming, they just take off before they even find a battle. They are low on food, they're low on supplies, and they have no communication so they don't know what's happening, so they don't want to stick around and fight. Now, look, Washington might have been right. You know, concerning the two roads, maybe the Braddock Road was way better than the new road they built, and if the French actually had been able to stand and fight, it would have gone horribly for the British. That doesn't really matter. He's got egg on his face. It doesn't really matter that it's, you know, for a reason that has nothing to do with him. Uh, it's still just embarrassing. Flexner writes, To civilian life with bitterness, resentful of injustice, stung with a sense of unmerited failure. He was not to serve again in any military capacity for 17 years. Okay?

{"text": "of injustice , stung with a sense of unmerited failure . He was not to serve again in any military capacity for 17 years . Okay ? And that was something I didn ' t realize going in that George Washington was only a soldier for five years , and George Washington: then there's a 17 year gap on his resume before he comes back. But in the meantime, he goes back to Mount Vernon, which is his estate, and he lives the life of a country gentleman, farmer. And he's quite good. He's good socially, he's good politically, and he's good at just the business side of farming. He uses powers of observation and extensive, he uses powers of observation and extensive record keeping and experimentation, and experimentation to improve his yield. He has a fairly simple, but very analytical approach. So So for example, John Hancock, who you may have heard of, so for example, one visitor visits him at Mount Vernon, for example, one visitor to Mount Vernon talks about his operations and says, everything he does is by method of system. He keeps a journal where he records everything. He is a model of the highest perfection. So what does it actually mean? So what does it actually mean? So for example, he takes soil from six different parts of his estate, you know, up on the hills, down in the valleys, over here, over there, uh, different, different corners, different areas. And he pots them all. And then he plants four different kinds of crops. In all these different soils. And then he observes them to see what grows best where. So, you know, maybe hay grows really well in this soil and tobacco grows really well in this soil. And corn grows really well in this soil. And so then he shuffles where he's growing, what based on what responds best to, to certain soils. So that gives you an idea of the type of analysis that he's doing to make sure he's getting the best yield. He lives a quite simple, but very disciplined life. Here's what Chernow writes about his routine. He said Washington benefited from the un varying regularity of his daily routine and found nothing monotonous about it. Like many thrifty farmers, he rose before sunrise and accomplished much of his work while others still slept. Prior to breakfast, he shuffled about in dressing gown and slippers and passed an hour or two in his library reading and handling correspondence. He also devoted time to private prayers before Billy Lee, that's one of his slaves, laid out his clothes, brushed his hair, and tied it in a queue. Washington liked to examine his stables before breakfast, inspect his horses, and issue instructions to the grooms.

So Washington. So Washington, he's really analytical, but one thing that he can't wrap his mind around is the price that is paid for his tobacco. And that's because he has a single buyer. So you have the single merchant from England who comes to basically all the tobacco growers in Virginia. And they sail up these rivers and they basically can dictate to the Virginians what price they are going to buy the tobacco at. It's classic, it's classic power laws stuff. And so George Washington is not happy with this at all. He's always writing to them being like, why is it this amount? I feel like I'm not getting paid enough. And they have cornered the, but they have all the market information. So there's not really anything he can do. And rather than accepting this, George Washington says, And rather than accepting this George Washington, and rather than accepting this, George Washington says, you know what, I'm going to try something different. I'm going to experiment with different crops. And so he starts growing wheat and corn. And one of the reasons that that's good is because he can sell to local buyers. And so he's able to, um, and so he's able to see where prices are at, what people are buying for why the prices are what they are.

Basically every farmer wasn't that you read about these really wealthy Virginians, even people like Thomas Jefferson are just chronically in debt to British lenders and Washington was on that path as well. You know, he comes back from the army, he starts farming, he's going deeper and deeper into debt to the British banks until he says, no, I'm going to keep until he says, no, I'm going to try this new strategy, start selling locally. Wheat and corn. And then his debt gets reduced year over year, every single year, as he's able to create this really profitable farm. So he's a grant, so he's acquiring more and more land because of this profitability and because he also makes a very intelligent and he's able to acquire a lot more land when he makes a great decision and he gets married to a very wealthy widow. Named Martha. She had this huge estate that she had inherited from her now deceased husband. And look, that was a happy coincidence. He didn't marry her for her money necessarily. He loved her. They got along really well. It was a great and pretty interesting partnership and marriage, but yes. Um, so whereas his previous companion was basically his mom who always tried to cut him down to size, uh, Martha was very supportive, very loving. They had a very intimate relationship. And she's also a really great partner for his social ambitions. She's a great hostess. And they love to host. They're very social. They always have people over for dinner.

He was congenial without being deeply personal , friendly , without being familiar . and perfected a cool sociability that distanced George Washington: him from people even as it invited them closer. He never felt the urge to impress people. As John Marshall wrote, he had no pretensions to the vivacity which fascinates and to the wit which dazzles. He knew the value of silence, largely kept opinions to himself, and seldom committed a faux pas. Okay, so he is still friendly, but now he's kind of reserved as well. He doesn't disclose more than is necessary. Um, Chernow also writes later, quote, His reserve, if not impenetrable, was by no means lightly surrendered. He was habitually cautious with new people and only gradually opened up as they passed a series of loyalty tests. Be courteous to all, be courteous to all, but intimate with few, he advised his nephew, and let those few be well tried before you give them your confidence. True friendship, true friendship is a plant, true friendship is a plant of slow growth because Washington never invited, true friendship, true friendship is a plant of slow growth, he said. Because Washington never invited people readily into his confidence, it had a nearly irresistible appeal when he did. So he uses this popularity and these social connections to create a political career. So he joins the House of Burgess, which is the lower house, of the Virginia Parliament, essentially the House of Representatives or the House of Commons in the American or British system. His approach is to only speak on important matters. His approach is to only speak on important matters. So often he doesn't even show up for debates or voting on matters. He only shows up and speaks out on things that he thinks are critical. Uh, he revealed his attitude about this in advice he gave to his nephew in 1787. He wrote, speak seldom, but to important subjects, except such as particularly relate to your constituents. And in the former case, make yourself perfectly master of the subject. Never exceed a decent warmth and submit your sentiments with diffidence. A dictatorial style, though it may carry conviction, is always accompanied with disgust. Okay, so I like that approach. Speak simply and powerfully about Only important topics. And that way people get used to taking what you have to say very seriously. Chernow writes, there was a gravitas about the young Washington, a seriousness of purpose and a fierce determination to succeed that made him stand out in any crowd. And I liked that description.

I actually think that word seriousness really captures one of the things that made Washington so significant . There ' s this great George Washington: essay, uh, by, uh, uh, entrepreneur. There's a great essay by an investor named Catherine Boyle that I really like. There's an essay by an investor named Catherine Boyle that I really like. It's called On Seriousness. And she says that something that we lack in today's day and age is seriousness. Uh, here's a quote from her article. She says, seriousness is the maniacal belief in a project greater than oneself. It's anchored by a type of sacrifice and solemnity that went out of vogue in the United States at the end of the second world war. If you're pinpointing a time when America became less serious, it's around the same time when America began sacrificing communal responsibility in favor of individual pursuits. Though it's unfair to pin everything on the boomers, the concept of finding oneself did not exist during the German Blitz. She goes on to identify irony as the antithesis of seriousness. I don't think irony was as much a concern during Washington's time. For him, the antithesis probably would have been something more like frivolity. Regardless, irony is what we have to worry about today. And I like this quote that Catherine Boyle gives from David Foster Wallace. This is great. Listen to this. Irony and cynicism were just what the U. S. hypocrisy of the 50s and 60s called for. That's what made the early postmodernists great artists. The great thing about irony is that it splits things apart, gets up above them so we can see the flaws in hypocrisies and duplicates. The virtuous always triumph? Ward Cleaver is the prototypical fifties father? Sure. Sarcasm, parody, absurdism Sarcasm, parody, absurdism, and irony are great ways to strip off stuff's mask and show the unpleasant reality behind it. The problem is that once the rules of art are debunked and once the unpleasant realities and once the unpleasant realities the irony diagnoses are revealed and diagnosed, then what do we do? Irony's useful for debunking Irony's debunking illusions But most of the illusion debunking in the US has been done and redone Once everybody knows that equality of opportunity is bunk And Mike Brady is bunk Once everybody knows that equal opportunity is bunk And Mike Brady of opportunity is bunk And Mike Brady is bunk And just say no is bunk Now what do we do?

Postmodern irony and cynicism becomes an end in itself , a measure of hip sophistication and literary George Washington: savvy. Few artists dare to try to talk about ways of working towards redeeming what's wrong, because they'll look sentimental and na√Øve all to because they'll look sentimental and na√Øve to all the weary ironists. Irony's gone from liberating to enslaving. There's some great essay somewhere that has a line about irony being the song of the prisoner who's come to love his cage. Okay, so, I think that's another great lesson from Washington. He was serious. He was serious about his commitment to the United States. He was sincere about his He was sincere about his desire to serve his fellow citizens. He was sincere in his military service. Even in an age that was sincere. He was particularly sincere and earnest. One other thing to talk about is George Washington's philosophy and religious beliefs, which he was developing a lot during this period of time, people often refer to George Washington as a deist and a deist is someone who believes that there was a God who created the universe, but that he doesn't interfere in human affairs. And I think that's kind of accurate, but George Washington was not a committed deist In the way to say Thomas Jefferson was like Thomas Jefferson really got deep into the philosophy and he rejected the divinity of Jesus Christ. I don't think George Washington really rejected these religious ideas so much as he just didn't care. Like he was a man of action and it just wasn't interesting to him. Um, there's a great quote. Someone had sent him a sermon and said that it was extraordinary and he should read it and he sent it to someone else. And here's what he said. I presume it is good coming all the way from New Hampshire, but do not vouch for it. Not having read a word of it myself. So like, um, you know, he went to, he, he believed in church as a social practice. He didn't go to church any more than was strictly necessary for him. He was just very practical and I don't think he thought much about this stuff. Flexner writes, quote, in 1793, Washington thus summarized the religious philosophy he was evolving during his Mount Vernon years.

We may safely trust the issue to him without perplexed . without perplexing ourselves to seek for that which is beyond human ken , only taking care to perform George Washington: the parts assigned to us in a way that reason and our own consciences approve of. So those were his religious beliefs. In terms of his philosophy, he had this Stoic detachment, this acceptance of fate. He called it Providence. And actually, his philosophy was very similar to that of Napoleon Bonaparte. Both were extremely brave. Both had this stoic, laconic acceptance of whatever happened. Whatever happened was the will of destiny for Napoleon and of providence for Washington. They used the two different words in almost exactly the same way and it created the same effect, the same philosophical outlook. You know, somewhat paradoxically, this acceptance of providence or destiny in both cases did not lead either man to be resigned to events, but to be extremely active. I think that sort of Zen acceptance of events combined with that determination to do everything in one's power within the course of that cosmic or divine will leads to very powerful outcomes. I just think that's so interesting that they saw it the same way that there is this great, that there's this great Providence, this great destiny and, and that we can't control it, and we should accept it. Within that context, we should do everything that we can to make sure that we are performing our part admirably. Within that philosophy, Washington wrote, It is assuredly better to go laughing than crying through the rough journey of life. And so, again, I think that describes this sort of detachment, right? Of, it's a rough journey, there's not too much we can do about it, but you have to go through it anyway, so you might as well laugh. Okay, so that is Washington's development as a Okay. So that was Washington's development as a country gentleman. Wow. So for 17 years, that is Washington's course. He is a gentleman farmer. He is extremely successful. He's renowned. He's well known. He's well liked, but his life has no particular course. It doesn't seem like he's destined for anything earth shaking. And then in the early 1770s, you start to hear rumblings of revolution. I won't tell you the full history of the American revolution, but this essentially starts because of some taxes that the British were imposing. It's funny, they were actually lowering their taxes, but the taxes were so widely flouted. The Americans were paying essentially zero in taxes.

The Americans were paying essentially zero in taxes . They were just , uh , they were George Washington: smugglers. They weren't paying any of this stuff. And so the British government said, look. We're going to lower these taxes, but we're going to step up enforcement a ton, and you guys are going to actually have to start paying. And so this makes the Americans mad because it is effectively a tax raise. And also it starts to get them thinking, well, how come we don't get a vote on any of this? How come parliament gets to vote? What happens to us? It gets the rallying cry of taxation without representation, which people don't like. And so anyways. This revolutionary fervor starts to develop. Now, Washington's natural disposition was to be pro British. Remember, he's mixed up with the Fairfaxes and their claim to, remember, he's mixed up with the Fairfaxes. They're good friends of his and their claim to all this land in Virginia was based on royal decree and was opposed. By many locals. Uh, so he has his lot kind of in with the Fairfax's. so he's got a natural disposition to be, so he's got a natural disposition to be pro British for that reason. He had also served in the British army and had lobbied hard to be a part of, you know, not just the Virginia militia, but to be considered an actual British soldier. So for those reasons, You know, he, he should be a loyalist you would think, but he actually goes along with the revolution. he hesitates to make up his mind at first, but there is another local farmer who he's friends with named George Mason. And he has these conversations with George Mason and that does a lot to persuade him to the revolutionary side. And so one of the first things he does that shows his pro independence turn is that he and George Mason together. Draw up a proposal for a sort of boycott of British goods as some of this stuff is happening and they propose it to the Virginia legislature and it is adopted. It doesn't really work out. It wasn't super well designed. Boycotts are always hard to carry out. Um, it shows signs that he's thinking about this stuff and he's willing to put his name toward the cause of independence.

It was really Massachusetts that kind of dragged the rest of the colonies into this revolution . It was New England in general , but especially Massachusetts was the center George Washington: of revolutionary foment. And so there start to be serious conflicts between Massachusetts and New England. And British soldiers, and this really starts to heat up. So they call together a continental Congress. So they asked for representatives from every colony to form this little Congress to talk about, okay, what are we going to do? How are we going to respond to British aggression? What are our demands? You know, how are we going to navigate this diplomatic crisis? At first, this Congress is not called together specifically for declaring independence. But they just want to figure out what to do. And, uh, as they get together, things. Go even further downhill in Massachusetts. And now you have a actual, as they meet in this continental Congress, things continue to go downhill in Massachusetts. And now for the first time, you're starting to have actual battles between British forces and kind of locally organized militias. And so everyone can kind of see, uh, we need some sort of force. Remember there is no declaration of independence yet. This is actually more than a year off. They realize They would prefer still a negotiated settlement. Most people in the Continental Congress would still prefer a negotiated settlement if they can come to one. But in the meantime, they need to prepare for independence. And then as the situation deteriorates, they realize, Okay. Actually, it's more than likely that we're going to have to fight that we're going to have to declare independence. And so. These forces are going to be really important. Washington is elected to the continental Congress is a member there and does not want to be commander in chief of these forces. He says, no desire or insinuation of mine. So Chernow writes, no desire or insinuation of mind. So Chernow writes, no desire or insinuation of mine. Washington was to write, drew the command his way. Indeed, he seems actively to have tried to avoid the command, inducing his friend and fellow Virginia delegate, Isaac Pemberton to argue publicly for another candidate. Despite the fact that Washington is actively lobbying not to be the commander in chief of continental troops, he is in fact elected commander in chief. He's elected because he's the only one.

And so they have to offer some concessions to the Southerners if they want them to come along . And so one of those George Washington: things is, hey, let's let a Southerner lead this army. And also Washington, you know, the fact that he didn't want it and he had this impartiality made him really attractive. To a lot of people, you know, there's actually another consideration, which was the wealthiest people in the colonies did not want independence and we're not on board with this movement. And that actually disturbed a lot of members of the continental Congress. They wanted this to be, you know, not a rabble rousing, you know, low class revolution. They wanted this to be something that United all Americans. And so there was really concern that the wealthiest Americans were not on board with this revolution. Now, George Washington was very wealthy and somehow his wealth got kind of exaggerated at the Continental Congress. There were rumors flying that he was the wealthiest man in Virginia. That was not true, but he was very wealthy. And so they thought also they love, and so they love George Washington for that reason too. That he was a sign that, look, we're We can get some of these very wealthiest people in America to support the revolution as well. And so, you know, there's just a mix of factors. People loved George Washington, and so it starts to become clear he's the guy. And so on the actual day, here's what happens. Quote, Washington, who knew what was likely to take place, stayed away. Probably he sat alone in his lodgings. His name, so Adams believed, was put in nomination by Thomas Johnson of Maryland. The official minute reads, Resolved that a general to be appointed The official minutes read, Resolved that a general be appointed to command all the continental forces raised or to be raised for the defense of American liberty. That 500 a month be allowed for his pay and expenses, the Congress then proceeded to the choice of a general by ballot, when George Washington Esquire was unanimously selected. In all history, In all history, no general had ever been more strangely and momentously commissioned. Far from stepping to the head of a constituted force, the commander in chief was the only man, no rifleman having yet been enlisted, actually to be enrolled in the Continental Army.

Not by any direct vote or broad decision had Congress brought the 13 colonies into the war then , being waged in New England . But George Washington: by the act of elevating Washington, there was no nation to fight for. The Declaration of Independence lay more than a year in the future. There was, except for intangibles, grievances and resented atrocities, Only Washington. I think that is an amazing fact. Just imagine that there was no army, there was no nation, there was no constitution, there was no declaration of independence, there was nothing. There was only George Washington and an army to come. And so for a üìç time, George Washington stood alone against the greatest empire on the earth. Chernow writes of, Chernow writes of this moment, George Washington was already becoming more than a mere man. He was the face and form of an amorphous cause. As Gary Willis has noted, Before there was a nation, before there was any symbol of that nation, a flag, a constitution, a national seal, there was Washington. Washington is somewhat horrified. That he has been elected to this position. He's not sure that he can do it. He's not sure what the future will. He's not sure that he can do it. He's not sure what the future will bring. He wrote to a friend Burwell Bassett. I can answer for about three things. He wrote to a friend Burwell Bassett.

So, tune in next time to hear about the coming storm, the revolution, and George Washington's presidency after, spoiler alert, America wins. But before we go, a few takeaways. Uh, just a few reminders of things that we talked about. Number one, be a serious person. Take yourself seriously. Believe in something. Don't mask everything with irony. Have the courage to be sincere. Number two, decisiveness and speed. Those are hallmarks of Washington's approach. Number three, you have to understand the broader context of what you are involved in.

Welcome to part two. On the life of George Washington, the American president, the American general statesman, and the first president of the United States of America. So far in part one, this is an interesting story about a guy who has achieved some success, but he is far away from being one of the most famous men of all time. In this episode, we are going to explore the revolutionary war, his leadership there, why it was so vital and how he was able to so successfully. In this episode, we're going to explore the revolutionary war. So that's when the United States declares independence from great Britain, his leadership in that war, why it was so vital and how he was able to be so successful, despite being a pretty mediocre battlefield general. One of the things that I think is so powerful is when you identify great, really successful people who were bad at certain things. And not just anything, but things that were core to what they were trying to do. So for example, Demosthenes is known as one of the greatest speakers of all time. He, he lived in ancient Greece and he had a horrible speech impediment. Okay. So here you have someone who was the greatest speech giver of all time, who was physically bad at speaking. And so that means that there is something incredibly valuable that you can learn from Demosthenes because you learn what is actually valuable in the pursuit of something and what is not. So if I'm giving you a sports analogy to this, LeBron James, he's a little bit older now, but let's wind back the clock 10 years, 2014 and LeBron James is the strongest player in the NBA. He's one of the fastest players in the NBA. He's also one of the best passers, one of the best rebounders, one of the best on ball defenders. One of the smartest players in the NBA. And so it's incredibly difficult to know what to focus on, what to learn from his career, because he's so good at everything. It's hard to differentiate because he's so good at everything. It's hard to differentiate what matters the most from what is dispensable.

{"text": "focus on , what to learn from his career , because he ' s so good at everything . It ' s hard to differentiate because he ' s so good at everything . It ' s hard to differentiate what matters the most from what is dispensable . Tim George Washington: Ferriss, the famous author and podcaster has a good phrase for this. He says, you generally. When you're talking to coaches, you don't want to talk to the most successful coaches in any given field. You can't learn as much from them because they usually get the best athletes. And so oftentimes, they never learn to actually be an extraordinary coach. They never learn to develop talent in an extraordinary way. Because they're doing what Tim calls babysitting mutants. Okay. They aren't developing talent. They are just getting the most successful people, mutants, like people who are so genetically predisposed to be great at a sport. They just have to babysit them. They just have to make sure they're okay. They get them to play for them, the best coach. And I think that's a really interesting point. He likes to talk to the second most successful coaches because they get athletes who are very gifted, but who they actually have to develop. And so they learn to develop skills and they're actually good at coaching. So all that is to say, I think you can learn a lot from people who are very successful, but who have a very obvious fatal flaw. And that is very true of George Washington. He's one of the greatest generals of all time, despite being pretty bad. On the battlefield, or at least not excellent. He's like the Mastinese. How do you become a great speaker despite literally being bad at speaking? How do you become a great general despite not being very good at commanding troops?

So we left last episode and George Washington has been appointed the commander in chief of American forces without any real forces. Now, what you do have is you already have some militiamen. In New England, New England is the Northern part of the United States. And these militiamen are fighting the British around Boston. So he's put in command of these forces and then some other militias are raised from the other colonies as well to support. Now, one of the first things he does is interesting. You know, he's one of those people who argued for a boycott of British goods, but that doesn't mean a total end. Commercial relations with Britain. Listen to what Churnow writes. He says remarkably in this fierce letter He argued that the colonists should refrain from purchasing British imports But not renege on paying debts owed to British creditors for I think whilst we are accusing others of injustice We should be just ourselves.

He says remarkably in this fierce letter He argued that the colonists should refrain from purchasing British imports But not renege on paying debts owed to British creditors for I think whilst we are accusing others of injustice We should be just ourselves . He said George Washington: It was this steadfast sense of fairness, even at the most feverish political moments, that set George Washington apart. Alright, I think that's really interesting. George Washington really wants to do things the right way. And it reminds me a lot of Julius Caesar. If you go back and listen to, uh, The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World, it's a recent episode, I talk a lot about Caesar's clemency. So he's involved in the civil war, much like George Washington. And he has this policy of forgiving people, of not executing them, not taking their stuff. Uh, he says, I'm the rightful ruler and I'm just trying to set everything right. So there's going to be no retribution. I'm going to be very clement, very forgiving, and we're all going to go on our merry way with me as the leader. He wants to do things like George Washington, the right way. He's sort of the law and order, peace and stability candidate from the beginning. And that makes his job more difficult. In the short term, but it makes him a more attractive option in the long run. And his contemporary Cicero has this quote that I love. He says Caesar's treacherous and his contemporary Cicero, who was opposed to him in the civil war, has this great quote that I love. He says, Caesar's treacherous clemency, enchants them. Okay. And by doing things the right way, it really does have this enchanting effect. Uh, it pulls people into your orbit because they see you as more than a partisan in a conflict, but as someone who is kind of above it all. Yeah. As someone who sees beyond the conflict and that was George. He was always trying to take the high road. Here's another example. Great story. Here's, here's another quote. It says, if any officer or soldier shall presume to strike, imprison, or otherwise ill treat any of the inhabitants, And that was George. He was always trying to take the high road. Uh, there's another example of how he does this. A lot of people want to, there's another example of when he does this, a lot of people want to just take the stuff of the loyalists, the Tories, the people who wanted to remain loyal to the crown.

{"text": "another example of when he does this , a lot of people want to just take the stuff of the loyalists , the Tories , the people who wanted to remain loyal to the crown . You know , there ' s a lot of revolutionaries who are like , George Washington: well, these people aren't on our side. Let's take their stuff. And here's what Washington says. If any officer or so, If any officer or soldier shall presume to strike, imprison, or otherwise ill treat any of the inhabitants, they may depend on being punished with the utmost severity, he announced. In a beautiful symbolic act, he returned a horse given to him after learning that he had been That it had been swiped from a departed Tory who had been an avowed enemy to the American cause. actions, , Washington shaped the tone and character of the American army. Okay, so as you can imagine, he's losing out on cheap victories. There's a lot of stuff to be taken. And okay. okay. So as you can imagine, he's losing out on a lot of cheap victories this way, but there are a lot of long term benefits to doing things the right way. You develop trust, you excite the imagination. People want to be a part of what you're doing. In fact, he goes so far. Um, later there's a statue of King George. And people behead it and they melt it down and they use the metal from the statue, it's in New York, to create musket balls for the Continental Army. And Washington, instead of saying, hey, thank you for the ammunition, is very disturbed by this and condemns it. So just imagine that. It's a purely symbolic object, it's doing nothing, that demonstrates support for the enemy. And it is destroyed in order to create much needed Resources for your army and Washington vehemently opposes this because it was so important for him to do things the right way. So that is one of my big takeaways from Washington. It is worth it to do things the right way from the very beginning, even when it might be convenient and you might score cheap victories by, by doing things the easy way. So he's trying to do things the right way. If you remember from last episode, He's actually initially open to peace and a lot of people in the colonies are open to peace They're thinking this is kind of a conflict to show that we're serious Hopefully to convince the king to give us some of the rights that we're asking for and hopefully this can all be negotiated But in late 1775 and early 1776 three things happen that change that the first is in southern Virginia the British attack and And", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/george-washington", "title": "George Washington", "chunk_index": 38, "publication_date": "2024-05-03", "total_chunks_in_doc": 96}}
{"text": "serious Hopefully to convince the king to give us some of the rights that we ' re asking for and hopefully this can all be negotiated But in late 1775 and early 1776 three things happen that change that the first is in southern Virginia the British attack and And George Washington: torch completely destroy the city of Norfolk. And this really outraged people. The second thing is that in early 1776, King George gives a speech stating his absolute contempt for the American cause that it must be crushed. So then the Americans had been holding out the hope that this whole conflict was caused by parliament. By an overactive parliament, but Hey, the King, when he realizes what's going on, he's going to side with us and this will all get sorted out. And King George comes out and says, that is not the case. I'm with parliament. So that's strike two. And then the third thing is that Thomas Paine writes a very persuasive pamphlet called common sense, and it is very effective at persuading people that independence is necessary. So these three things happen in quick succession. And so by early 1776, Most people in the American colonies believe in independence and support the cause of separating from Great Britain. And this starts everyone down the path that would lead to the Declaration of Independence in July of 1776. One thing that George Washington is also very proud of, One thing George Washington is also very passionate about is intelligence. He has this thirst for learning more. He's a great spy master. He is immediately cultivating spies wherever he can to spy on the British troops who are initially in Boston. And of course he needs to keep secrets. He's trying to keep as much information as he can from the British. You also might be interested in keeping your data and your secrets secret from everyone else.

So Washington takes command of the troops, uh, in and around Boston in late. Okay. So George Washington takes command of the troops in and around Boston in 1775. And initially some of these troops don't like him. Uh, the American identity had not really been developed yet. And so these new Englanders consider themselves. Somewhat different from Southerners from people like George Washington who's from Virginia, which is a southern colony And so they give him a little bit of a hard time So he really has to ingratiate himself to the men and get them to buy into his leadership So he does this in a few ways. One is a theme I'll return to from the first episode which is physicality It helps to be jacked. This is something I'll return to again and again because it really helps George Washington, you don't have to be physically impressive to be great, but it helps is definitely one path to get there. You know, Arnold Schwarzenegger talks about this. He has this great quote. He says, uh, once he starts weightlifting and getting really big, he said, before long people began looking at me as a special person. I was growing, getting bigger, gaining confidence. I was given consideration I had never received before. It was as though I was the son of a millionaire. I'd walk into a room at school and my classmates would offer me food. Or ask if they could help me with my homework. Even my teachers treated me differently. Okay, so people are treating him differently. And you hear this all the time with George Washington. So, uh, one contemporary writes, people were transfixed by Washington's lean, virile presence. Okay, I love that. People are just transfixed by the way he looks. Here's another quote, um, This one's from Chernow. Washington had the inestimable Washington had the inestimable advantage of looking the part of a military leader. As Benjamin Rush stated, he had so much martial dignity in his deportment that you would distinguish him to be a general and a soldier from among 10, 000 people. There is not a king in Europe that would not look like a valet de chambre by his side. And his com Okay, and as Benjamin Rush is hinting at, it's not", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/george-washington", "title": "George Washington", "chunk_index": 40, "publication_date": "2024-05-03", "total_chunks_in_doc": 96}}
{"text": "be a general and a soldier from among 10 , 000 people . There is not a king in Europe that would not look like a valet de chambre by his side . And his com Okay , and as Benjamin Rush is hinting at , it ' s not George Washington: just how he looks, it's how he acts. So again, sure now. Henry Knox stood in awe of Washington's panache. George Washington fills his place with vast ease and dignity and dispenses happiness around him. An enthusiastic friend reported to John Adams that Washington has in a manner inspired officers and soldiers to with a taste for discipline and they go into it readily as they all venerate and love the general. Okay, so it is both the way he looks, this massive, strong, impressive man, and the way he acts, this upright, dignified, proper, polite, friendly, serious man. One story I like that demonstrates this, the kind of the physicality of greatness, is all these continental forces are coming together in Massachusetts, around Boston, and they're interacting. For the first time and many of them have not met people from some of these far flung colonies and there are a lot of cultural differences and there's kind of cultural whiplash. And uh, so in one incident, a huge brawl breaks out. People are fighting from different states, from different colonies, And And here's how Chernow describes it, quote, A fierce struggle commenced with southern s A fierce Here's how Chernow, uh, describes what happened. A fierce struggle commenced with biting and gouging on the one part, and knockdown on the other part with as much apparent fury as the most deadly enemy could create. Reinforced by their friends in less than five minutes, More than a thousand combatants were on the field, struggling for the mastery. Okay. More than a thousand soldiers in the same army are all punching, gouging, kicking, fighting each other at this juncture, general Washington made his appearance, whether by accident or design. I never knew. I only saw him and his colored servant, Billy Lee, both mounted with the spring of a deer, he leaped from his saddle through the reins of his bridle into the hands of his servant and rushed into the thickest of the melee and rushed into the thickest of the melee and with an iron grip seized to and held them fast. Okay, so he comes in and he physically breaks up a fight of more than a thousand men by going right into the fray and At first he just grabs two men and pulls them apart and he keeps doing this just physically separating the two sides Until everyone calms down and separates so you can see that like with his physical present So you can see that with his physical presence. He is unifying this army One of the other", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/george-washington", "title": "George Washington", "chunk_index": 41, "publication_date": "2024-05-03", "total_chunks_in_doc": 96}}
{"text": "and pulls them apart and he keeps doing this just physically separating the two sides Until everyone calms down and separates so you can see that like with his physical present So you can see that with his physical presence . He is unifying this army One of the other George Washington: things he does, uh, I think maybe it goes back to the idea of doing things the right way is, um, you know, he believes in discipline. He also believes in hygiene. Uh, he wants everyone looking clean, acting clean. So one of the, so one of the most important decisions he makes of the entire war is one that he makes early in the war. Uh, here's the quote by January, 1777, he ordered Dr. William Shippen to inoculate every soldier who had never had smallpox. Authorizes, but seems to require the measure, he wrote, for should the disorder infect the army in the natural way and rage with its usual virulence, We should have more to dread from it than the sword of the enemy. This enlightened decision was as important as any military measure Washington adopted during the war. So he's getting his army in order, both in terms of their discipline and in terms of their hygiene and in terms of their unity, let's get into the action and see what happens. So the first thing that Washington does. Okay. So let's get into the action and see what he actually does. The first thing that he does, I mentioned his thirst for intelligence. The first thing he does is lie through his teeth because he comes into command and he is told that he has 308 barrels of gunpowder, which is comforting to him. That's exactly where they should be at. So he goes and he inspects and he finds that this is completely wrong. They actually have 36, barrels of gunpowder. And this is like catastrophic the British don't know it. They don't know there's this low on gunpowder But if they did know it they could just attack the americans And wipe them out immediately. Um, they just, they don't have the resources to defend themselves, let alone attack the British. And so he lies to everyone. He lies to his enemies. He lies. He lies to his enemies.

He ' s afraid that if he writes to Congress , you know , this is a body Of dozens , I think it ' s maybe a couple hundred men and someone is going to let slip that they ' re in desperate need of George Washington: gunpowder. So he can't just write to the continental con so he can't just write to continental Congress and say, send me more gunpowder. That's going to lead to disaster. So he lies to them and he's lying to the British. He actually lies to his own troops. He says, uh, we have so much gunpowder. I'm embarrassed. I'm embarrassed by the amount of gunpowder we have, but he says, I am regardless instituting, uh, a rule against target practice and the, and unnecessary firing of muskets, uh, just cause it's, it's good practice, right? So he's trying to limit the amount of gunpowder they're using, um, while not giving away the reason that he doesn't want to waste any gunpowder in the meantime, he starts sending around to other forts that Americans own saying, Hey, do you guys have gunpowder doing whatever he can in a secretive. Doing whatever he can in a clandestine way to get more gunpowder. So the crisis passes in about two weeks, he's able to, uh, get all the gunpowder he, he needs, and this is all alleviated when one of his subordinates, um, a guy named Knox, when one of his subordinates, a Lieutenant named Henry Knox, manages this amazing feat of transporting 120, 000 pounds of cannons, mortars, and from a fort in upstate New York where it wasn't needed and he brings it down to Boston, which lays the groundwork for an offensive attack. Now they have enough resources, they have enough cannons, gunpowder, to think about actually attacking the British and getting them out of Boston. So there's a hill, uh, south of Boston, it's called the Dorchester Heights, and it looms over Boston from the south, and if it was fortified, It would be a very commanding, it would be a very commanding position. The problem is the British absolutely hammer them with cannons anytime they try and take and fortify the Dorchester Heights. But on the night of March 4th, they fortify the Hill. Henry Knox bombards the British with cannons the entire time to keep them occupied so they don't see what's going on. And then another brilliant thing that George Washington does is he has them prefabricate the fortifications. So they build these kind of modular walls. Down below the hill. And then in the middle of the night, they just bring up the hills and kind of push them", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/george-washington", "title": "George Washington", "chunk_index": 43, "publication_date": "2024-05-03", "total_chunks_in_doc": 96}}

And then in the middle of the night , they just bring up the hills and kind of push them George Washington: into the ground. So they don't have to do all this construction that takes time on top of the hill. Uh, they also get lucky with, um, weather. So it's foggy down in the city. So the British can't see what's happening, but it's a clear moonlit night above the fog so that the Americans have a clear view with which to build their fort on the Dorchester Heights so the British wake up on the morning of March 5th, 1776, and they see an impregnable fort in a perfect position firing down on them. So this is untenable for them. And within a couple of weeks they pack up. And by March 17th, the British flee from Boston. It's a huge feather in the cap of George Washington. He has scored the first real victory of the revolutionary war. He has scored the first real victory of the revolutionary war. It is in many ways symbolic. They had secured Boston, but they hadn't really done any damage to the British army. Nevertheless, Boston was an important city and it was important to secure it for the American cause. Now the British are at sea. Uh, they don't have any beachhead, any major presence in the colonies. And so the next target becomes pretty clear. And that is going to be New York. New York is America's second biggest city, after its capital, Philadelphia. It is also a hotbed of Tories, of Loyalists, people who want to stay with the British Crown. And, it has all of these deep water ports, and so it lends itself to naval action. You know, the British have Pretty good army, especially compared to the colonies, but they have the world's greatest Navy by far. They have this amazing Navy. And so New York is a perfect place to use it because you have not only the ocean, the sea, but you have all these rivers and little bays. You can basically attack any part of the city from the sea. And so it makes it a perfect place for them to come and land and establish a beachhead. And so, with the consent, and so with the advice and consent of the Continental Congress, foolishly George Washington decides to try to defend New York City.

And so he let himself be convinced and Congress really believed that the psychological effect of giving up America's second biggest city undefended would be too great on the American public. It looked like throwing in the towel. So they say, Hey, we have to try and defend New York. And so they try and it is a complete disaster. From beginning to end. And it starts right when the British arrive. They had had a presence in the colonies. They had sent some troops to Boston, which they were trying to hold Boston with those troops. In July, the Americans declare independence. And so the British say, okay, we're doing this for real. So they send half their Navy. They have this global Navy that is supposed to be in Europe and in India and in Africa. Well, they take half of it and they send it all to the British. to New York, along with 30, along with 32, 000 troops. Um, and so you read the accounts, uh, well, let me just read some of the accounts of the Americans seeing this happening. Here's what they say. And so the Americans are just overawed. By this, um, um, here is what one American soldier named Daniel McCurtain, he sees this happening. And here's what he writes. I could not believe my eyes, keeping my eyes fixed at the very spot. Judge you of my surprise. When in about 10 minutes, the whole bay was full of shipping. I declare, I thought all London was afloat. Now, keep in mind. Now, keep in mind the largest city. In the American colonies on the North American continent is Philadelphia with about 40, 000 residents. This British naval fleet has more people in it than that. Like, so like that is the peak of American experience in terms of dense population. And now they're seeing more than that. And it's all in a Navy coming to destroy them. And so you have American soldiers who are supposed to be preparing for an attack. And they're just doing nothing. Like they're just looking at this overwhelming force coming to attack them and, uh, they're, they're frozen with fear and with awe at the spectacle of this amazing Navy and army coming to destroy them.

Uh , Americans don ' t man their posts . The British Admiral in George Washington: charge, Lord Richard Howe was an extremely capable commander and at every turn he bests Washington's defenses. First he lands on Long Island and embarrassingly defeats the American forces there. In fact, 8, 000 American forces are nearly captured and Washington has to lead a daring nighttime escape to keep them from being captured. The men start to panic at the end of this escape and start cramming on board the last transport boats, which starts to sink them. There's too many men on the boats and Washington picks up a massive rock and threatens to sink the boats himself if soldiers don't disembark. And then he says, look, calm down. I promise you, I will be the last one to leave. So if anyone gets captured, it's going to be me. And so this calms men down, some of them get off the boats and there's a more orderly, uh, and there's a more orderly retreat after that. And true to his word, he boards the last boat out of Brooklyn, and he can hear the British firing at them through the thick fog as they depart. And this move basically saves the revolution. If that many thousands of soldiers had been captured that early in the war, it was basically a quarter, I think more than a quarter of the forces they had raised. And so, you know, if they were all gone, it's game over. So just getting them out alive is a sort of mini victory. So he gets them out of Brooklyn and over to Manhattan. They are then defeated in Manhattan. They go up, uh, they are defeated at a couple of different forts. One of them named Fort Washington, complete catastrophe at Fort Washington. There. Uh, about 3, 000 soldiers are taken prisoner and hundreds are killed, along with much needed supplies. Uh, after that, the British keep marching, and then north of Manhattan, they are defeated again, at a place called White Plains. And at this point, and basically the whole time, American morale is breaking. None of these people are trained soldiers, almost, you have a very few veterans from the French and Indian War. Very, very few. Most of these people are completely green, have never been in combat before. And they are facing hardened, trained, professional British soldiers.

And so they ' re just melting anytime they face , uh , a determined British attack . And George Washington cannot George Washington: believe the cowardice that his men are displaying. And so at White Plains, he has like a breakdown. Here's the quote, fuming. He flung his hat to the ground and shouted, are these the men with which I am to defend America? Yeah. According to another account, he swore, Good God, have I got such troops as these? This display of Washington's wrath still could not stem the panic. As he told Hancock, I used every means in my power to rally and get them into some order, but my attempts were fruitless and ineffectual. Another officer says this, Colonel George Whedon says that Washington grew so distraught that he struck several officers in their flight. It is extraordinary to think of Washington flogging officers amid It is extraordinary to think of Washington flogging officers amid a battle, a measure of his impotent frustration and shattered nerves. It eventually gets even worse. George Washington, General Green George Washington, General Green wrote, was so vexed at the infamous conduct of his troops that he sought death rather than life. And what he's referring to here is at a certain point, he's whipping all these people. He's smacking them with the broad side of a sword, uh, yelling at men to, to stay and fight. And soon everyone just keeps fleeing. And so he just stops in the middle of the road and he says, well, I'm not retreating. And he stands there as the British march closer and closer to him. Eventually his aides come up and grab his horse and like tear him away from the battle. Um, rather than letting him die, essentially a suicidal death. This is the end of what is. A very ignominious defeat, uh, all these battles in New York. Here's what Chernow writes. He says, it was a defeat without redeeming features, a disastrous campaign in which Washington's army had suffered one humiliating, costly reverse after another. The outcome could only have deepened Washington's nightmarish sense of helplessness. Just as he fretted about expiring enlistments, he had losses of almost 3, 000 men killed or captured. At the same time, a huge cache of valuable muskets and cannon had fallen into British hands.

And then there is another kind of miraculous escape over the Delaware river to get his troops to safety in this final escape to save , you George Washington: know, some part of the continental army. They need cover fire from the British. There is one and there's one artillery detachment that stands very bravely and fires very accurately, just serves incredibly capably and provides this very necessary cover fire so that some men can be rescued. And Washington takes note of the officer in charge of this Um, artillery battery and his name is Alexander Hamilton. And so he says, okay, I got to remember that name. This, this guy seems very capable. Once they set up camp, uh, in Pennsylvania, kind of away from the action gets his men removed from danger. Uh, true. Now writes dismayed by his officer's behavior, Washington scouted for new talent and was impressed by the proficiency of a young artillery captain named Alexander Hamilton. As the latter superintended earthworks, as the latter, as the latter superintended earthworks construction, Washington entered into conversation with him, invited him to his tent and received an impression of his military talent. So thus began one of the most important relationships of Hamilton's life. So that's began one of the most important relationships of George Washington's life. I won't say too much about Hamilton on this episode, cause I'm going to do an episode about Hamilton. Um, but I think people misunderstand Hamilton. I'm glad for the play because it puts him on people's radar. He was maybe really vital that he was really vital to the American founding. Um, Hamilton was probably the greatest mind of the American revolution. That's what I think even more so than Jefferson, Franklin, Madison, um, even Washington. Hamilton had the most greatness inside of him. If America had had a Napoleon, it would have been Hamilton. We'll get more to that story. , but look out for the Hamilton episode. That's going to be what I do after George Washington. I think his greatness is underestimated, uh, by most people and is not helped, frankly, by the play Hamilton. Like I'm glad it puts people on his radar. I'm glad it puts him on people's radar, but I think most people think of him as like scrappy and inspirational.

So , um , I mean , I guess George Washington: that's one good thing you can say is that Washington is starting to form a core. Of capable officers beneath him. He was, you know, seeing some men who were really incapable and others who could distinguish themselves a little bit, even in the midst of this disaster. But still things are really bad after the invasion of New York. And the problem is that problems, we get problems, everything compounds. So you lose all these battles. And now it becomes difficult to issue currency. No one wants to take your American dollars because they're like, well, it looks like you guys are about to lose to the British anyway, and this is just going to be valueless paper in a couple of months. So you can't issue currency. Therefore you can't raise money. And because you don't have money, you can't raise more troops because you can't pay them. And therefore you have fewer men with which to fight battles. And so it's a vicious cycle, right? It all compounds. And so Washington knows that he needs to find a way to change this narrative and change it fast. So that's going to be his next mission.

Okay. üìç Okay. So Washington badly needs to restore hope in the American cause. As Napoleon said, more wars are lost by loss of hope. And, and so Washington wants to counter attack. The problem that he's facing is that, um, all these enlistments, all these men who signed up for military service in the Continental Army, their enlistments are going to end. At the end of the year. And it's now December. So he's got a month to attack with badly demoralized men who just want to go home and get away from all this horrible, you want to get away from this horrible demoralizing war that they've been a part of so far.

Luckily , the mood of the army is somewhat stabilized by another pamphlet from Thomas George Washington: Paine. He writes one of the most famous passages of all time. He says, these are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and sunshine patriot will in the crisis shrink from the service of their country. But he that stands at now deserves the love and thanks of every man and woman. And so this stabilizes the mood a little bit, but still a military victory is needed to change the narrative. And so Washington plans this daring raid on British positions in New Jersey. And again, it's going to happen before the enlistments expire at the end of the year. And so the attack is scheduled for Christmas day, December 25th. The odds are badly against them. It's a pretty desperate mission. They have to get a victory somehow, though, the revolution is crumbling around them. And so the actual password that they use in this secret operation in its planning is victory or death. That is how dire this is victory or death. This thing has to work. The morning comes and there are three separate detachments that are all supposed to attack in concert. You know, they have their, their times when they're supposed to land and the weather is so bad. It's so cold and freezing. The two other detachments figure. There's no way this thing is going ahead, and they call off the attack. But George Washington proceeds with his forces. They have to cross the Delaware River in order to attack the British positions. And the Delaware River is partially frozen and has ice flows floating down it, which are very dangerous and could easily capsize their boats. But Washington says, hey, it's victory or death. We got one shot, we're taking it. And so he grows, And so he goes, and crossing the Delaware is one of the most famous moments of the Revolutionary War. And it led to one of the most famous paintings of the Revolutionary War. You can go look up George Washington crossing of You can go look up George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River. You can go look up Washington crossing the Delaware. If you're American, you have definitely seen it. Even if you're not, you may have seen it. It's an extremely famous painting.

Uh , however it is so cold that on the March four to five men just lay down on the side of the road and die from cold exposure . The George Washington: upside of this horrible weather is that when they make it to Trenton, the city they were attacking, the German forces there, they were mercenaries for the British, were so convinced that it was so cold. No one would ever attack on a day like today that they're completely unprepared for the American attack. And so it's this lightning surprise attack and it is a huge victory, hundreds of casualties, and the Americans only lose. So they actually lost more people to the weather than they did in the actual fighting. The traditional story that you hear sometimes is that because it was Christmas, the Germans were drunk and, uh, weren't prepared for the attack. That's actually not true. If you look at the sources, it's just that they weren't prepared because the weather was so cold. And Washington decided to attack anyway. Uh, not knowing that two thirds of his forces wouldn't be there with him. Anyways, it's a huge success. They not only capture all of these forces, but they capture a ton of much needed supplies. You know, muskets, cannons, ammunition, as well as blankets and clothing. And then, um, and they hold the position for a few days. And then when the British come to attack, rather than just retreating, because they couldn't hold the position, uh, from, from the whole British army, they But they retreat to, they retreat, but they don't just retreat to the safety of their own positions. They actually go and attack another city, Princeton, New Jersey. And that's another success during this attack on Princeton. You have one of my favorite stories from the war. There is an advanced party that is kind of scouting ahead and they stumble into the British. They're surprised some of them get shot. And so these Americans take off running and they run into the main force of the army commanded personally by George Washington, just as this main force is about to engage with the main force of the British troops. And George Washington sees all these men running, and he says, 'Parade with us, my brave fellows! he exclaimed, waving his hat. 'There is but a handful of the enemy, and we will have them directly!

{"text": ", and we will have them directly ! According to his aide de camp , Colonel John Fitzgerald , Washington rallied the men with an act of unbelievable bravery . He reined in his horse , faced the enemy directly , and simply froze . Yet again , the intrepid George Washington: Washington acted as if he were protected by an invisible aura. ' I shall never forget what I felt when I saw him brave all the danger The End 'I shall never forget what I felt when I saw him brave all the dangers of the field and his important life hanging, as if it were, by a single hair, with a thousand deaths flying around him, wrote a young Philadelphia officer. Believe me, I thought not of myself. So he calls out to these men and he performs this unbelievable act of bravery, just standing there exposed to enemy fire, musket balls are flying all around him. Somehow he doesn't get hit and doesn't die. And that stems the retreat of this advanced party that had been running away. Another great quote comes from one of his secretaries. Um, Another great quote comes from one of his secretaries. He says, As he issued the command to fire, Washington, on his white charger, was such a conspicuous target that Fitzgerald clapped his hat over his eyes because he couldn't bear to see him shot. When the fusillade of bullets ended and the enemy scattered, Fitzgerald finally peeked and saw Washington untouched, sitting proudly atop his horse, wreathed by eddying smoke. Thank God your excellency is safe, Fitzgerald said to him, almost weeping with relief. Washington, unphased, took his hand fondly. Away, my dear colonel. And bring up the troops. The day is our own. Okay. So I think that's a story that gives you an idea of why these people would so willingly go die for him, even though he had lost a few battles in New York. Like, uh, it is amazing what that personal touch can do to inspire people, even when things are not going your way. That personal bravery, that skin in the game, um, exposing yourself to the same sorts of dangers as your men goes a long way. So, this attack, this victory at Trenton and Princeton, really changes the calculus of the war. The British had been thinking, We might have this thing wrapped up in a couple months. Um, you know, it's not just the actual military victories. It's the public perception, which is totally going the opposite way. And now this is enough to stabilize the American public and say, no, we can counterpunch, we can stand with these guys, we can fight with them.

They're not going to just be able to overwhelm and impress them and convince them to come to terms. These victories at Trenton and Princeton are what vault Washington into an even greater tier of celebrity. Uh, there's one newspaper, the Pennsylvania, there's one newspaper, the Pennsylvania Journal, which writes, had he lived in the days of idolatry, Washington would have been worshipped as a god. And I think that's a pretty good summary of how far his star had risen. Uh, one thing I want to pull out of this that's interesting to me. Is, you have this pattern with Washington, which is, he kind of bungles some things. You have this pattern with Washington, which is, um, things do not go his way until his back is against the wall, and then he pulls an amazing victory, uh, out of his hat. So there, there's a quote from one of his colonels who said, his excellency George Washington never appeared to so much advantage as in the hour of distress. Which is true, you see it again and again. His Excellency George Washington never appeared so much His Excellency George Washington never appeared to so much advantage as in the hour of distress. And so, you know, that's a really interesting point. But part of me wonders, okay, what can you learn from this? Because you're not going to intentionally put your back against the wall. You're not going to intentionally lose everything just so that you can You're not going to intentionally lose everything just to improve your performance. Like that doesn't make sense. Right. Um, but I think what you can do is, uh, is get what I call nothing to lose energy. Like just get into that mindset where you feel like you have nothing to lose. Even if you do, I think that's a powerful framework to evaluate decisions is what would I do, what decision would I make? If I had nothing to lose for me personally, I have a mortgage, a car payment, three kids.

But when I get too caught up in that , I make bad decisions . Instead , when I just think as George Washington: if I have nothing to lose, as if I'm a new podcaster, just making this podcast for myself, that's when I make the best decisions and make the best content. And so. Um, yeah, I think there's something to that having that nothing to lose mentality you gotta think, uh, you know, as Washington did, he wrote it on all his papers. He wrote it on his pen. It was the password of this operation of this great victory at Trenton and Princeton victory or death. All right. Sometimes it's good to take that mentality, victory or death. Okay, but as I mentioned, the Americans can't actually hold these positions in Princeton or Trenton. It's more of a raid. They take some stuff, they embarrass the British, they improve morale, and then they retreat back to their battle lines in Pennsylvania. The British decide to attack Pennsylvania, and specifically they're trying to attack And specifically, they're trying to take Philadelphia. It's the largest city in North America. It is the capital of the United States, the United Colonies. And so it's going to be a huge symbolic victory. And so the British attack, and once again, this General Howe just completely outmaneuvers George Washington. Uh, they defeat them at the battle of Brandywine and they're able to take Philadelphia. The Continental Congress has to move and they go to first York, Pennsylvania. Later Lancaster, Pennsylvania. And eventually they moved to Baltimore, Maryland to have their capital because they cannot continue to meet in British occupied territory. Washington attempts a counter attack at a place called Germantown, Pennsylvania. It's unsuccessful because of some strategic errors by Washington and his lieutenants, but it's not really a defeat. It's more of a costly draw. Um, it's a disappointment. They had hoped for it to be a big victory, uh, but there's kind of even casualties and they're able to retreat. What it does show is that, uh, once again, they're battling with the British. It's not just one loss after another. They're giving as well as taking and, uh, it stabilizes public opinion. So with the loss of Philadelphia, the continental army retreats to an area called Valley Forge. Where they settle in for a brutal winter. They build their own village.

{"text": ". So with the loss of Philadelphia , the continental army retreats to an area called Valley Forge . Where they settle in for a brutal winter . They build their own village . Uh , they have basically no supplies , so they have to chop down trees and George Washington: build their own little huts. They, many of the soldiers are hungry. Many of them are half naked. You know, if you've ever been to the East coast of the United States, the Northeast, like the winters are pretty brutal. The winters are pretty brutal. They're quite cold and they have to make it through this winter. Many of them don't have shoes. Many of them have torn coats and torn pants. Like these people are unclothed. It's a really bad situation. And, and what makes it worse is this situation is fairly avoidable. Congress is not giving them the supplies they need. And in fact, instead, uh, they tell them, you know, why don't you just go scour around, see what you can find, take it from the countryside. This is exactly the opposite of what Washington wants to do. Remember he wanted to do things the right way. That means not stealing from people. That means acting like a professional force. And this is not what a professional force does. They don't reign. They don't raid American farms for food and clothing, but it's what they're forced to do in order to make it through the winter. Like I said, this is avoidable. Congress was reaching the limit of their ability to finance the war, but there was another issue, which is that they were intentionally hamstringing the army. Uh, Flexner in his biography says that this was quote, the solution to the dangers seen in a standing army and too much continental unity. And that it was obvious and so deeply rooted in American tradition that the civilian leaders found it maddening that Washington couldn't understand. So, like, this is an amazing situation to me. You want independence. You've got this army that is fighting, sacrificing, and dying for you in order to achieve it. And Continental Congress is essentially saying, yeah, but we're kind of worried about their power and influence if we win. So we're not going to give them what they need so that they don't get too powerful, like intentionally hamstringing your army, even as they're trying to win a victory for you so that they don't win too completely is just. A mind bogglingly bad decision. I can't believe that the Continental Congress was even somewhat thinking about it in this way, and they were they, you know, and they were, I mean, there were material constraints", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/george-washington", "title": "George Washington", "chunk_index": 56, "publication_date": "2024-05-03", "total_chunks_in_doc": 96}}

I can ' t believe that the Continental Congress was even somewhat thinking about it in this way , and they were they , you know , and they were , I mean , there were material constraints George Washington: as well. Um, but they were definitely thinking about not letting this army get too powerful and that was part of the calculus. It was a very stupid decision on multiple levels because as we will see later in this episode, It almost backfired, like, like the very fact of them not supplying the army is what almost leads to that army becoming too powerful. We'll get to that at the end of the episode. But for our purposes, the point is, it's a very cold winter, the army is very poorly supplied, and thousands of men die of cold and disease. And it is only the charismatic leadership of Washington that holds the army together. The important thing is just to keep the army in the field, so that the revolution can go on. And he does that at the same time when he's in Valley Forge, he comes upon a threat from an unexpected place. And that is from within the army, from something called the Conway cabal. Basically there was one other general who had accomplished some things and shown himself to be very capable, a general Gates, and he had just scored a major victory in the North and upstate New York. And so he had a few of his cronies seek to have Washington removed from office and they want him Gates. made the commander in chief in his place. Washington is able to survive it, and the way he's able to survive this kind of attempted coup is interesting. He's kind of above the fray. He only marginally engages in the back and forth, tit for tat, of, you know, Well, you messed up this. Well, no, you did this. Yadda yadda yadda. He does a little. Like, he makes the arguments, but he tries to be kind of subtle, and he tries to be above it all. The real reason people are afraid to go with Gates is is outlined very well by Flexner, who says Washington's presumptive successor, Gates, would not have been a replacement, but a new departure. He was an altogether different kind of man, a controversialist, an extremist. He was bitter against the upper classes who had thwarted his career in England, and he had sharp elbows. Backed by the New England Radicals and their allies elsewhere, he had allowed his battle for the Northern Command against the conservative Schuyler to continue. To be fought not only on military, but on ideological grounds. The opposition to Washington tended to come from the very ideological groups. Those who most wished", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/george-washington", "title": "George Washington", "chunk_index": 57, "publication_date": "2024-05-03", "total_chunks_in_doc": 96}}
{"text": "their allies elsewhere , he had allowed his battle for the Northern Command against the conservative Schuyler to continue . To be fought not only on military , but on ideological grounds . The opposition to Washington tended to come from the very ideological groups . Those who most wished George Washington: a social as well as a national revolution. Should Gates replace Washington, extreme it should Gates replace Washington. Extremism on the left would be encouraged. The right would feel a necessity to right would feel a necessity to defend itself and the whole cause would be sent spinning toward the in the left. And the whole cause would be sent spinning toward the inter Nicene controversy and perhaps warfare, which all responsible leaders, left as well as right, knew must above all things be avoided. So, essentially what he's getting at there is, you have the American Revolution, which is very different from the French Revolution, and part of the reason it was different is you have these radicals, these liberals, who kind of favored a French style revolution. That is what Gates favored. But you had moderates, like Washington, and even outright conservatives, who who were still a part of the revolution, uh, for more moderate reasons, right? Just, we want to be independent from Great Britain. We want to do our own thing. We don't want a complete social upheaval. As, uh, Flexner said, a social revolution. They didn't want that. And so it is this more moderate revolution. And it wouldn't have been if Washington had been replaced with Gates. Okay. So once again, you have this idea that doing things the right way pays off in the end, people still go with Washington, despite his losses, despite Gates looking like a pretty good commander because he does things the right way. And they figured, no, this is what we really want. We want a socially stable, moderate revolution. We don't want these extremists in charge being a fire brand. Grabbing attention, um, being a firebrand screaming for attention, being very ideological. Um, that, that's fine. It gets some attention in the short term and you can get some followers that way, but ultimately people want to go, but ultimately people want to follow stable, serious people. Like Washington. So once again, it's worth doing things the right way, being stable, being serious, being pragmatic, that's what ultimately people want to associate themselves with. Well, so Gates is big victory. Um, it might not have made him the commander in chief of Washington stays the commander in chief, but one thing it did do, which was very important for the revolution is it.

And that means money, troops, and ships. And by the way, it's not just Gates and his victory. Also, Benjamin Franklin is hugely responsible for this. We'll get more into that. Uh, this is going to be a series on the American founders. So we're doing Washington, Hamilton, and then Benjamin Franklin. But this is a huge, huge deal. diplomatic victory for Benjamin Franklin, who manages to convince the French that, uh, the Americans are a winning ticket and that they should ally with them, and that this is a chance for them to score a victory against Great Britain. So the entrance of France into the war completely changes the game. Um, you know, previously, again, they had sent half their Navy over just to fight this one war with these pesky little American colonies, a huge chunk of their forces, and now the British are going to be distracted. They have to defend way more places. They have to think about fighting in Europe. They have to think about fighting in the Caribbean and a ton of forces actually immediately leave the Caribbean. The colonies and they're no longer able to defend Philadelphia because they don't have enough men. So they retreat from Philadelphia. Washington pounces attacks them while they're retreating. They don't win the battle. Um, but they do have, uh, again, sort of a, but they do once again, have a draw. And once again, it's kind of showing, okay, the Americans might not have won this battle, but you know, the, these guys are just supposed to be militia men. They're not supposed to be able. To line up pound for pound against the British and fight them at all. And they do. And so this is showing more and more people that, Hey, the Americans have a serious chance. And so eventually the Spanish enter the war with the French against the British. And so you've got all these European powers. aligning with the Americans against the British, which is tipping the balance in favor of the Americans. So after this, this one attack by Washington's battle Monmouth, uh, what this leads to is a big waiting game.

And so Washington keeps his army in the field . Uh , there are some George Washington: skirmishes back and forth between the Americans and the British, but mostly it's just a waiting game to see what the French will do. After a couple of years of waiting and skirmishing and still just struggling to keep his army in the field, the cavalry finally does show up, the French show up in North America. And at this point, you know, the French army, like the British army is much more professional than the American army. They just know what they're doing. They know how to march in formation. They know how to fight in formation. They've been doing this for a long time. And so George Washington kind of takes a back seat. He is nominally in charge. The French pay him lip service. They say, yes, yes, yes, we're serving under your command. This is your revolution. But in reality, they often don't listen to his advice and they do their own thing. They come up with their own plans, which the Americans have to respond to because they're the ones with the men and the money. Uh, because of this dynamic, you have essentially a repeat of because of this dynamic, you have essentially what is a repeat of what happened in the French and Indian war. If you remember at the end of episode one, George Washington argues very vociferously for a certain road of attack against the French. Um, and ultimately, uh, you know, he argues that if they take this other road, they're going to fail. Well, the British general in charge takes the other road and they're victorious. It's a little bit embarrassing for Washington. Same thing happens here. Washington says, no, I really think we should attack New York. That is where the British are centered. And, uh, that is, And that is the key to the whole thing. The French favor, uh, attack in the South. So the, the British land an expeditionary force in Virginia, and they say, well, let's, let's take out this expeditionary force. And so they kind of force his hand. And so once again, and so once again, the war takes a course that Washington did not approve of, and once again, it is very successful. , they managed to bottle up the British troops and, um, they managed to bottle up the British troops and besiege them.

And so, uh, the Americans are attacking actually in the climactic moment of the attack, Alexander Hamilton is the one who leads the attack is very successful in that way. , finally, the situation is looking really desperate for the British and, uh, they realized they only have one hope. Which is to escape George Washington style in the middle of the night. And so they try this, they get some boats and they sneak out and the Americans have no idea. And it looks like it's going to be successful. Uh, here's what Flexner writes. The God of the weather who had so often interfered in the affairs of this war had interfered again, the storm passed and under a pink dawn that glinted, so they try to escape. And but what happens is that a storm comes in the middle of the night. And blows the boats back to Yorktown so they can't get away. Here's what Flexner writes. He says, The god of the weather, who had so often interfered in the affairs of this war, had interfered again. The storm passed, and under a pink dawn that glinted on what foliage had escaped the destruction of warfare, messengers galloped to Washington's tent. British troops were on the river. Cornwallis had evidently tried to ferry his troops to Gloucester and had been interrupted by the weather. He was now bringing back those soldiers who had got across. And so because they can't get across, they have to surrender. Six years of living in, Six years, So the British can't escape. I like to think of what Washington must've felt that morning. I like to think about what Washington must've felt that morning when the letter came, you know, had been six years of revolution, six years of stress, six years of suffering, six years of often difficult circumstances, six years of just trying to hold together this army. And. Then one day everything changed. , here's what Flexner writes about what happened. Washington had just sat down to his morning's correspondence when in came another messenger. This one very excited. He carried a letter, which had come out of Yorktown under a flag of truce.

Sir, I propose a cessation of hostilities for 24 hours, and that two officers may be appointed by each side to meet at Mr. Moore's house to settle terms for the surrender of the posts of York and Gloucester. I have the honor to be, et cetera, Cornwallis. And so the British surrender, according to legend, according to legend, I don't know if this is very well documented, but supposedly the British, when they are marching out of Yorktown, uh, surrendering, you know, they're surrounded by the American forces. The band plays a song called the world turned upside down. Uh, which was sort of a shot at the Americans, even in their moment of defeat, saying, Can you believe this? These filthy colon Can you believe this? These filthy colonials, these militiamen, they aren't even real soldiers. Can you believe that we're surrendering to these guys? Truly, the world has turned upside down. Washington didn't know it at the moment. Um, Washington knew This was a pivotal moment that this was a turning point. Uh, he didn't understand that this would be the last battle of the war. . It took a few months for everything to unwind for the negotiators to work out the details of the treaties out in Europe, but it turned out that yes, there would be no more large scale fighting um, And with Yorktown, the war was over and America had independence in the aftermath, you know, there is this idea that Washington could have been King and I suppose if he had really wanted to be King, that would have been possible. There is one soldier who proposed it to him. And here's what Washington said. He said, be assured, sir, no occurrence in the course of the war has given me more painful sensations than your information of there being such ideas existing in the army, as you have expressed, and as I must view, with abhorrence and reprehend with severity, I am much at a loss to conceive what part of my conduct could have given encouragement to an address which, to me, seems big with the greatest mischiefs that can befall my country. If I am not deceived in the knowledge of myself, you could not have found a person to whom your schemes are more disagreeable. , so, there was never any realistic point of view.

Did I do that would lead you to believe that there was even a modicum of possibility that I would want to be King. So no, what there was a chance of though, is a military dictatorship. And that is because the army is very upset. And now there are no British to fight. They have not been well supplied throughout the war. They have not been paid. Some of them are years. And so, uh, they go to continental Congress and they say, okay, we're ready for our back pay and continental Congress says, uh, yeah, we can't do that. Sorry. We don't have the money. , can't raise the debt. So, you know, deal with it. We'll, we'll, we'll do the best we can. They really drag their feet. They're not paying them. So the officers get together and they say, uh, we should take matters into our own hands. We're not talking about necessarily a total overthrow, but we should gather the troops and we should start marching. On state capitals, let these people know that we mean business. And I bet you that the money will magically appear. And so, um, you know, some people who serve both in continental Congress and in the military are fans of this. Congress is completely frozen. They don't know what to do. They, there's nothing they really can do that. This is the only army they have and it's turning on them. Here's what Flexner writes. Most of the members of Congress sat there aghast, not knowing what to do, but there were others, including men of great influence who agreed with Alexander Hamilton, that If handled properly, the desperate situation may be turned to good account. Perhaps the army could be induced to rise against the civilian authorities. Perhaps George Washington could be persuaded to lead what would be put forward as a salutary insurrection. So in other words, the government as presently constituted is not working. If they can't raise the funds, if they can't take care of their own soldiers and their own army, it's clearly not working.

Um, what Alexander Hamilton was proposing was what Alexander Hamilton was proposing was almost exactly along the lines of what would eventually be adopted as the U S constitution. But what he's trying to do is enforce it at the point of a sword. And so many, Military officers agree with this and want to do it. In fact, all of them. In fact, it's starting to look like this can't be stopped. And Hamilton is putting himself at the head of all these officers who want to do this. Washington though, is the one man who is opposed to this. Not the one man. But the one really important person, uh, and certainly the most influential person who opposes this, there is a pamphlet that's written. That's very persuasive, very well written that argues why this would be beneficial. Circulated amongst the officers and the officers are nodding their heads. They're getting on board. So they call a meeting and they really want to get Washington on board if they can, but they're fully prepared to go forward without Washington if they have to. So they have this meeting and Washington is asked to speak. And what happens next is one of, uh, The great moments that makes Washington. Immortal. Uh, here's what happens. He gets up and he makes an argument and, uh, fails. , it falls flat on its face. No one is interested, and then this is what happens next. Here's what Flexner writes. Washington had finished his prepared speech, but the chill in the temple had not. Washington had finished his prepared speech, but the chill in the room had not thawed the familiar faces looking up at him were uneasy, perplexed Solen Washington reached in his pocket and pulled out a piece of paper. This he stated was a letter from a member of Congress that would show the officers. what that body was trying to do and what the problems were. He would read it. The officers stirred impatiently in their seats. And then suddenly, every heart missed a beat. Something was the matter with His Excellency. He seemed unable to read the paper. He paused in bewilderment. He fumbled in his waistcoat pocket. And then, he pulled out something that only his intimates had seen him wear. A pair of glasses.

This simple statement achieved what all Washington's rhetoric and all his arguments had been unable to achieve. The officers were instantly in tears, and from behind the shining drops, their eyes looked with love at the commander who had led them all so far and long. And it's a traumatic gesture, and with that simple statement, gentlemen, you will permit me to put on my spectacles for, I have not only grown gray, but almost blind in the service of my country. He melts the hearts of all these officers and they agree with him. They agree not to go forward with this military coup to submit to civilian leadership and to take, you know, whatever is given to them. George Washington was a master of the dramatic gesture, whether that was standing in the face of enemy fire. Or taking out his glasses to read a letter, um, or taking out his glasses to read a letter or physically pulling apart, uh, or physically pulling apart, fighting soldiers during a brawl. These gestures had a way of conveying what pure logic could not. you know, Washington was a master of political theater, a master of drama. And I think the meat. And I think the thing that made him so effective was that he didn't appear to be dramatic. He was totally unselfconscious. Um, you know, one of the best things to dispel. You know, one thing that really breaks drama is when you become aware that you're in a drama, when you become aware that something is, um, when you become aware that something is intentionally dramatic, but when it feels like you're really a part of the movie. Right? When, when it feels like everything is authentic, that's when you can really get carried away by these dramatic gestures. And so Washington's obvious sincerity, his seriousness, is what enables all of these dramatic gestures to be so successful. And so that is where we will end it with Washington's most successful move of the revolution. And that is convincing everyone that what is needed is not a military push. What is needed is not a military, what is needed is not a military overthrow. What is needed is now to submit to civilian authority and to come together as the United States of America.

So I ' m going to run briefly as I usually do through some of the lessons George Washington: that we have learned. One is physical presence. One is physical presence and the power of strong physicality. Another is, another is be honest, but not too honest. You know, George Washington was known for his trustworthiness, his reliability, When it came to deceiving the enemy, he lied where he needed to. He engaged in spy craft and in deceiving the enemy. And sometimes you got to be crafty about the image that you project to others. Another lesson is to get a great, another lesson is to get a great group of young people around you. Your tribe of maniacs, your young, ambitious hustlers who are gonna help you get where you want to go. And because he could get the buy in from the Alexander Hamilton's of the world is a large part of what allowed him to be so successful. So to answer the initial question, how was it that you. That George Washington was such a successful general, despite not being a great battlefield general. , and I think he compares favorably with Napoleon Bonaparte, who is probably the greatest battlefield general of all time and yet, uh, left his country in ruins and Washington is kind of the opposite of that, and that is because Washington always kept his eyes on the final goal. You know, Napoleon loved the battlefield for the battlefield's sake, and that has its own beauty to it, but Washington loved it for what it created. And so he always kept his eyes on what it was that he was trying to create. Therefore, he was successful in the larger endeavor, despite some failures along the way. There's a quote from Flexner like, an intelligent comparison between Washington and the celebrated soldiers of the past is greatly impeded by a fact too often overlooked. Washington was never truly a military man. He remained to the end of the war, a civilian serving half reluctantly in uniform. And he goes on to talk about, and he goes on to talk about what I just said, that the greatest victories of Washington's were over the hearts and minds of the American people and getting them to buy in to this new endeavor into the United States of America.

{"text": "the crucial battles of the war were in the arenas of public , were in the arenas of public opinion . And then I , uh , I ' ll close with one more quote that I like that captures many of Washington ' s virtues , uh , is George Washington: by a French contemporary. One of these officers that came over with the French army. And was observing Washington for the first time. And here's what he said. Uh, and here's what he said. Brave without temerity. Brave without temerity. Laborious without ambition. Generous without prodigality. Noble without pride. Virtuous without severity. He seems always to have avoided passing beyond those limits where the virtues, by clothing themselves in more lively, But more changeable and doubtful colors may be mistaken for false. This is the seventh year he has commanded the army and he has obeyed Congress. More need not be said. That's it. Um, in the next episode, we will talk about George Washington and his presidency. And how he sets the United States of America on the right foot and really establishes the future of the nation as the first president of the United States of America. So until next time, thank you for listening to How to Take Over the World. One last point, one last point about Washington that I didn't mention is that many people think he was dyslexic because he struggled with writing and spelling correctly. for his entire life and exhibited many of the, and exhibited many of the characteristics of dyslexia that you see in modern people who have dyslexia. , because he was dyslexic, Washington would have loved Because he was dyslexic, Washington would have loved speechify, which is a startup that was started by my friend, which is a service that was started by my friend, Cliff Weitzman, uh, who himself is dyslexic. Who himself was dyslexic. And so struggled to be able to read everything that he wanted to digest and understand in order to take over the world in his own way. And so what he figured out was a way to turn almost any written material Basically into a podcast. And so I use this for the research into this episode. Um, and so I use speechify all the time. I used speechify for the research for pulling quotes for this episode. So you can listen to articles, you can listen to books that don't have an audible version. You can listen to emails and newsletters. For this episode. I actually listened to the Ron Chernow biography in speechify. It actually does have an audible version.

Thanks for listening to how to take over the world. üìç Hello and welcome to how to take over the world. This is Ben Wilson. Welcome to part three on the life of George Washington. This will cover from the end of the revolutionary war through his presidency and to the end of his life. I think that the presidency of George Washington is probably the most underrated part of his legacy. If you're an American like I am, and you grew up hearing about George Washington, I feel like you hear a lot about him as the revolutionary general and his heroic efforts there. And you hear less about his presidency and how impactful that was. And he genuinely. Shaped the nation, shaped what the United States would become. He was an amazing president, uh, like really effective, did a really good job as a president. Uh, and that's just not something I knew a lot about. So I think it's a really interesting part of his story. Um, and I think it's a really interesting part of his story. Uh, before we get into it, I will be releasing shortly the Washington guide to taking over the world. And that will be available to subscribers only. So if you want to hear.

George Washington: supercast. And that link, as always, is in the show notes. So to start off with George Washington, uh, ends his service as the leader of the military forces of the United States of America and goes back to Mount Vernon, his farm and finds it in ruinous condition. It had not been kept up well while he was serving in the military. And yeah, he just finds things really run down. Uh, it was not profitable. Lots of parts of the estate had been neglected. So he goes about trying to set everything right. Uh, he enjoys being a gentleman farmer. One of the things, however, he doesn't enjoy is his celebrity. People from all walks of life want to come to Mount Vernon and meet George Washington. And he felt like he couldn't really turn anyone away. It's because there was this Republican attitude of equality. No one's better than anyone. And so for him to say to a prospective visitor, you know, no, I can't receive you right now would have gone against public attitude. And so he just had to take in everyone that came by and people were constantly coming by to meet him. This really imposes upon him again, his estate is in ruinous condition is not profitable. And so he doesn't have the money to be hosting and feeding people Every day. And it's basically every day that people are coming by and expecting this treatment. So he comes to really, uh, I would say resent. This celebrity. And it's interesting to hear quotes about celebrity from the 1700s and how people felt the same way about it then that they do today. So Washington said retirement from the public walks of life has not been so productive for leisure and ease as might have been expected. And, uh, even more poignantly, you know, Benjamin Franklin had the same experience. So Washington and Franklin are the first two American celebrities. Actually, Franklin was a celebrity before Washington was. And then Washington slip, uh, actually Franklin was the first and then Washington and Benjamin Franklin and said, quote, celebrity may for a while flatter one's vanity, but its effects are troublesome. I just think that's so interesting. Like, that's what you hear from celebrities today that, , celebrity is great for a while when you become a celebrity. But then it's really a burden. And Franklin says almost exactly that back in the 1700s, one of the things that Washington does", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/george-washington", "title": "George Washington", "chunk_index": 69, "publication_date": "2024-05-03", "total_chunks_in_doc": 96}}
{"text": "' s what you hear from celebrities today that , , celebrity is great for a while when you become a celebrity . But then it ' s really a burden . And Franklin says almost exactly that back in the 1700s , one of the things that Washington does George Washington: in order to dissuade people from coming to Mount Vernon is he doesn't put up any signage and it's kind of hard to get to Alexandria, which is the nearest town is eight miles away. And you have to go through woods and, and marshes. And so he just doesn't put up any signs, hoping that people will get lost, trying to make their way to Mount Vernon. And many people do get lost, trying to find George Washington. And he likes it that way. He's trying to stay. As far away from all these visitors as he can, you know, he can't get away from it must, but you know, he can't get away from it much. And this does prove to be a huge drain on his energy and on his finances. As he goes about trying to get his affairs in order and kind of turn around his estate, he gets kind of tired of farming, of trying to make it as a farmer, you know, farming. Has always been a business where it's tough to be really, really profitable. And so he's saying, all right, can I try some different stuff? So he takes on some minor industrial projects, you know, he creates mills and distilleries and just doing anything he can to say, can I turn a profit in a different way? One of the effects of this is there's this huge divide in the United States at this time between agricultural interests who are mostly in the South. You know, these biggest States, these big farms and then industrial interests in the North. These factories and industrial interests in the North, you know, all these factories and mills and things like that. Well, his experience with this makes Washington, uh, kind of bipartisan in that way. He's open to both. So he has a history as a gentleman farmer. He kind of sees the limits of that. And he has also experience as an industrialist. And And so he's open to those interests and to increasing and improving that part of the economy as well. Makes him an ideal first president because he can understand everyone in the country and all these major interests. One of the other things, this should probably go in the end notes, but whatever, I'm going to say it here, that I thought was just kind of funny and interesting is, uh, You know, he's a, he's a very interesting guy with lots of interests", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/george-washington", "title": "George Washington", "chunk_index": 70, "publication_date": "2024-05-03", "total_chunks_in_doc": 96}}
{"text": "in the end notes , but whatever , I ' m going to say it here , that I thought was just kind of funny and interesting is , uh , You know , he ' s a , he ' s a very interesting guy with lots of interests George Washington: and he's very energetic and he can accomplish all these random things. So, uh, I'll just read one quote about one of his random accomplishments. It says, In addition to his better known title of father of his country, Washington is also revered in certain circles as the father of the American mule. So that's one of the projects that Washington undertakes is to create this new, is to create this new breed of mule. That's very productive on his farm. And he goes through this long selective breeding process of getting just the right temperament, uh, to be helpful and productive. And it takes a few generations, but he ends up, , with this American mule, which I guess now is a, a prominent and useful type of mule. so that's random. I think it gives you an idea for the energy that Washington had and his ability to accomplish things in all these different domains. You know, as Washington does this, it goes back to being a gentleman farmer. He thinks his time in the public eye. He's done and he frankly wants it to be done. However, he did have this critique of the Articles of Confederation, which was, uh, how the United States function. It was their constitution at the time, and, uh, he thought it wasn't strong enough. It wasn't robust enough. The central government was way too weak. So the Articles of Confederation basically gave all powers to the 13 states and uh, uh, made a very, very weak central government that could accomplish almost none. That could accomplish almost nothing. And Washington said, we are either a united people under one head, or we are 13 independent sovereignties, eternally counteracting each other. And so he's saying, look, if we're eternally counteracting each other, if we're always fighting against each other, then we're never going to be able to realize what we're doing. Greatness as a nation. The reason for this is that there was all this skepticism towards England and towards anything that reeked of Englishness. So Chernow writes, Americans now define themselves as the antithesis of everything English, even if that acted to their detriment. And so people are really afraid of a strong central government, because that's what England had and that's what had led to this tyranny. Or so they perceived it, uh, and led to the Revolutionary War and led to them wanting their independence.

Or so they perceived it , uh , and led to the Revolutionary War and led to them wanting their independence . But Washington , in George Washington: his role as the leader of the military, had worked from people But Washington, in his role as leader of the military, had worked in the only institution that had been a functioning, uh, That had been a functioning combination of all 13 states. And he said, you know, this is the way to go. And he thought this was the way to go. And he actually thought that the biggest, uh, threat of tyranny came from not having a strong enough central government. He wouldn't have phrased it this way, but he was afraid of the Napoleon option, right? If we don't have a strong enough central government that. Uh, it, it can handle crises as they come up, then what we're gonna have is anarchy. And when there's anarchy, people are willing to look to a strong leader who, uh, uh, can give them order, even if he's despotic. And so, uh, that's what Washington's afraid of. It would turn out to be a very prescient fear. And I think he's right. I think that the Constitution had not been adopted. There's a very strong chance that someone like this would have come along, and in fact, We'll get more into this in the Hamilton episode that's coming up. I think Alexander Hamilton would have been the American Napoleon. The two of them are extremely similar. Anyway, Washington has this belief and it seems prophetic when something happens called Shays Rebellion. And what Shaves Rebellion is, is a bunch of former soldiers, Revolutionary War soldiers, are farmers in western Pennsylvania and, uh, they're not happy about the taxes that are being levied against them, and they're not happy about some of this back pay that still hasn't been paid to them. And so they take up arms. It doesn't really go very far, but it really shakes people. Because there's a rebellion and the American government has a lot of trouble dealing with it. And so people see for the first time, wow, people like Washington and Hamilton are right. Uh, this is really a bad thing that our government can't respond to crises when they adopt. So, uh, it leads to a lot of lost sleep for the continental Congress. And. And has a big part in shifting American public opinion towards the idea. Yeah, we do need something new.

{"text": "Uh , technically when it starts , the constitutional convention is illegal . People are plotting a new government as there ' s an existing government are already there . Uh , but you know , what are they going to do about it ? Uh , that ' s George Washington: the whole point is that the American government is so weak. They don't have a standing army. They don't have any forces with which they can stop this. And you know, they, they didn't care that much. The continental Congress, many of the people who served in it would serve in the constitutional convention and they do end up passing a bill, uh, belatedly that says, okay, uh, this constitutional convention is okay, even though it ends up. Stepping beyond, uh, the, the powers that continental Congress gave it. Virginia names Washington as their chief representative to the constitutional Congress without consulting him. And at first Washington considers turning this down because he had made a promise when he left the military in 1783, that he was done with public life. And he wanted to set the example that I'm not going to become a tyrant. I'm not going to try and take power for myself. My public service is done. I'm going to go back to being a gentleman farmer. So he is nominated, but he considers turning it down for this reason. He didn't want to break a promise, but ultimately he decides, okay, well, this thing actually might fail, uh, without my presence and we really need this. And so I'm going to answer the call of duty one more time. And he goes. To, and he goes to the constitutional convention to help hammer out, figure out what should our new constitution be. He has, uh, his same approach that he always uses. I I think that Chernow writes something really interesting about his approach. He says, having learned to accumulate power by withholding his ascent, he understood the influence of his having learned to accumulate power. By withholding his ascent, he understood the influence of his mystique and kept people in suspense. Okay, so that's one of the things he's doing is. Uh, keeping people in suspensing and maybe I'll go, maybe I won't and staying aloof and staying mysterious, having this mystique about him. I think that's one of the big lessons that I am taking away from this whole story is, you know, especially in the time of social media, people want to be so present. People want to put more and more out there. And in some ways, absence is really powerful. Like if you're listening to a song and you hear a few seconds of silence, you go. What just", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/george-washington", "title": "George Washington", "chunk_index": 74, "publication_date": "2024-05-03", "total_chunks_in_doc": 96}}
{"text": "people want to be so present . People want to put more and more out there . And in some ways , absence is really powerful . Like if you ' re listening to a song and you hear a few seconds of silence , you go . What just George Washington: happened there in a noisy world, silence is a superpower. Silence actually calls more attention than noise does. And so that's something I learned from this. That's something I've been thinking about is how do I cultivate that mystique? Um, how do I cultivate that mystique? There's actually a good, how do I cultivate that mystique? There's actually a good scene from one of my favorite TV shows called the young Pope, where, uh, I think this is explained really well. And the young Pope is the story of. A Pope who gets elected and is very young is played by Jude law. And he comes in and one of the first things that happens is the marketing director of the Vatican says, Okay, we need an official portrait for you so that we can, you know, publish all these plates and pictures and all this memorabilia and merchandise with the image of the Pope on it. So, uh, what, what portrait do you want to use? And here is what the Pope played by Jude Law says about his portrait. okay. And I think that really gets at it. George Washington created this mystique by being inaccessible. Um, and that led to this frenzy to get him involved, get his attention. And so I think that's something that a lot of people. And so I think that's something that can definitely be learned from. When he gets to the constitutional convention, they want a president to preside over the thing. The only people considered are him and Benjamin Franklin. And Benjamin Franklin actually nominates George Washington to be the president of the constitutional convention. One, so that there's not conflict. The last thing that either of them want is for this to devolve into petty partisanship. And then the other thing is Benjamin Franklin is older than Washington and his health is not great at that point. So he doesn't think he has the energy to be the president. So he nominates Washington, uh, despite Franklin Washington, really wanting this to be nonpartisan, non contentious. It does get very contentious. You know, there are different states with different interests, different ideas about how this new constitution should look, and it gets very, very heated for a while. Washington himself tries to stay above it all. , here's a good quote. Most of the time he stood forth as a neutral arbiter and honest broker. Okay. So that's all he's trying to do. Arbitrate, be an honest", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/george-washington", "title": "George Washington", "chunk_index": 75, "publication_date": "2024-05-03", "total_chunks_in_doc": 96}}

Arbitrate , be an honest George Washington: broker, gather all the views, synthesize, and kind of keep people moving forward productively. Uh, Uh, this whole thing happens in Philadelphia. And so as an attempt. To seem like a neutral party, who's inclusive of everyone, who is inclusive of everyone. One of the things he does is he goes to many different churches in Philadelphia. And he attends different services, showing that, you know, religiously, he's kind of a man of all seasons, a man for all people. He even, he doesn't go to church with him, but he goes to a dinner with one of the prominent Jewish merchants. And he goes to a Catholic Mass. So he's showing that, Hey, it doesn't matter if you are, Episcopalian or Presbyterian or Catholic or Jewish, you know, I can get along with you. And I want all of you involved in this new American project. One of the other things that's interesting to me is a lot of people, when they meet Washington, they want to go down memory lane. You know, they want to talk about the victories of the revolutionary war. And all the successes that he had had and all the experiences they'd had in Washington did not like to do that. Uh, Uh, here's the quotes is active and forward looking Washington did not amble very often down memory lane. And that's a really common attribute of great men of great. And that's a really common attribute of the greats, you know, whether it was Steve jobs who hated talking about his childhood, Edison was the same. Like they don't like to look backwards. They only like to look forward. And that might seem like a small thing, but to me, I mean, just consider how different the course of America would have been if Washington had used this constitutional convention as an opportunity to replay the hits. If he had been consumed with what he had already accomplished, but he wasn't, he was forward looking. He had everyone focused on this new constitution and that leads to some great results. One of the biggest contributions that Washington makes to the new constitution is just his presence because they're talking about three branches of government from the very beginning. This is called the Virginia plan. And so they have a legislative branch and executive branch and a judicial branch. And the executive branch, people are very skeptical of, because, again, they're really afraid of tyranny,", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/george-washington", "title": "George Washington", "chunk_index": 76, "publication_date": "2024-05-03", "total_chunks_in_doc": 96}}
{"text": "from the very beginning . This is called the Virginia plan . And so they have a legislative branch and executive branch and a judicial branch . And the executive branch , people are very skeptical of , because , again , they ' re really afraid of tyranny , George Washington: of an English model of government, so they don't want anyone that looks like a monarch, or who has a lot of power centralized in a single person. And so, if Washington wasn't there, the executive would have been very, very weak. And it would have been a sclerotic, I think, and weak government that couldn't get much done. However, because Washington is there, when people are talking about and thinking about the executive, they are thinking about Washington. In Washington, everyone trusts because he had voluntarily put down power. He had never tried to get more power for himself. And he's just an incredibly trustworthy character. And so with him in their mind, here's the quote. This is true now. He says that the delegates overcame their dread of executive power and produced an energetic presidency. Can be traced directly to Washington's imperturbable presence. Pierce Butler doubted that the presidential powers would have been so great. Had not many members cast their eyes towards general Washington as president and shape their ideas of the powers to a president by their opinion of his virtue. With his image before their eyes, the delegates were inevitably governed by their hopes. Instead of their fears. And so, you know, the constitution as written does have a pretty strong executive branch, a much stronger than many were thinking without Washington's presence. Uh, this process of the constitutional convention. A lot of compromises have to be arrived at. No one loves what comes out of it because of these compromises. But I think it's interesting, uh, here's another Chernow quote. He says, Whatever his misgivings about individual provisions, Washington was no lukewarm supporter of the final document. And so they come out with this document, with this constitution, and Washington, Strongly supports it. And I think there's this temptation, uh, for many people to not strongly support something that they don't 100 percent agree with. And I think it takes a lot of bravery to, to take something, whether that's a document, a constitution or a product, and you might not love everything about it, but You helped create it and you're a supporter of it and champion it anyways. And that's what he does. This constitution, he might not have loved everything that went into it. He puts aside his misgivings about individual provisions and as a strong supporter and works hard to get it passed, you know, without Washington's presence, I", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/george-washington", "title": "George Washington", "chunk_index": 77, "publication_date": "2024-05-03", "total_chunks_in_doc": 96}}
{"text": "s what he does . This constitution , he might not have loved everything that went into it . He puts aside his misgivings about individual provisions and as a strong supporter and works hard to get it passed , you know , without Washington ' s presence , I George Washington: don't think that the Washington, you know, without Washington's presence, I don't think that the constitution. Would have passed. I don't think it would have been ratified by all the states. Certainly not the constitution that the United States eventually did adopt. And in fact, Washington kind of doesn't want to be the first president. Yeah, he really does just want to be done with all this public service. Uh, but many of the people, especially one governor Morris, I think he's the governor of New York says to Washington, look, dude, if you make it known that you're not going to be the first president. This constitution is not going to pass. People aren't going to ratify it. You're the only person that people trust to not take power for yourself. And so Washington does basically get kind of forced into running as first president of the United States of America. He doesn't campaign. He can't campaign because he doesn't campaign for the presidency. He kind of can't, his hands are kind of bound because. You know, that's his whole brand. This is the guy who doesn't want to take power. Uh, but it doesn't matter. No one really runs against him. There's not a lot of debate. And in the first ever election for president of the United States, Washington receives all the electoral votes. He wins in a landslide unanimously. You know, Flexner points out that it's a good thing that he didn't have to run for president because he wouldn't have been a very good candidate. He wasn't a very good politician. Here's what he says. With his rather formal personality, Washington was lucky that he didn't need to engage in electioneering. For he lacked the requisite skills for such campaigning. Had he been forced to make speeches or debate on the stump, he would not have fared very well. And I think this is something a lot of people who are interested in the political sphere could learn from.

That way you ' re a blank canvas that people can kind of project their hopes onto . It ' s George Washington: something Washington does very well. So in 1788, George Washington is elected as the first ever president of the United States of America. He is 56 years old and immediately he starts setting precedent that would become important for how the United States would function. The first thing he does is at the inauguration, he decides not to wear his military uniform, thereby emphasizing that there is civilian control over the United States and that he's not taking power as a military leader, but as a. as a civilian one, as an elected official. It's funny how slapdash his entire inauguration is, because this had never been done. There are no rules, there are no precedents. So, for example, the constitution sets out that he should take an oath of office, and at the last minute, People putting it on decide, well, he should swear on the Bible, but there is no Bible where they're, where they're doing the inauguration. So they have to run over to a Masonic lodge and just grab a random Bible. And that's the one that he, uh, that he swears on, you know, you know, the other thing to realize, I mean, this is just such a crazy situation, something that I had not thought about when George Washington takes over as president of the United States, it's literally just him. He is the entire executive branch. Of the federal government. And even for the first few months, his presidential staff is smaller than his household staff. Uh, here's the quote from Chernow at its inception, the executive branch was extraordinarily small. Washington initially oversaw a larger staff of slaves and servants at Mount Vernon than he did as president of the United States, but the new government quickly overshadowed his estate in size. So it does quickly grow, but he has to decide everything. About what the executive government, but he has to decide everything about what the executive branch is going to look like. And that's an incredibly difficult thing. To figure out how do I go about creating a government from scratch? And, you know, over the years, the presidency has changed, especially you think about Abraham Lincoln kind of reshaped the American presidency. So did Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, FDR. But even through all those changes, the institution of the presidency of the United States still maintains the imprint of George Washington. A ton of the precedents that he set still stand. And it's amazing to think about that legacy", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/george-washington", "title": "George Washington", "chunk_index": 79, "publication_date": "2024-05-03", "total_chunks_in_doc": 96}}

A ton of the precedents that he set still stand . And it ' s amazing to think about that legacy George Washington: that's lasting, you know, a couple hundred years later. It's amazing to think about that legacy that's lasting 250 years later. Now, just to give you an idea of, of what a challenge this is at first, he can't get any work done because similar to his time at Mount Vernon, people are just coming to see him all day. And petition him and meet him. And again, he kind of thinks as a Republican leader, uh, as a, as a leader of a democratic country, he can't turn down anyone. So he's just taking meetings with random people all day, every day. And eventually he says, look, this is not working. And so he had, and so he creates special times when people come to meet with him. He'll come down, shake their hand, say hello, and then go back to getting work done. Uh, Uh, the first thing he does is set up a staff. And so he makes his first few crucial hires. And I think this is the real key to the Washington presidency is the team that he puts around him. So initially, uh, there are only three departments of the United States. So there is the treasury department, the state department. And the war department and for his three leaders, he gets Thomas Jefferson as his first secretary of state. Okay. So he's handling international relations as his first treasury secretary . He gets Alexander Hamilton. So he's in charge of all the finances of the United States. And then as his war secretary, he gets a general who had served with him in the revolutionary war named Henry Knox. And it's kind of interesting because he only has these three departments. Uh, They kind of take on random duties a lot of time, especially Hamilton. Hamilton is very active and, , has a strong vision for how the government should look. So any kind of random initiatives end up getting sucked under Hamilton. So he's got these three really strong leaders. They're brilliant, and that's the first thing. But they have strong personalities, and they're definitely not easy to manage. And so I think it's interesting to take a look at how he did that. Here's a really good quote from Chernow. He says, Thomas Jefferson, the first Secretary of State, would dub Washington the hub of the wheel, with the department heads arrayed like brilliant spokes around", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/george-washington", "title": "George Washington", "chunk_index": 80, "publication_date": "2024-05-03", "total_chunks_in_doc": 96}}
{"text": "to take a look at how he did that . Here ' s a really good quote from Chernow . He says , Thomas Jefferson , the first Secretary of State , would dub Washington the hub of the wheel , with the department heads arrayed like brilliant spokes around George Washington: him. In choosing those heads, Washington surrounded himself with a small but decidedly stellar group. With his own renown secure, he had no fear that subordinates would upstage him and never wanted subservient courtiers whom he could overshadow. He excelled as a leader precisely because he was able to choose and orchestrate bright, strong personalities. So the way that he does this, the way that he orchestrates these strong, bright personalities, is one, he takes his time. Okay, there's a bunch of quotes about this. Uh, he, he, there are a bunch of quotes about this, uh, that are good, but he wanted to hear every side of the issue. And he wanted to take his time before deciding on, on anything. That way, he didn't let himself get bowled over by men who were, frankly, a little bit smarter than him. Okay, so he takes into account every viewpoint and really takes his time to understand the issue before making a decision. Another thing he does, another thing he does is make sure that he hears dissenting voices. So, he set a very cordial tone, a collegiality, so it's open, it's kind of friendly, and people really felt like they could make their voices heard uninhibited, and they weren't going to be, you know, smacked down or, Punished for voicing an unpopular view. Another good quote says, Through his tolerant attitude, he created a protective canopy under which subordinates could argue freely, but, and I think this is the third key, once decisions were made. He wanted the administration to speak with one voice. So internally, lots of dissent, externally, no dissent. That was one of his rules. He hated disloyalty and really punished it. So internally, yes. Argue strongly. Externally, we are a united front and, uh, and you don't get to air any grievances once a decision has been made. And then the last thing is, yes, we're going to take a while in decision making, but once the decision is made, we are going to act fast. And we're going to act strong. Uh, the actual quote is deliberate maturely, but execute promptly and vigorously. And I think that that is, and I think that that is a really smart way to approach things. Take as much time as you need to decide, take as much time as you need to come to the right decision.

But once you decided execute quickly , And vigorously , George Washington: as he says. It's worth digging a little more into the Hamilton relationship. Here's a good long quote from Chernow, who calls him Washington's unofficial prime minister. Chernow says, At a time when politicians were supposed to be self effacing, Hamilton was openly ambitious, and in many respects the antithesis of Washington. Where Washington had no compulsion to shine and company, Hamilton, who was charming, urbane, and debonair, wanted to be the most brilliant figure in every group. And he usually was. A prolific writer of letters, essays, and pamphlets, he was a systematic thinker who knew how to translate principles into workable policies. Hamilton saw the advantage of setting a brisk tempo to the administration and pushing through quickly an ambitious legislative package, for future administrations he wanted to capitalize on the short lived goodwill granted to a new president. Okay, so Hamilton kind of realizes, hey, we got all this goodwill, all these people love Washington right now, We've got this golden opportunity to implement a lot of stuff and we got to do it now. And we got to do it quickly. And so the amount of stuff that they pass really is breathtaking. One of the first things that they do is pass this legislative. One of the first things they do is assume the state debt, which was not popular with a number of states. But, A lot of these states had racked up debt during the Revolutionary War, and they had done that by issuing bonds. So you got all these outstanding, so you got all these outstanding bonds, and they are held by mostly Americans, just American citizens. And so they're paying interest, all these bonds. And, so Washington and Hamilton have this idea that the federal government is going to go buy all of this debt so that it becomes American debt. And it seems kind of like a I don't know, like a bureaucratic, and it seems kind of just like, I don't know, a bureaucratic, and it seems just kind of like a bureaucratic move, right? Uh, it's, you have still have the same amount of debt. It was just held by the States. Now it's held by the central government, just different layer of government. But behind this seemingly mundane change was a very profound difference, which is you have all these Americans who are used to doing transactions with their states. So they're holding this debt, they're getting payments. From their state governments.

{"text": ". But behind this seemingly mundane change was a very profound difference , which is you have all these Americans who are used to doing transactions with their states . So they ' re holding this debt , they ' re getting payments . From their state governments . Now George Washington: they're getting payments from the federal government that increases their reliance on this federal government, their familiarity with it. And makes them more comfortable doing business with this brand new government. And so it seems like a little thing, but it's really crucial. And that is one of the things Hamilton was great at and that Washington saw and encouraged him to do was, what actions can we take? that seem small, that seem unthreatening, but have, uh, a really profound impact when they're played out. Another thing that Hamilton, another thing that Washington pushes through, uh, through Hamilton is a central bank. And this, and this is really unpopular with, uh, especially southern states. They hated the idea of, uh, a national bank. It was based on the model of the Bank of England. I was like, it is very obviously and explicitly based on the Bank of England. In fact, when Hamilton is drawing up the Bank of America, in fact, when Hamilton is drawing up the Central Bank for America, he has the Articles of Incorporation for the Bank of England. On one hand, he's kind of just copying them over. Like it's very explicitly one for one copying this model. And so all these Southern states are like, we just tried to get away from this system of government. But it's really important for generating the, but it's really important for generating the capital needed to form this new federal government. And it works. Uh, there are definitely some ups and downs, some complications, there's some, uh, bank runs, you know, a bunch of boom and bust for buying and selling these, uh, a bunch of boom and bust, a bunch of boom and bust for buying and selling these bonds issued by the new central bank. But at the end of it, Washington's assessment, which is true is our public credit stands on that ground, which three years ago it would have been considered as a species of madness. To have foretold. Okay. So the, the credit worthiness of the United States skyrockets through the creation of this central bank. Washington and Hamilton also have to implement an entirely new taxation system, and of course people don't like being taxed. It's kind of unpopular, but extremely necessary. And only Washington has the public goodwill and has the gravitas to implement this without too much of a, without too much resistance. And I say too much resistance. It did", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/george-washington", "title": "George Washington", "chunk_index": 83, "publication_date": "2024-05-03", "total_chunks_in_doc": 96}}
{"text": "t like being taxed . It ' s kind of unpopular , but extremely necessary . And only Washington has the public goodwill and has the gravitas to implement this without too much of a , without too much resistance . And I say too much resistance . It did George Washington: in fact lead eventually to a small rebellion called the whiskey rebellion. And so it's not like it went over without any hiccups. Uh, but the point is. This Whiskey Rebellion was in fact quite small and was easily put down and so they are able to implement a whole new taxation structure. Anyway, there are a bunch of other stuff. I can't go through every single policy initiative. The whole point is that through all of this they really unleash the power of the United States, especially as an industrial power on the world stage. One of the things that Washington does is he doesn't want to be ensconced in this bubble where he doesn't really know how popular his initiatives are and what people are thinking. So first he goes on a tour of new England because you know, the North was not his home. He didn't know it as well. So he's meeting people. He's talking with common people saying, you know, what do you think of this stuff? And then once they pass this ambitious legislative package, he goes to the South. Where it was most unpopular, and he's able to talk with people there, conciliate, and kind of get their viewpoint on all this stuff that has gone through. So, these tours Of the North and South where he can talk with people who are outside of his bubble and get their viewpoints are crucial to his model for, uh, uh, properly functioning government and administration. Now, throughout this first term, it starts as a, a good unified group, but as time goes on, there start to be very. Deep, but as time goes on there are really deep fissures between Hamilton and Jefferson. So Jefferson is a committed ideologue He's a democratic republican at this time There are no now as this administration goes along at first it's united because but it so as this administration goes along It starts pretty united, but over time it becomes very And that's because his two main department heads are very divided. Uh, at the time there are no political parties, but they would develop because of this essentially. So on the one hand you have Hamilton, who is strongly in favor of a strong central government, who's in favor of industrial interests, who's in favor of the United States becoming an economic powerhouse. And on the other hand, you have Jefferson, who is a member of what would become the Democratic Republican Party. So he's very strongly in favor", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/george-washington", "title": "George Washington", "chunk_index": 84, "publication_date": "2024-05-03", "total_chunks_in_doc": 96}}

And on the other hand , you have Jefferson , who is a member of what would become the Democratic Republican Party . So he ' s very strongly in favor George Washington: of agrarian interests. He's very skeptical of a strong central government. And more sides with southern interests. Jefferson and Hamilton eventually become, Jefferson and Hamilton are increasingly at each other's throats. Until the point where, towards the end of his first term, Jefferson says to Washington that, uh, he thinks Hamilton has a plan that is intended to, quote, prepare the way for a change from the present republican form of government to that of a monarchy, of which the English constitution is to be the model. And Washington tells Jefferson essentially, like, Dude, grow up. What are you talking about? Washington tells him, I don't think there are 10 people of repute in the United States who legitimately favor a con who legitimately favor a monarchy. And so this creates a fracture that can never fully be recovered. And so early in his second administration, Washington is reelected in 1792. Jefferson leaves. The administration and, um, Jefferson leaves the administration and, uh, is no longer associated with Washington and the federal government, you know, things are already heated between the democratic Republicans and Hamilton's party, which comes to be known as the Federalists, and then everything gets turned to the Democrats. You know, from a five to a nine by the French revolution, colors, everything in Washington's second term. And that is because Washington who is increasingly becoming affiliated with the Federalists, uh, was very apprehensive of the French revolution. Whereas the democratic Republicans really embraced it. Uh, here's the quote while Washington grew increasingly apprehensive about the violent events in Paris, Jefferson viewed them with philosophical serenity, lecturing Lafayette. that one couldn't travel from despotism to liberty in a feather bed. Unlike Washington, Jefferson regarded the French Revolution as the proud and inevitable sequel to the American Revolution. And Washington, you actually get to see kind of a preview of His excellent judgment, because he looks at this burgeoning French revolution and he says, uh, this thing is going to get more and more violent is going to get out of control. And it's going to lead to the demise of King Louis. Initially, you know, the thought was maybe this will just become a constitutional monarchy and, uh, it'll become a moderate Republican form of government, uh, Washington says, I don't see that happening. Jefferson, on the other hand, predicted quote, I think it pro Jefferson, on the other hand, predicted quote, I think it probable this country will", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/george-washington", "title": "George Washington", "chunk_index": 85, "publication_date": "2024-05-03", "total_chunks_in_doc": 96}}

Jefferson , on the other hand , predicted quote , I think it pro Jefferson , on the other hand , predicted quote , I think it probable this country will George Washington: within two or three years be in the enjoyment of a tolerably free constitution that with Jefferson on the other hand predicted for france He said I think it probable this country will within two or three years Be in the enjoyment of a tolerably free constitution and that without its having cost them a single drop of blood Okay, so you see Like how wrong he was And it just throws into contrast how prescient Washington was, how good his judgment was that he could see all of this coming. So you have the situation where the Federalists led by Washington and Hamilton are trying hard to remain neutral. They don't want any entangling alliances. They don't want to pick between England and France. Whereas the democratic Republicans say, Hey, you know, we just had a Republican revolution. The French who are having a Republican revolution, these are our brothers in arms. These are our comrades. You know, we should support them. And it's really tough for Washington to remain neutral. So there's one incident where the ambassador that France sends is named a citizen's DNA. And this guy is like, yeah, man, United States is totally gonna be on our side. You know, they just had this revolution. We're having a revolution, same, same. We're totally on the same team. And so he takes liberties that are completely inappropriate. When French ships. When French privateers take British ships, he has them brought to American ports where they are refitted as friendships and sent out to battle. And so the French are trying to use American ports as like a base of military operations against the English. and Washington is, is very strongly against this and it's being encouraged by all these people who are democratic Republicans. You know, this eventually evolves into essentially a red scare. It's actually amazing. You know, they say history doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme. And here's one instance where it really rhymes because you have this, because you have this revolutionary leftist government. In France, that is sort of international in its outlook. Right. And so you have the leftist party in the United States that supports it. And it's just like the red scare, you know, in, uh, and it's just like the situation with the Soviets in the 20th century, where you do have a lot of people on the left side of the spectrum of American politics who support communism, who support. We support communism who support, you", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/george-washington", "title": "George Washington", "chunk_index": 86, "publication_date": "2024-05-03", "total_chunks_in_doc": 96}}

We support communism who support , you George Washington: know, socialist ideals in the United States, and then you have this really strong reaction against that and against anything affiliated with it on the American right. And so what you eventually have is Adams, John Adams. Who is the next president is a federalist and he, uh, passes something called the alien and seditions act, which makes it difficult for foreigners, but especially it was targeted at French people, makes it difficult for the French to become American citizens. And it shuts down, uh, democratic, uh, And it shuts down Republican newspapers that, uh, that's, you know, criticize the government and we're speaking in favor of, you know, French style ideals. It's just like the same thing as the 1950s Red Scare of Adam saying, yeah, this is not legitimate opposition. Uh, he thinks that this is international influence in American affairs. In fact, Adams becomes convinced that if the French were to attack the United States, people like Jefferson and James Madison, who were strong Democratic Republicans, would form a fifth column and help the French to take over the United States. And, uh, I think this is kind of a fevered imagination of John Adams. In the same way that Thomas Jefferson suggesting that Hamilton wanted to implement a monarchy is ridiculous, I think this The idea that Jefferson, who had fought so hard for American independence would give that up for French control of America is also ridiculous, but I think it just shows the hyper partisanship that everyone suspected each other, not just a differing viewpoints, actual, but of actual disloyalty. It's just like today where people on the left side of the spectrum say, Hey, uh, Donald Trump is actually controlled by Russia. And if Donald Trump is elected, it's going to lead to fascism. And then, you know, on the far right, you also, uh, have people on the right side of the spectrum saying of Democrats, you know, they're globalists, they're not loyal to America, they don't, they're not patriotic. , and so everyone suspects each other, not just of differences of opinion, but of actual bad faith. Washington is. Able to stay above this for a certain amount of time. , but especially once Jefferson leaves his administration, he says, you know, I can't get along with Hamilton anymore. You're basically passing all of Hamilton's initiatives. I don't want to be associated with this government", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/george-washington", "title": "George Washington", "chunk_index": 87, "publication_date": "2024-05-03", "total_chunks_in_doc": 96}}

You ' re basically passing all of Hamilton ' s initiatives . I don ' t want to be associated with this government George Washington: anymore. And it's a big blow to Washington when he leaves because Jefferson, whatever, you know, differences of opinion they might've had, he's extremely gifted, extremely intelligent, and a really gifted diplomat who was very capably able to manipulate. Who was very capable in implementing foreign policy and all that stuff. So it's a big blow to Washington's. So it's a big blow to Washington's administration when Jefferson leaves. And also he can't manage to find another Southern democratic Republican to take his place. And so he has to pull in another federalist. And so all of a sudden it seems like, yeah, Washington doesn't really stand above all this anymore. He's really a federalist. He won't admit to it. He's partisan, just like everyone else. One of the last things to happen to make him seem really partisan is he passes something called the Jay Treaty. So John Jay, who's an American diplomat negotiates this treaty with England, ends up being called the Jay Treaty. And then the Congress And then the Senate passes it, the legislative branch, but you know, it's still basically Washington's thing and what this treaty did and what this treaty was, was an agreement with the British. And so what it did is, um, um, it agreed on a trade deal, a very good trade deal for the United States. It got the British to remove their forts from North America as well. So that's also a great for the United States, but. In some ways, the British had kinda out negotiated John Jay, because the trade deal was, in many ways, very favorable, uh, to, to Great Britain, It didn't stop the impressment of US soldiers. I won't get into all that, but anyways, there's some stuff that doesn't go into the treaty that a lot of people wanted in it. And so, uh, the democratic Republicans see this as Washington siding with the English over the French. And they're incensed. They're like, Hey, the French just helped us in this revolutionary war. These are our allies. They stand up for Republican ideals, just like the United States does.

And when the J treaty passes, instead of him trying to assuage the French government and say, no, look, we were just signing this deal in order to resolve some things and get on good terms with the English, but we also want to be on good terms with you guys. Instead. He takes to the streets with the French and he's like, yeah, can you believe what Washington did? This guy is supposed to be serving under Washington and he's actively undermining him in France. Of course, he's recalled and fired from the Washington administration, but the damage in large part is done. And so in this environment, you know, in his first administration, Washington, he's such a national hero. He's able to avoid public criticism in his second administration, in his second term. Uh, the Democratic Republicans really come after him and they have all these newspapers and they're sniping at him and nothing is off limits, you know, they're doing the classic, they're doing the classic tabloid thing, uh, they're digging up everything, they're making really personal attacks on him, in fact, they go back. And they attack. In fact, they go back and they dig up the Jumanville incident. If you remember that thing where Washington accidentally kills the wrong Frenchmen and it sets off this international incident, they, they bring that back up and say that he assassinated a man under a flag of truce and they play it up in, in the worst terms possible. And you can see how petty things get by the end of his administration. In one particular story that I think is interesting after Washington's farewell address, federalists in the Virginia house of delegates, Introduced a motion that hailed Washington for his quote, virtue, patriotism, and wisdom. And the Republicans in Virginia, you know, they have to be kind of passive aggressive about it because Washington still is a national hero, despite all of this. But they lobby to have the word wisdom removed from the resolution basically saying like, oh, yeah, no one can question Washington's virtue and patriotism. Oh his wisdom. I'm not sure about that.

But, you know, I think that was a little bit naive because at the end of the day, parts of the United States were divided in terms of what they wanted. And so no amount of saying, Hey guys, let's stick to it together can overcome the fact that there are different interests for different groups And so this opposition is one of the reasons that. And so this, this, and so this opposition, this division is one of the reasons that Washington decides to step down after just two terms, eight years as president of the United States of America. Another reason that he decides to step down is his health. Um, his health is, is bad. So. His teeth had started to rot in his twenties, uh, but by the end of his presidency, he had no natural teeth remaining. So he had to wear these dentures. The dentures were really uncomfortable. Remember, this is 1700s technology. So they are made out of metal, uh, and then the teeth are made out of ivory and, um, and actually human teeth from poor people and slaves, uh, that would be bought. Um, these dentures are incredibly uncomfortable. They scratch. Uh, his gums when he talks or when he opens his mouth, it made speech really difficult and his gums were just often inflamed and infected and really painful. He also has other health scares. He develops pneumonia at one point. He has a recurring tumor in his leg that makes him very sick and, uh, and has to be drained from time to time. His hearing was going, his eyesight was going. He was in his sixties. So he's not that old, but he had lived a really hard life and a very stressful life and had taken its toll on him. And so he was aging very quickly in the sixties. His health was not good. And so he didn't want to continue to subject himself to that. He wanted to be free of the presidency. And so he does, he steps down after two terms.

{"text": "election after his presidency . It ' s a remarkable run . Uh , I ' m just going to read at length actually from Chernow . I think he has a great summary . It was kind of long , but I think it ' s a great summary George Washington: of what Washington was able to accomplish in eight years. You know, the thing that really stands out to me is just forming a federal government. Is accomplishment enough. There's no precedent. There's nothing to do. Like just forming this whole bureaucratic structure from the ground up is a huge accomplishment. Anything beyond that is gravy. You know, any initiatives, any actual initiatives. It's amazing that he could do that as well. And yet there were many things that he did accomplish. And so let's, uh, let's read some of that turnout rights. Washington had forged the executive branch of the federal government appointed outstanding department heads and set a benchmark for fairness, efficiency, and integrity. That future administrations would aspire to match Washington's catalog of accomplishments was simply breathtaking. He had restored American credit and assumed state debt, created a bank, a mint, a coast guard, a custom service, and a diplomatic corps introduced the first accounting tax and budgetary procedures, maintained peace at home and abroad, inaugurated a Navy, bolstered the army. and shored up coastal defenses and infrastructure, proved that the country could regulate commerce and negotiate binding treaties, protected frontier settlers, subdued Indian uprisings, and established law and order amid rebellion, scrupulously adhering all the while to the letter of the Constitution. During his successful presidency, exports had soared, shipping had boomed, and state taxes had declined dramatically. Washington had also opened the Mississippi to commerce, negotiated treaties with the Barbary states, and forced the British to evacuate their northwestern forts. Most of all, he had shown a disbelieving world that a Republican government could prosper without being spineless or disorderly or reverting to authoritarian rule. So, you know, I think to understand how successful His first presidency. So I think to understand how successful his presidency was, you just have to look to the French example and the French revolution, you know, the French revolution is a total mess in terms of how it's managed until Napoleon takes over and once Napoleon takes over, he's an amazing reformer, gets the French government really in shape, gets the French government really in shape. But, you know, because of his temperament, uh, leads to all this violent. It leads to all this violence, and to his eventual overthrow, and just multiple decades of chaos. With Washington, you get something like the Napoleonic Reformation, but without any of the chaos. And so it's just smooth sailing for the United States. And to what extent", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/george-washington", "title": "George Washington", "chunk_index": 91, "publication_date": "2024-05-03", "total_chunks_in_doc": 96}}
{"text": "violence , and to his eventual overthrow , and just multiple decades of chaos . With Washington , you get something like the Napoleonic Reformation , but without any of the chaos . And so it ' s just smooth sailing for the United States . And to what extent George Washington: is Washington responsible for all this? Because many people will just say, That Hamilton was actually the one responsible. And people said that at the time, you know, the democratic Republicans definitely accused Washington of just being a marionette and that Hamilton was the one behind him, pulling all the strings. It was all of his ideas that were being implemented. And while it's true that Hamilton hatched a lot of these ideas. You know, Jefferson had a lot of ideas too. The reason that all this stuff was implemented is because fundamentally Washington had had the same experience as Hamilton in the continental army. And so they had a similar viewpoint. And so he agreed with Hamilton and he enabled him and he served as a check on him. Uh, Uh, he used his judgment. to pick and choose of what Hamilton put forward and saw that it was implemented. You know, it was only Washington that had the stature to actually get this stuff through. If Hamilton himself had been president, you know, the, the, if Hamilton himself had been president, the suspicion, From the democratic republicans would have been so strong either a none of the stuff would have been passed or b There would have been a civil war very early in the life of the united states of america And you can actually see that it wasn't just you know, A genius Hamilton as the man behind the curtains and Washington as a paper leader by what happened after they parted. Regarding Hamilton, here's a good quote from Chernow, I think. He says he began a long tragic descent. He had achieved his most stellar feats under Washington's benign auspices and seemed to lose his moral compass when When he no longer operated under his direct guidance for all his brilliance, Hamilton's judgment was as erratic as Washington's seemed unerring. And so Hamilton and Washington really were kind of the founding partnership of the United States. And it was Hamilton's brilliance with Washington's unerring judgment, you know, his just unbelievable ability to maybe think slower, but always make the right decision that led to these awesome outcomes. And, and I think Hamilton's lack of accomplishment without Washington shows just how necessary he was for that to happen. After his presidency, once again, Washington tries to go home, be a gentleman farmer. Once again, he is kind of pulled into public service for a little bit. Uh, what happens is that when John Adams is president, Again, uh, you know, there's kind of this", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/george-washington", "title": "George Washington", "chunk_index": 92, "publication_date": "2024-05-03", "total_chunks_in_doc": 96}}

Uh , what happens is that when John Adams is president , Again , uh , you know , there ' s kind of this George Washington: cold war Adams is really suspicious of all these democratic Republicans, all these leftists who, you know, just want to side with the communistic French. And so there is this, uh, and so there is this kind of quasi war it's actually called the quasi war is the name it's known by, but there's our naval action between France and the United States, it's called a quasi war. Cause it never breaks out into actual open warfare. It's But it sure looks like the beginning of a war. And so there's some thought that the French might try to invade the United States, or at least try to foment a new revolution. This one, not a moderate revolution like the United States had originally, but like a real, you know, rabble rousing. leftist French style, uh, uh, social revolution. And so an army is called together and John Adams asks Washington to come out of retirement to lead this army. And so Washington takes some steps, tries to get, you know, his lieutenants in order. Um, Um, however, it never actually becomes necessary. And Adams eventually signs a peace treaty with the French that ends the whole episode. So that is kind of the last real incident. of Washington's life. Washington's health continues to degrade. Um, at Mount Vernon, Washington's health continues to degrade and eventually he catches a sickness. It's an infection of the throat and he's getting sicker and sicker and it's inflaming his throat more and more until swallowing is agonizing and he's having trouble breathing. Uh, some doctors come to try and treat him and they bleed him, which was standard procedure for the time. You know, they cut him and, and drain some blood. And I always thought when I heard the story that, you know, maybe the bloodletting had some impact, but no, it was a, a huge part of his death. They took, it was like two or three liters of blood from Washington's body. Half of his blood, half the blood in his body. They end up letting out of his body, and so that incredibly weakens him to this infection, and so he continues to go downhill. You know, Washington was such a, a strong personality, was such a sturdy person, that he doesn't complain at all, despite this agonizing illness.

One of the last things he says is , quote , I feel myself going . George Washington: One of the last things he says is actually to the doctors and the slaves who are tending him. He says, quote, I feel myself going. I thank you for your attentions, but I pray you to take no more trouble about me. Let me go off quietly. I cannot last long. And I think that just says something about his personality, that selfless service, the thinking of others, the strong, resolute personality. He was who he was to the very end. You know, I think the thing that enabled so much of the great achievements of his presidency was not so much what he did, but who he was. The fact that he was so trustworthy, the fact that he didn't seek power for its own sake. That is what allowed. All of this to happen and the trust that it engendered with the citizenry with his and the trust that it engendered with the citizenry, with the legislature, with foreign governments, with everyone. He was the most trustworthy man in the world at the time. He was one of the most trustworthy men in the world. He's one of the most trustworthy men I've ever read about. And I think that is the key to Washington and to his presidency. So what did we learn? Uh, one Surround yourself with a brilliant team and enable them to do great work. By creating this open environment where views can be expressed. If you do surround yourself with people who are smarter than you, take the time to hear every viewpoint to make sure that you're not just kind of bowled over by stronger, more intelligent personalities. Another lesson I take away is use that air of mystique, that mysteriousness, that aloofness, to generate excitement and energy around what you want to accomplish. And then the last thing is just that trustworthiness that if you have that focus on a goal bigger than yourself, and you're willing to subsume your personal interests and your personal ambition to that, then it's going to draw people to you, they're going to have that trust in you, and it's going to accompl and it's going to allow you to accomplish much more than you could if you were overtly ambitious.

There are just so many independent variables. And I think one of the attractive things about sports is it is that level playing field. You control for all those variables, so to speak.

And because like Steve, and because like Steve Prefontaine, he has this infectious mindset. He was also a great leader, and even if you don't have much interest in basketball, I think he is worth studying as a leader.

By the way, if you want to learn more about Michael Jordan founders podcast has some great episodes on him.

Michael Jeffrey Jordan was born on February 17th, 1963 in Brooklyn, New York. He was raised in a small rural town in North Carolina. He was from a somewhat middle class family. Rural North Carolina was pretty poor, especially in the African American community. So yeah, like it wasn't super nice, but neither was it grinding poverty. And actually, um, a little bit later in his childhood, they would move to a somewhat bigger city in North Carolina, Wilmington, North Carolina, Michael was the fourth of five children. He had two older brothers, one older sister and one younger sister. And one of the defining relationships of his life was that with his father, he was fairly present in his life. James Jordan was a good father in many ways, but Michael really struggled to live up to his expectations. And that was. Like a fire that would burn in him for years, for his entire life. Really James Jordan had a pretty good job as a mechanic with GE. James Jordan had a pretty good job as a mechanic with GE and Michael's older brothers, Ronnie and Larry were also somewhat mechanically minded like their father. And so they would help him work on cars and do odd jobs around the house. But Michael. Was not mechanically minded at all. He had no interest in mechanical things. He was a bit like Picasso, actually. Uh, if you remember that episode, Picasso was obviously brilliant, but just absolutely could not be bothered to care about anything except for art. And he was feckless at everything else in his life could barely send a package. And Michael was very similar. It's one of the interesting attributes in his life. He's extremely hardworking when it comes to athletics. And I mean, extreme, like he was genuinely extreme in his hunger to work more and work harder. But he was also kind of extreme in the other direction. When it came to anything else, he was very lazy when it came to things like household chores. Uh, the biographer Lazenby writes, that's the laziest boy I've ever seen. James Jordan would say time and again, , If he had to get a job in a factory punching a clock, he'd starve to death. He would give every last dime of his allowance to his brothers and sisters, and even kids in the neighborhood to do his chores. He was always broke. Yet that laziness magically", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/michael-jordan", "title": "Michael Jordan", "chunk_index": 2, "publication_date": "2024-07-28", "total_chunks_in_doc": 34}}
{"text": "job in a factory punching a clock , he ' d starve to death . He would give every last dime of his allowance to his brothers and sisters , and even kids in the neighborhood to do his chores . He was always broke . Yet that laziness magically Michael Jordan: disintegrated when it came to sports. If it involved a ball in the air, a contest to be settled, the switch came on. In his adolescent mind, Michael figured maybe he could be a professional athlete. That was really about the only thing that interested him, which made him no different from millions of other daydreaming boys his age. He couldn't see how to make it that, he couldn't see how to make that happen, but rarely is there a clear or even a sane path to a life in professional sports. Okay, so that was Michael. Very driven when it came to a ball or a contest, and very lazy in just about everything else. So the line that would come to haunt Michael Jordan was, Just go on in the house with the women. Okay. So Larry and Ronnie would be helping their dad work on something in the yard and Michael would come out, but he was just useless when it came to fixing things. And so that is what annoyed. And so that is what his annoyed father would tell him. Just go on in the house with the women. Uh, here's how Michael later recounted it. Quote, my father was a mechanical person. He always tried to save money by working on everybody's cars. And my older brothers would go out and work with him. He would tell them to hand him a nine 16th wrench and they do it. I'd go out there and he'd say, give me, I'd go out there and he'd say, give me a nine 16th wrench. And I didn't know what the hell he was talking about. He used to get irritated with me and say, you don't know what the hell you're doing. Go on in there with the women. Of the millions of sentences that James Jordan uttered to his youngest son. This was the one that glowed neon bright across the decades. And Michael Jordan's responses to these kinds of slights would be a major theme of his life. It's interesting to see that it starts so early and he never really let go. Of this particular one, his relationship with his mother was much, much different. He was a mama's boy. His mom could push him a little bit later in life, you know, tell him to work a little harder. But for the most part, she was a doting mother, especially towards Michael, just, just really loved him. And it's", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/michael-jordan", "title": "Michael Jordan", "chunk_index": 3, "publication_date": "2024-07-28", "total_chunks_in_doc": 34}}

But for the most part , she was a doting mother , especially towards Michael , just , just really loved him . And it ' s Michael Jordan: interesting. I was talking with my father in law the other day, and he was talking about. Um, the Picasso episode where I mentioned this phenomenon of Picasso also had a very loving mother. And he told me about a time he was talking with a prominent basketball coach of a big college program. And he asked the, and he asked the coach what signals he looks for in a prospect. And he asked the coach what signals he looks for in a prospect to know that he would excel, stand out. And this coach said, you know, it's a funny thing, But guys who have a totally over the top, loving, doting mother and an a hole father almost always turn out to be my best players. So I look for that. And it's interesting to me because that is something that I see over and over again through these stories. From Napoleon, to Thomas Edison, to Michael Jordan. I see that trend, complicated, difficult relationships with their fathers and incredibly loving, nurturing mothers. And I do think that part of that is it's good to surround yourself with people who believe in you. And for many great achievers, that first person who believes in them and that constant presence who always believes in them throughout their entire career is their mother. And so it was an uncomplicated relationship, a very loving relationship with his mother. And like I said, very complicated with his father. You know, there are these stories like he's playing a rec league basketball game as a 12 year old, and he's on the same team as his brother, Larry. And it's a very close game. Michael steals the ball and scores the winning basket one game again, like he's 12 and his brother is 13. And so this dramatic moment of triumph for him. You know, as you can tell, he's trying to impress his father and his father's at this game and he gets, you know, the winning steel and basket. And so he's beaming and he gets in the car with his dad and his brother and all his father says is, Larry, that was great defense you played. He doesn't say anything about Michael's performance or the fact that he scored the winning, or the fact that he scored the winning basket. Okay, so this is someone who clearly, like is trying to drive his son in some way, I think, but as is so often the case with these great achievers,", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/michael-jordan", "title": "Michael Jordan", "chunk_index": 4, "publication_date": "2024-07-28", "total_chunks_in_doc": 34}}
{"text": "he scored the winning , or the fact that he scored the winning basket . Okay , so this is someone who clearly , like is trying to drive his son in some way , I think , but as is so often the case with these great achievers , Michael Jordan: Michael, you know, he doesn't shrink because of these slights. He doesn't clam up. Uh, he just gets more and more determined to do something that will finally impress his father. So I mentioned that sports was the one thing that Michael really tried hard at. At first that meant baseball. He was a good baseball player as a boy. In fact, at 12 years old, he was the best baseball player in the state. But then his talent level started to taper off and, um, he, he stopped getting better as he got older. In fact, you know, he comparatively got worse compared to the boys, his age, who were continuing to get better as he was not. And I think in part that was because he grew up before he grew out. So he wasn't super tall, um, but he was getting taller and, uh, you know, He was kind of gangly at this time in his life. So he didn't have the strength to throw or hit hard enough to be a great baseball player. But, you know, at the same time, he is becoming quite good at basketball as his baseball career is flatlining. And so finally it's in high school that he gives up on baseball and goes all in on basketball. His freshman year, he plays for the JV team. So if you're non Americans, most high schools will have a varsity team. That is the main team with the best players. And then a junior varsity team, JV. That is mostly ninth and 10th graders who aren't yet mature enough to compete at the highest level. So as a ninth grader, Michael Jordan plays on the junior varsity JV team. And he's by far the best player on that team. He really comes into his own. At this point, he's a little bit below six foot. I think over the year he grows to about six one. Okay. So that's about 185 centimeters for those of you who don't use freedom units. He's a good athlete at this point. Um, you know, he, no one has any idea that this is someone who's going to be a professional athlete, let alone a great professional athlete. A contemporary said about this period of his playing career, quote, the thing that really set him apart is he had tremendous competitiveness, that X, Y, Y chromosome in terms of competitiveness. That's maybe been his downfall", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/michael-jordan", "title": "Michael Jordan", "chunk_index": 5, "publication_date": "2024-07-28", "total_chunks_in_doc": 34}}
{"text": "a great professional athlete . A contemporary said about this period of his playing career , quote , the thing that really set him apart is he had tremendous competitiveness , that X , Y , Y chromosome in terms of competitiveness . That ' s maybe been his downfall Michael Jordan: in other areas of his life, but in basketball, that defunct. That's maybe been his downfall in other areas of his life, but in basketball, that defined him, that transcended his athleticism. Okay, so he's a good athlete. He can drive to the hoop, elevate over others. He's a good shooter. But it's really that competitive fire that defines him and that will continue to define him. Now, for a normal basketball player, usually you play on JV as a freshman and sophomore. And then you progress to varsity as a junior and senior. But for good players, it's not uncommon to jump to the varsity level for your sophomore year. That was actually my experience. I played three years of varsity basketball in high school. Yes, I'm comparing myself to Michael Jordan. No, no, my point is not that I'm as good as Michael Jordan. My point is, you know, I didn't even play college basketball. I was a good basketball player, but not a great one. My point is, like, it's pretty normal for someone who's just pretty good to make the varsity team as a sophomore. , let alone, like, Michael Jordan, right? He should have had every expectation. of playing on the varsity team as a sophomore. But when the final roster was posted for the varsity team his sophomore year, Michael Jordan's name was not on the list. And in all likelihood, the coach just wanted him to get more experience playing at the JV level. Even though Jordan was obviously better than some of the players on the varsity team, the coach probably reasoned that he would develop more as a player if he got to play for the entire game on the JV team than if he spent more than half the game sitting on the bench on the varsity team. So it's not a totally unreasonable decision, especially since Laney high school. Uh, the high school where he went did have a very talented team. The team was actually returning 14 players from the previous year. And a basketball roster is only 15 players, sometimes less, right? So, so there really wasn't a lot of room for underclassmen to make the jump. But of course, like it's Michael Jordan, right? So that's not how he's seeing it. He was furious and he was crushed that he didn't make the team as a sophomore.

He went to his Michael Jordan: room and wept and he took this as a major slight. And once again, used this. As motivation, I'll show these people who cut me from the team. Okay. So it's incredibly painful for him. Michael actually has a good quote from his autobiography about this. He says, learning is a gift, even when pain is your teacher. And I like that. I like the idea of reframing pain as a teacher. And so he was going through a lot of pain, but again, he wasn't letting it make him bitter. He was letting it teach him. Right. And that was another thing that set him apart. He was a great learner, although that wasn't always obvious, especially later in his career, but early on, it was one good story about this. I'm skipping ahead a year, but he gets recruited a year later by a college scout and that's a big moment for him, right? It shows he's got the ability to take his game to the next level. Not just be a high school player, but be a college player. And most. You know, basketball players would be trying to sway the scout, show that they really are good enough for their program. But here's what the scout says, quote, I saw a 6'3 player with explosive athletic ability. Gibbons wrote after, I saw a 6'3 player with explosive athletic ability. But what impressed me was what Michael said when Bobby introduced him to me. Mr. Gibbons, what do I need to do to be a better player? Okay, so even in this moment when he's being recruited and it's like a chance to break through and Excel, he's still just thinking about, okay, how can I learn? How can I get better? So that teachability is another thing that sets him apart. He's always looking for any possible way to elevate his game. So back to a sophomore year and that intensity, what does this new level of intensity look like for him? Uh, I like this quote from a contemporary quote. The first time I ever saw him, I had no idea who Michael Jordan was. I was helping to coach the Laney Varsity. We went over to Goldsboro, which was our big rival, and I entered the gym when the JV game was just ending up.

There were nine players on the court just coasting , but there was one kid playing his art out . Michael Jordan: But there was one kid playing his heart out. The way he was playing, I thought his team was down one point with two minutes to play. So I looked up at the clock, and his team was down 20 points, and there was only one minute to play. The way he was playing, I thought his team was down one point with two minutes to play. So I looked up at the clock, and his team was down 20 points, and there was only one minute to play. It was Michael, and I quickly learned he was always like that. Okay, so he's known for that competitive fire. So he's good as a sophomore, but he's limited by his height. Okay, and the bad news was, the genetics were not looking good. Okay, so he's about 6'1 at the end of his freshman year and he was already the tallest member of his family. His father and all his brothers were all under six feet tall. And so Michael had this tremendous anxiety about getting taller. I don't believe that you can wish your way into growing taller. But if you can, Michael Jordan is one of the few people with the strength of will to make it happen. All right, that's what I believe. Here's what Lazenby Here's what the biographer Lazenby says about . Michael Jordan's quest to grow taller. He says he spent hours hanging from a bar in the backyard, hanging anywhere on anything that afforded a good grip, trying to make himself taller. His mother had witnessed everything that had unfolded and talked with him about his anxiety. They prayed together about it, and Jordan prayed alone at the end of each day, and then he woke up in the morning, and all during the day as well. Please, Lord, make me taller. Let me grow. At 5'10 he already towered over the males in his family. Oops, cut that the prospects for that seemed slight. His parents counseled him to think about growing in his heart and in his mind. Okay. So he's literally praying morning, midday and night, and, and just thinking and meditating on getting taller and hanging from a bar, I guess, to like, try and stretch his spine to somehow get taller and, uh, and it works, you know, by the end of his junior year, he was six, four and his junior year, he was Of high school is in many ways, his", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/michael-jordan", "title": "Michael Jordan", "chunk_index": 8, "publication_date": "2024-07-28", "total_chunks_in_doc": 34}}
{"text": ", try and stretch his spine to somehow get taller and , uh , and it works , you know , by the end of his junior year , he was six , four and his junior year , he was Of high school is in many ways , his Michael Jordan: breakout year. And it's ironic considering the eventual course of his career, but the main problem his coaches had his junior year that's his first year on the varsity team. Right. Right. And the first problem that they had with him was getting him to shoot more. He was too unselfish with the ball passing too much. So his coaches had to convince him to shoot more and this works. It's good for Michael. It's good for the team. Lassenby writes at this urging, Michael began to take on more individually, which in turn revealed even more of his gift. It was then that the pattern, it was then that the pattern was established. The more he did, the more his coaches and his audience wanted him to do, and the more it began to please him to discover just what he was capable of doing. His game and his image then began to feed on themselves, still only subtly in those early days of his career. But it would soon enough come to an end. But it would soon enough become clear that everything about him was beginning to multiply. So as a junior in high school, he averages 24 points per game and 12 rebounds. And those are great numbers. So some local North Carolina scouts, , from various teams start to notice him. And he gets an invite to the nation's premier basketball camp. It's called five star. He kind of, I mean, he makes it in so, so people must think he's good. , but there's no expectations that he will stand out, right? This is the best of the best, that five star camp. And so he's not going in with buzz that, you know, Michael Jordan is going to be someone who can make a splash. He's just an attendee of the camp, but North Carolina, assistant coach, Roy Williams summarizes what happens pretty well, but. Uh, he does stand out North Carolina assistant coach Roy Williams is one of the people who sees him and here's how he summarizes what he saw. He says, Michael Jordan was clearly the best player there. He was out of sight. Michael came and he just destroyed everybody in the camp. Okay. So he doesn't come in with a big name. And one of the ways he stands out is once his workouts and games are done, he keeps sneaking back into the gym to play with other groups. And so scouts are seeing that he", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/michael-jordan", "title": "Michael Jordan", "chunk_index": 9, "publication_date": "2024-07-28", "total_chunks_in_doc": 34}}

And so scouts are seeing that he Michael Jordan: isn't just good. He had a real thirst to compete. So that camp happens in the summer between his junior and senior years. And so going into his senior year now, um, at Laney High in Wilmington, North Carolina, He's kind of a big deal now. Lots of scouts are coming to see him. Uh, he's recruited by the University of North Carolina, which had one of the great college programs in the country, and he commits to playing there before his senior year. And so he goes home now, you know, what college recruiters are saying doesn't mean much to the average person. But, uh, when people hear that you're committed to the university of North Carolina to play basketball, that does mean something. And so it's a big deal when he goes home now, he's sort of a minor celebrity. In Wilmington and everyone comes to see his games. People have to be turned away at the door because these little gyms reach their capacity. One story I love from this era is that the Crosstown rival also had a lot of great players and some of them played in the NBA. Some of them played in the NFL, just like tremendous athletes. And they play four times. That year, if I recall correctly, and, uh, Michael Jordan leads Laney to victories over this Crosstown rival in the first three matchups. Um, and then in the final one, the rival school wins and listen to what their star player had to say about it. Okay. This is the star player from the Crosstown rival. You got to understand what fuels that guy, what makes him great. He took the pain of that loss. For most people, the pain of loss is temporary. He took that loss and held onto it. It's a part of what made him. Yeah. And it made me, he beat me three times. Two of those were in my own gym. Then we win the fourth game. And to this day, I still feel bad about it. Did you catch that at the end? I still feel bad about it. I think that is one of the keys for ultra competitive types like Jordan. People can sense your will to win. They can just sense how much he wanted it, right? He wanted it more than anyone, more than anything. And so they know that you want it more than they do. And they feel bad about beating you. And I think that makes a", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/michael-jordan", "title": "Michael Jordan", "chunk_index": 10, "publication_date": "2024-07-28", "total_chunks_in_doc": 34}}

And they feel bad about beating you . And I think that makes a Michael Jordan: difference. Some small voice in the back of their brain is telling them you want it more than they do. And so they will feel bad if they win because you want it more. So do you think Michael Jordan would have ever said that about a win? I still feel bad about it. Like, of course not. Right. Of course not. Because winning meant everything to him. And so I do think, um, there's something to be said for just Wanting it so much that people, even your competitors in small, maybe subconscious ways, like kind of conspire. To help you win in little ways. It's not going to work out every time. Didn't for Jordan who lost this final game. Um, but it works out more often than it doesn't. Right. Anyway, Michael's high school career does end with a little bit of heartache, but he's still a star and he's bound for the university of North Carolina. It's interesting to see these little parallels between great athletes. This passage about Michael's start at UNC is amazing to me because it's exactly what legendary runner Steve Prefontaine did when he showed up at the University of Oregon. Here's what Michael did. I saw it then, Worthy said, that was one of his teammates, the star of UNC before Jordan showed up, James Worthy. Um, I saw it then. He had raw talent. And that was all he was. He came in very confident and seeking out the best and trying to target who he's going to dismantle. The freshman began telling his new teammates he was going to dunk on them. That irritated Worthy the most, it seemed. Others mostly laughed off his talk, but the behavior triggered a concern among the team's veteran players. And he goes on. So according to Worthy, he is seeking out the best players and trying to target and dismantle them. So in practice, what that meant was challenging them to games of one on one at practice. And at first, Michael didn't win every time, but as time wore on, of course, he began to dominate. And that's just like Steve Prefontaine, Pre, who showed up at Oregon and immediately started challenging everyone to races. So there is something to this, this competitiveness, this desire to compete and show that you're better. Once again, he's of course very intense. He's also extremely coachable.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/michael-jordan", "title": "Michael Jordan", "chunk_index": 11, "publication_date": "2024-07-28", "total_chunks_in_doc": 34}}

Once again , he ' s of course very intense . He ' s also extremely coachable . Michael Jordan: He's got this thirst to learn still. His coach Dean Smith said, I had never seen a player listen so closely to what the coaches said and then go and do it. Michael shows himself to be exceptional in the practices leading up to the season. And so he's put into the starting lineup from the start, which was quite rare at the time. You know, most of the time it was kind of like a replay of high school. Right. Um, except there's no JV team in colleges, but you know, freshmen generally would not start, didn't have the chance to start. Um, so it's kind of a big statement that Michael Jordan is put in the starting lineup of one of the best college programs in the nation. Even so. James Worthy was the star of the show, and Jordan was a role player. A very good role player, he averaged 13. 5 points per game, 53 percent shooting, you know, not a star. Coach Dean Smith, that was his coach at UNC, he was big on playing within the system, okay, playing within the offense. And that is mostly what Michael did. But as the season goes on, his role grows, especially in the playoffs, the NCAA tournament. UNC makes it all the way to the championship game. And as they're going through the tournament, Jordan is playing more and more. And he's standing out more and more. They play Georgetown in the final. And it's a very close game. Coach Dean Smith calls a timeout before the final possession with his team down one, and according to him, according to Dean Smith, he makes the decision that Jordan, Michael Jordan should be the one to take the final shot. Okay. The idea being Georgetown. The idea being Georgetown was going to have a game plan around stopping their best player, James Worthy, and that would leave Michael Jordan relatively open. So UNC passes the ball in, and they pass it around for a bit, and then they reverse it to Michael Jordan, who without hesitation, rises up, and with 14 seconds left on the shot, rises up, and with 14 seconds left on the clock, knocks down a jump shot. Okay, the crowd goes berserk. Actually, Georgetown still has a little time to try and score. But they come down, turn the ball over, game over. Everyone celebrates.

Michael Jordan is the hero who has scored the final shot , the game Michael Jordan: winning shot of a national championship. Some people have questioned whether the play really was drawn up for Michael Jordan, and it's true that if you go back and watch it, it doesn't necessarily look like a designed play for him, but either way, whether it was called for Jordan or not, it's a Testament to his nerves, the way he just steps into the shot, no hesitation. Jordan later said that he visualized the shot on the team bus ride to the game. He also said, quote, It was predestined. It was destiny. Ever since I made that shot, everything has just fallen into place for me. I find it very interesting that both he and Napoleon had this firm belief in destiny. That's an interesting concept to me. Obviously, there is something very powerful about believing in your own destiny. So that shot was Michael's arrival on the national stage. And for the rest of his life, he would be a major celebrity. Like from that moment on, he does well for the rest of his career at UNC. Although there were some criticisms of his coach, Dean Smith, that he didn't let Jordan shine enough. You know, as I noted, he was a system coach. He liked his players to stay in that system, to pass the ball around, to only shoot when they had the open shot, not really break down the defense and make one on plays. So Jordan averaged 17 points per game the next season. And there was a joke that people would tell who's the only person who can hold Michael Jordan under 20 points per game. The answer, Dean Smith. All right. In other words, no defender could stop Michael Jordan from getting 20 points a game, but his coaches stopping him from doing it. But Jordan himself never leveled that criticism. He actually loved Dean Smith. They had a very tight relationship and he didn't mind playing in the UNC system, even though it meant scoring, you know, fewer points than he might have otherwise. So he played for two more seasons, his sophomore and junior year. And, um, so he played for two more seasons, his sophomore and junior year.

You can't teach height. Right. And how bad can you be if you're seven feet tall? So, you know, these, these managers, these GMs who are selecting picks, especially at this time, they really liked seven footers.

And of course it ' s never good to pass on Michael Jordan , but this is a Michael Jordan: defensible pick, you know, Hakeem Owajuwon ended up being a multi time all star. He's a hall of famer. He's one of the greatest players in NBA history. He's not Michael Jordan, but most people rate him as somewhere between like the 10th and 20th best player of all time. So like it is a good pick. With the second pick the Portland Trailblazers select Sam Bui and Bui is widely regarded as one of the worst draft picks of all time. The truth is. He wasn't that bad. I mean, actually, if you go look at his highlights, you can see why someone would pick him second overall. He's kind of a crazy athlete and he's got great hands. I mean, huge wingspan, but his problem was he was injury plagued. He broke his leg. He had a bunch of injuries. And so, um, that ruined his career and, you know, he never got to stay on the floor much. And, you know, he's obviously dinged because the Blazers picked him instead of Michael Jordan. So Jordan is selected third by the Chicago Bulls. He's viewed as a flashy and promising young player. But at this point, no one has expectations that he could be anything like the greatest player of all time. The first hint. That he might be something special comes when he leads the USA to a gold medal in the 1984 Olympics before the start of the NBA season, he wasn't necessarily the most highly regarded player coming in, but he really seizes control of the team. But he really seizes control of the team. One of my favorite stories is when they show up for this warmup tournament, the Pan Am games. Uh, they get to their accommodations and, uh, they walk inside this, um, you know, athletes village. And the conditions are just horrible. Uh, they have not been well planned and they are just these empty cement rooms with no furniture. And so you got all these basketball players and they're looking in and they're just staring and no one knows how to react. And Jordan just drops his bag on the floor and says, let's get to work.

So, yeah, um, they play really well. Jordan is the leader of the team, and they win the gold. It's a special moment for Michael. Twelve years earlier, at age nine, Twelve years earlier, at age nine, he had been watching on TV as the United States he had been watching on the TV as the United States had lost to the Russians, the Soviet Union, in the 1972 Summer Olympics. And it was an extremely controversial ending to the game. In fact, , the Americans refused to show up and accept their silver medals. They thought the game was rigged , it was, yeah, it was, it was horrible. Right. And Michael Jordan's just a nine year old watching this and he's so fired up and he goes to the kitchen and tells his mom. Uh, quote, I'm going to be in the Olympics one day and I'm going to make sure we win. Okay. And, uh, you know, she doesn't think much of it at the time, but now it's 1984 and at 21 years of age, Michael Jordan fulfills his promise that he made at nine years old and he wins a gold medal for the USA. That's not the only thing he does. It's a very momentous summer for him before he begins in the NBA. The other big thing that happens at the time is that Nike was about to make one of the best decisions in its history. Uh, their executives had a two point something million dollar budget for pro basketball shoe endorsements. And generally they spread that around a bunch of players, right? And they had this very interesting, uh, promoter named Sonny Vaccaro. Vaccaro, Vaccaro? I think it's Vaccaro, Sonny Vaccaro.

Why would you give him our entire basketball marketing budget? And Sonny Vaccaro says, yeah, it's Vaccaro. Sonny Vaccaro says. Just believe me. Okay. Believe me. And, and Nike ends up trusting Sonny Vaccaro and Michael Jordan did not want to go with Nike at all. He liked Adidas much better. But they offer him this contract 2. 5 million and he goes to Adidas. And he's like, look, you don't even have to beat their offer. Can you just get kind of close to it? And they're like, no, this is crazy. We can not get anywhere close to it. He's like, all right, I guess I'll take the Nike deal. And it ended up being, you know, one of the greatest business deals of all time for both parties. Michael Jordan became a billionaire off of it eventually. And it basically made Nike, . It made them a household name. So. Incredible deal for both parties involved. Sonny Vaccaro, by the way, the next time that he would say, Hey, I found another athlete that I think we should go all in on. It was Kobe Bryant. So like, this is someone who could really evaluate talent., would love to study him someday and learn what his secret was. So, uh, he signs this deal with Nike. He's getting a lot of money from them. Uh, he's a gold medalist. And when he shows up in Chicago, he finds a franchise that is just pitiful. This was a time in the NBA when players were making tons of money, For the first time, , you know, in the fifties and in the sixties. And really in the seventies, they just hadn't been making that much money as professional basketball players. But now, you know, they're millionaires, they're making tons and they just really were not ready to deal with the amount of money that was coming to them. And so lots of NBA players made bad decisions of partying cocaine addiction was especially prevalent. And Chicago was one of the worst teams for this.

Their practice court, like sometimes they would have to wait on high school and even middle school teams to finish before they could practice and no one cared about the bulls. Chicago was a football town. Uh, there, Chicago was a football town. That's all anyone cared about. They were lucky if their arena was half filled. For a game. It was just a bad situation in Chicago. The good news is that the team was so bad and so rudderless. The Michael Jordan has no problem making himself the de facto leader in the locker room. He really does this first in practice. Okay. Before games even start his teammate, uh, said that quote, he came to practice every day, like it was game seven of the NBA finals, he would destroy you in practice. That's what set the tone for our team. And once the regular season starts, Jordan is good right away. You know, he's a rookie, never played before, um, but he acclimatizes to NBA basketball very quickly. He scores 45 points in just his ninth game. And then he starts rattling off 40 point games, 42 against New York, 45 against Atlanta, 45 again against Cleveland. So his intensity had managed to turn around the morale and focus of the team. And they actually sneak into the playoffs with a 38 and 44 record. They're beaten in the first round by the Milwaukee Bucks. So that's Jordan's rookie year. In his second year, Jordan broke his foot and missed a few months of games. He made it back in time for the playoffs where they played the dominant Boston Celtics in the first round. And, um, one of the very famous lines of Jordan's life comes from that series. So in game two of that playoff series, , they had lost game one. . And Michael Jordan determined that he was going to have to do just about everything if they wanted to win against the Celtics. And so he was determined to do just that. And so he comes out gunning in game two and he went off for 63 points and the Celtics try to defend him with everyone. They put, uh, Danny Ainge on him. They put Kevin McHale on him for a while.

And that becomes one of the all time great NBA quotes as God disguised as Michael Jordan. So in his first two years, Michael Jordan had already elevated the Bulls from bottom of the barrel. One of the worst teams in the league. To a fringe playoff team, right? They're just barely making the playoffs. And the next year, the Bulls hire a new head coach named Doug Collins. Okay. So the first year of Doug Collins, Michael Jordan averaged 37 points per game, which is the most points per game ever scored in an 82 game season. And that record still stands by the way. But the bulls were once again, uh, they make the playoffs. They do a little better, but once again, even so they're swept by the Celtics. You know, he's, he's averaging 37 points a game, which is like jaw dropping. It's amazing. But his ball dominance became somewhat controversial. And after one game, as Michael Jordan walked off the floor, one of the assistant coaches barked at him, Hey, Michael, there's no I in team. And Jordan shoots right back. Yeah, but there isn't win. Becomes controversial, but as you can see, Michael Jordan does not really have a mind towards slowing his scoring pace at all. The next year, Michael Jordan wins MVP, and the Bulls win 50 games for the first time in franchise history. And they made it past the first round for the first time, beating the Cavaliers. And this time, in the second round, they face not the Celtics, but the Pistons. The Pistons were very physical. Their nickname was the Bad Boys. Okay. You hear people talking about the bad boys, Pistons, and they would knock you down, throw elbows. They're kind of dirty, especially Bill Lampier is one of their forwards. They just beat you by beating you up. Right. Very physical, like physically punishing to play the South. It was like physically punishing to play the Pistons. They were also great. They're great teams. They won two championships, one in 89 and 90, I think. And the Pistons would beat the Bulls in the playoffs", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/michael-jordan", "title": "Michael Jordan", "chunk_index": 19, "publication_date": "2024-07-28", "total_chunks_in_doc": 34}}

And the Pistons would beat the Bulls in the playoffs Michael Jordan: for three consecutive years. Okay, so this is who they have to try and get through, and year after year they're failing. Uh, one of the things the Pistons use is something they call the Jordan Rules, which were a specific set of rules for guarding Michael Jordan to make sure he couldn't do too much damage against them in the playoffs. And so they would double team him, force him to the middle of the floor, where there was help defense, try to deny him the ball as much as possible, all sorts of stuff. And it really worked. The Bulls just couldn't deal with the Pistons. It's this great rivalry. The teams genuinely do not like each other. Like hated each other, but they all, the cheap, the teams do not like each other, like genuinely hated each other, but they also brought out the best in each other. There were these amazing games between the two teams, the Pistons, uh, main star, uh, Joe Dumars, actually, anyway, one of their main stars described it this way, quote, those games were intense, emotional. It could be the middle of January, but it was always like the playoffs, incredible intensity. Everybody was emotional in those games. Nobody wanted to lose. And we would sit there with tears in our eyes when we didn't win. I'm fortunate and blessed that I played in that kind of atmosphere. So they keep making it further and further in the playoffs, but they keep facing the Pistons every time these three years. So, um, and I should mention actually, that is during this era that you have one of Michael Jordan's most iconic moments is now simply known as the shot. It was a last minute shot against the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Bulls were down one with three seconds remaining and the Bulls were down one with three seconds remaining. So the Bulls call a timeout and Doug Collins, the coach actually draws up a play for someone else. Uh, cause he's figuring, well, they're going to double team Michael. So someone else should get the shot. Michael smacks the clipboard and he yells, just give me the effing ball. So that is the play call. Just give Michael the effing ball. And, uh, so they're inbounding it. They do double team, Michael. And so he breaks out from this double team, gets the ball, breaks out his double team, gets the ball.

And so he breaks out from this double team , gets the ball , breaks out his double team , gets the ball . He Michael Jordan: takes two dribbles to the top of the key where he pulls up for a shot and he jumps and for a moment, his defender, Craig Elo catches up and has his hand right on the ball, but Jordan just hangs in the air while Elo drifts past him. And he double clutches and shoots the ball. And it goes in and game is over bulls win. And Michael Jordan is there in the middle of the court, just pumping his arm wildly in the air. While ELO like dramatically throws his arms up and collapses on the sideline, like in total despair. It's honestly like, if you have never seen. Just go to YouTube right now and search Michael Jordan, the shot and watch this. It's like a Renaissance painting. Like the reactions are so amazing. It's so poetic. It's almost unbelievable that it actually happened. Anyway, I didn't want to skip over that. So regardless, I mean, that is one of the all time great Michael Jordan moments. They win that series, but then they play the Pistons the next round and they lose. In that series that they lose to the Pistons, you can see how Jordan pushed people. So, um, it's a, it's actually a seven game series. Okay. It goes to game seven. It's best of seven. The Bulls have won three, the Pistons have won three. It's going to game seven. And, um, two of their best players, uh, were injured. So Paxson, he's a good shooter and he had a sprained ankle. And then Scotty Pippen, who you might've heard of, had some really bad migraines. He'd get migraines sometimes. And so before game seven. He has these horrible migraines, right? And it's looking like he's not gonna be able to play through him. And so, uh, this is what happened according to the team trainer, Mark Fail. He said, he actually came to me before the game and said he couldn't see. I said, can you play? He started to tell me no. And Michael jumped in and said, hell yes, he can play. Start him, let him play blind. Okay. So, uh, that was how badly Michael Jordan wanted to win and how badly he was willing to push other people. He's like, I don't care if Scottie Pippen is blind, he's playing", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/michael-jordan", "title": "Michael Jordan", "chunk_index": 21, "publication_date": "2024-07-28", "total_chunks_in_doc": 34}}

He ' s like , I don ' t care if Scottie Pippen is blind , he ' s playing Michael Jordan: tonight. Okay. He pushed people, he gave everything and he expected everyone else to give everything as well when they were playing. Okay. So obviously Pippen does play. But regardless, they lost game seven and they lose to the Pistons again. However, a few things turned around for them the next season. First of all, they had a new head coach in 1989 named Phil Jackson. Phil is a character. He's like a Zen cowboy. Okay. So on the one hand, he grows up in a very rural area in the U. S. It grows up in Montana and North Dakota. Like really, it doesn't get more rural than that. And so he has this hardworking cowboy background, but he was also big into the counterculture movement. He had done LSD in the sixties. He was big into meditation and native American rituals and yoga. He would burn sage in the locker room to ward off bad spirits. Okay. He's like this very interesting guy. And he was a very keen student of psychology and human nature. He was very hands off for the most part, but he knew just when to push someone's buttons, to push them to a higher level of performance. So the Vols really improve under, um, so the Vols really improve under Phil Jackson. And a big part of that is him getting Jordan to realize that for the good of the team, he needs to share the ball more. In fact, one of the strategies of the Pistons had been, let's let Michael Jordan shoot as much as he wants through the first three quarters. And then in the fourth quarter, we double team him. And so the other Bulls players have basically not shot the ball through the first three quarters. So they're cold, they're out of rhythm, and they're not ready to knock down open shots. So when they start double teaming Michael Jordan in the fourth quarter, you know, he's throwing it to these open guys and they're bricking all their shots. So Michael Jordan's kind of selfishness with the ball had gotten so bad that other people were using it as a part of their strategy. So in Jackson's first year, there is quite a bit of improvement though. They were still knocked out of the playoffs by the Pistons, but the Bulls are even better in Phil Jackson's second year with the team. Part of that was due to the improvement. Of Scotty Pippen, who we just", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/michael-jordan", "title": "Michael Jordan", "chunk_index": 22, "publication_date": "2024-07-28", "total_chunks_in_doc": 34}}

Part of that was due to the improvement . Of Scotty Pippen , who we just Michael Jordan: mentioned, uh, he became an all star that year. So he had been improving, but that was the year he really arrived as an elite player in the NBA. One thing that Phil Jackson figured out was he could turn Pippen and Jordan on each other in practice. He would organize games with Jordan on one side and Pippen on the other. And the competition was absolutely fierce. Jordan had always brought a high level of intensity to practices. But this was the first time, at the NBA level at least, that he had a teammate who could actually push him to another level. You know, before on these horrible Bulls teams, like, Michael Jordan was one of the only things they had going for him. Whoever's team Michael Jordan was on was going to win no problem. But now with another all star, you know, Scotty Pippen on the other side, like it's intense. These, these games are good and they're just, I mean, we'll hear more stories about it later that they're extremely intense practices and that gets the Bulls, you know, and that gets the Bulls playing at a very, very high level.

So they play them in the conference finals in the Eastern conference. Finals, um, but they beat them and they make it to the NBA finals. And in that series, they were playing the Los Angeles Lakers. The Bulls went up 3 1 and in the fifth game of the series, you can really see the influence of Jackson's leadership. The Bulls went up 3 1 and in the fifth game of the series, again, it's best of seven, so if they win four games, they win. So game five, the bulls have a chance to close it out. And it's in that game that you can really see Phil Jackson's leadership. He was very tight. And as the game went deeper into the second half, Michael Jordan was trying to do everything himself and struggling in the process, right? Obviously the Lakers can then just key in their defense on Michael Jordan. And so during a timeout late in the fourth quarter, Phil Jackson turns to Michael and says, Michael. Michael Jordan is like kind of stunned, doesn't know if he actually wants an answer. And so he doesn't say anything. And he says again to him, Michael, who's open. And finally, Michael looks up and says, Pax. And Jackson says, we'll throw him the effing ball. And so, uh, Jordan's like, okay, I guess we'll see. So he goes in, he drives, kicks it out to Paxson who knocks down a three immediately, and he does that a few more times. Uh, john Paxson had a huge game, knocked down some clutch threes and they win. They win the championship. It's a huge celebration in Chicago, you know, as I said, Chicago was not a basketball town. No one cared about the bulls when Michael Jordan came to Chicago. But over these, what was it, six, seven years before they won the championship, you know, Michael Jordan was such an outstanding athlete. He's such an exciting player that he was a global phenomenon. People came to see him wherever he played. But, you know, the bulls had become huge in Chicago.

And shortly before that third championship, Michael's father, James Jordan had been killed in a robbery gone wrong. He had been driving somewhere and had pulled off the side of the road and, uh, and gone to sleep in his car. And someone had come to rob him and, uh, and killed him. had a huge psychological effect on Michael Jordan, who had this very complicated relationship with his father, but he loved him very, very much and always was really trying to please him still in his life. And so he's got this major stress in his life. , it's causing depression, frankly, from the death of his father. And at the same time, stress had been building on the bulls for multiple directions for years now. There were conflicts between management and the players, conflicts between players, especially when a book was published called The Jordan Rules. And it was a tell all that exposed what the team was like on the inside. And it showed Michael Jordan in a very unflattering light. It talked about these intense practices, and how he would yell and scream at players, and push them, and, and, you know. He came across as like a tyrant, very abusive. And it became clear from reading this book, that some players had spoken to the press about this. And so, uh, You know, Jordan is like, okay, well, we got some traders here on the team. So, you know, he's got the stress from all this pressure plus the death of his father. And so Michael Jordan, after three straight championships, he feels like he has nothing left to prove and he decides to retire and he decides in his retirement. And he decides when he retires, you know, he's only 30 years old. He's extremely young still. Uh, so everyone's saying, what are you going to do? And the thing he decides to do Is play baseball instead. And I think there was some deep seated psychological issues with his father at play. Some somewhat how I think there was some deep seated psychological issues in his decision to play baseball. Um, his father had loved baseball. That was his favorite sport.

And he Michael Jordan: was the member of the family who was most reluctant to see Michael give up on baseball to play basketball. Although he obviously did come around eventually. So anyway, uh, for whatever reason, Michael says, I've proven everything I need to prove at basketball. , I'm sick of this. I'm sick of the stress and the pressure. I want to go play baseball. So he signs with the White Sox, which is a team in Chicago. He plays for their program. He never makes it to the big leagues. He never plays actually for the white Sox, but he plays for their affiliate programs, it's called the minor leagues. Okay. So like, uh, not the top league, um, but he plays professional baseball. He's actually not terrible, he's actually not terrible. He's not good, but he's not terrible, which is pretty remarkable actually. Cause as gifted as an athlete, you know, Michael Jordan was, you can't just take 15 years off of a sport and then expect to be able to compete at a professional level. Like that is pretty insane. The fact that he could complete. The fact that he could compete and do okay in the minor leagues is pretty remarkable in and of itself. Um, but he is actually, he's pretty bad at the start, but over the course of just a year, he makes a lot of progress and he's hitting like around 300, which is like a pretty good batting percentage by the time he stops playing baseball. But eventually there's a, a lockout in baseball. They can't make an agreement between the players association and the owners of the teams. And so he's like, Oh, great. I left basketball to play baseball. Now I can't play baseball. There's no professional baseball happening. So he's like, Oh, what will I do? I was like, Oh, I wonder what's happening at the, uh, at the bulls facility. And so he just starts showing up at practices. And he's shooting around a little bit and, you know, doing some drills with some guys playing. And, um, he's like, huh, I really miss this.

It's two words long. It just says, I'm back. That's it. It is literally a press release that just says, you know, from Michael Jordan's agent, dah, dah, dah. I'm back. I would love to know who on his team was behind that move because, uh, I haven't found that information anywhere, but it's brilliant. You know, the greatest slogans and statements are always just a few words. You know, I'm back. Just do it. Think different. Um, veni, vidi, vici. Right. Just a few words. If you can capture something, you In just a few words that sticks in people's brains. Well, Jordan's first year back, uh, he joins late in the season. He's still playing himself into shape and they actually do make the playoffs and they make a run, but they're not able to get it done. They don't make it to the finals. However, that summer they get a full summer of training camp. According to everyone who's there, it is like an insane level of practice and intensity. You know, Jordan's practice. I've said it a bunch of times now. They're always insanely intense, right? But he's just ratcheting it up year by year. It's getting more and more intense, And you get some crazy stories from this training camp, uh, by now there were new teammates who had not experienced Jordan's practices. One of those was a player named Steve Kerr, and he described the experience this way we had no idea. He was so intense and condescending in many ways. None of us felt comfortable. On a daily basis, he would just dominate practice. Not physically, but emotionally. And in an intimidating fashion. He was going to make us compete. Whether we wanted to or not, There's certain days where it's like, you're an NBA player and you're exhausted. Every team goes through this. There's just days that you're not There's just days and you're going to go and get your shots up, but you just need your rest. And Michael doesn't need rest.

And so on those days when people were tired, he would ridicule us and cajole us and, you know, just yell at us. It was tough. It was hard to deal with. Okay. So like, it sounds like borderline abusive, right? And then one day it actually boils over in practice. And, uh, well, here's what happens according to Steve Kerr. And, uh, well, actually here's what happens according to Steve Kerr. This is what I remember. We had a scrimmage and the starters were beating up on us. We were the red team and they were getting away with fouling. Michael was just being incredibly physical. And Phil had left to go up to his office. He had to go tend to a phone call or something. And so Phil's absence definitely led to a situation where it was a little out of control. Michael was talking all kinds of crap. It really is a kind of blur as to what he was saying. But I got really fed up, you know. Because I felt like they were fouling every time. And Michael was fouling. The assistant coaches are reffing and they don't want to call a foul on Michael. He's talking and I start talking back. I'm not sure anyone had done that before. He was guarding me, and I think I used my off arm and threw an elbow or something to get him off me, and he kept talking. Then I'm yapping, and the next play, I'm running through the lane, and he gives me a forearm shiver in the middle of the lane, and I give him one back. And he basically came after me. I was like the kid in Jurassic Park who got attacked by the Velociraptor. I had no chance. It was just mayhem. We were screaming at each other, and our teammates, thank God, they all ran in and pulled us apart. But I ended up with a black eye. Apparently I got punched. I don't even remember getting hit. Michael stormed out of practice, and Phil came down and came over to talk to me. He said, you and Michael have to patch things up. You gotta talk to him, and you gotta patch it up. I got home, and there was a message on my phone on my answering machine from Michael, and he apologized.

It was like from that day forward, our relationship was great. Like, you know, a few days after that, where it was a little weird, just because of what had happened. But clearly, he accepted me from that point on. Okay, so it takes a fist fight for Michael Jordan to fully accept Steve Kerr. As a teammate, and that was classic Michael Jordan, not necessarily the fist fight. I mean, that's the only time I heard about that, but he liked to test people to push them. And if you folded and gave into him, that was the worst thing you could do. And you know, a lot of people made that mistake, but if you stood up to him, then he would respect you. It's very Steve jobs ask, right? He did that exact same thing. You know, he would needle and push and push his employees. To see if they really believed in what they were saying, and if they stood up for themselves, then he respected that. And if they folded, oh, then he was just going to walk all over them. And look, that approach, it's not for everyone, but I mean, jeez, I mean, it seems to work in terms of getting high level of performance out of your team, whether in sports or in business. You know, the other thing I'll say about it briefly, Is Bill Gates joke that any biography about Steve jobs should be called. Don't try this at home. And I do think that, um, if that's in you, if you have that dog, like Michael Jordan or Steve jobs, then accept it and don't be afraid to test people and push them. Uh, apparently it works in certain contexts and that's great. But if you don't, there's nothing worse than someone unnecessarily being a jerk. Because they're pulling an Elizabeth Holmes and they're, you know, consciously trying to do a Steve Jobs impression. So I wouldn't necessarily try to emulate Michael Jordan, Steve Jobs in that regard. If that's who you are, then don't be ashamed of it. It's a great approach for those for whom it works.

And in game six, the Bulls were up three, two in a best of seven series. So if they win this game, they win the championship. And it came right down to the wire. The Jazz actually had the ball. They had possession of the ball and they were up one point with only 20 seconds left. And Carl Malone was probably their best player. And he's holding the ball. And Michael Jordan comes up behind him and strips the ball from him. He dribbles up the court. And waited out the clock on the left side of the court. He dribbled up the court and waited out the clock on the left side of the court, a little bit above the three point line. And then with about nine seconds left, he started his move toward the center of the court. He takes a couple dribbles and then crossed the ball from his right hand to his left as his defender went skidding by. He pulled up for a perfect 18 footer, which he sank. He held his high. He held his hand high in the air. It was a perfect follow through to a perfect shot. That capped a perfect career. The bulls actually might've had another championship run in them. Um, Michael Jordan actually wanted to try and run it back, but the team was broken up by mismanagement. Uh, the time was coming to renegotiate Phil Jackson's contract and the bulls didn't want to pay him the going salary for top coach in the league. They thought it was too much. And their general manager, Jerry Krause kind of wanted to prove that he could win a championship without Phil Jackson. And so they said they weren't going to bring back Phil Jackson. And Jordan said, well, I'm not going to play for anyone else other than Phil Jackson. So pay him, bring him back or I'm gone. And, uh, they didn't pay him. They let Phil Jackson go and true to his word, when the Bulls let go of Phil, Michael Jordan retired. And so that, that final shot did mark the end of his career.

He was a pretty terrible owner, to be honest, the team did really poorly under his management. And he recently sold them in other ventures. He has done better. His deal with Nike is the most lucrative deal of its kind ever from both sides. And it has made Michael Jordan a billionaire. Um, Jordan brand is a separate brand within the Nike company and Jordan shoes. There's like a whole culture. Of Jordan shoes. They sell for hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars. And, uh, it's a very successful brand and it has made Michael Jordan. Um, I mean, there were years in which he made hundreds of millions of dollars in a single year. I mean, there were years when he made hundreds of millions of dollars in a single year, just from his Nike contract, like not from playing basketball. And, you know, I could go more into the business side of things, but the truth of the matter is, Michael Jordan is not a great businessman. He's fine. Um, he's done some things well with Jordan brand. He's done other things, you know, not so well. Uh, I know some people who've worked in Nike and most of them did not consider Jordan brand a, uh, a paragon of effective management. Um, so yeah, I mean, that's fine. You know, so yeah, and that's fine. Michael Jordan was a great athlete, a great competitor. And my attitude is who cares what else he may or may not have been good at. So, uh, I'll close with one of my favorite Michael Jordan quotes. And here's what he said. I can accept failure. Everyone fails at something, but I can't accept not trying. I can't accept it. But Michael Jordan was a great athlete, a great competitor, and who cares what else he may or may not have been good at. You know, as an athlete, as a competitor, he is eternal.

One of the things that Phil Jackson would do to motivate his players is hand out books. And not like the same book to the whole team. He would give personal books as gifts to his players. Um, and they were often like kind of weird esoteric stuff. So song of Solomon, he gave out Shantaram, like very 60s, 70s, hippie stuff that he'd grown up with that had motivated him. Right.

{"text": "Steve Prefontaine: Hello, and welcome to How to Take Over the World. This is Ben Wilson. Today, we are talking about Steve Prefontaine, one of the all time great middle distance runners. If you haven't heard of Steve, he's famous for a few things. He was a great runner, held a number of American records, but he never actually won a gold medal at the Olympics. So why study a runner who never ever won the gold? So why study a runner Well, one thing is the way he was able to use his abilities as a runner to build his celebrity and become famous. Despite, you know, maybe not being the best in the world, but the biggest reason I wanted to do this episode is his mindset. This is someone who, who was not the most naturally gifted runner in the world, but achieved truly great things, regardless, through his mindset, his work ethic, his grit. And that is worth studying. I mean, if I were to study a runner and the takeaways were, you know, be born with elite lung capacity, leg strength, and cardiovascular efficiency, then there wouldn't be a lot to learn from the episode. I actually first got interested in Pre from a quote that I read. I tried to find the providence of this quote, and I have to conclude that it's probably fake. So keep that in mind. This is not a real quote, but, uh, it's a good encapsulation of the attitude of Steve Brifontaine. . And here it is. Here's what the quote says. It says, no matter how hard you train, somebody will train harder. No matter how hard you run, somebody will run harder. No matter how bad you want it, somebody will want it more. I am that somebody. It's a great quote, right? I wish it was real. But regardless, it does kind of capture who he was. He's one of the most determined people I have ever read about. Everything about him was enthusiasm, passion, obsession. He also happens to have been the first great Nike athlete. I think he was actually the first Nike sponsored athlete and had a big part in the success of Nike. Of that now great company. It's a very inspiring story and I hope it inspires you as much as it inspired me. My source for this episode is pre the story of America's greatest running legend, Steve Brifontaine. By Tom Jordan.

My source for this episode is pre the story of America ' s greatest running legend , Steve Brifontaine . By Tom Jordan . So Steve Prefontaine: let's get into it. This is Steve Prefontaine before we get into it. I want to quickly shout out the first ever, how to take over the world event on August 22nd through the 25th. Every great achiever has an elite group around them. And that is what I'm trying to cultivate here. A group of people who are trying to take over the world, who you can take inspiration from bounce ideas off of collaborate with and form friendships with it's going to be awesome. We're going to be at Hacienda Zuleta, a very cool venue just outside of Quito, Ecuador. We're going to be having a good time. Donkey rides, hot air balloons, all that. So we would love to have you go learn more and apply at nowheresummit. com. Steve Roland Prefontaine was born on January 25th, 1951, in Coos Bay, Oregon, a small town on the cold Oregon coast. Coos Bay was a sleepy little town, and there were not a lot of ways to get ahead. As Prefontaine would later say, quote, You don't have many ways to jump in Coos Bay. You can be an athlete. Athletes are very, very big in Coos Bay. You can study, try to be an intellectual, but there aren't very many of those. Or you can go drag the gut in your lowered Chevy with a switchblade in your pocket. I had to go look up dragging the gut, and that means that's going cruising down the main drag, going by showing off your car. So from a young age, Steve had this motivation to distinguish himself, to make it big. Quote, what I want is to be number one, is how Steve put it. So as he said, athletics was one way to make it. He was naturally a pretty gifted athlete, but he was only 5'9 so he was too short to be a great basketball or football player, um, though he tried both as a boy. So one day in middle school, he's in P. E. class, and they have a distance running unit. And in only a few weeks, he becomes one of the best distance runners in his grade. And so he thinks, okay, I found something here that I'm naturally good at, where I can excel. So he goes out for the track and field and cross country teams in high school. His freshman and sophomore years, so that's ninth and tenth grade for you non", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/steve-prefontaine", "title": "Steve Prefontaine", "chunk_index": 1, "publication_date": "2024-07-18", "total_chunks_in_doc": 18}}
{"text": "found something here that I ' m naturally good at , where I can excel . So he goes out for the track and field and cross country teams in high school . His freshman and sophomore years , so that ' s ninth and tenth grade for you non Steve Prefontaine: Americans, he is good, but he's not a great runner quite yet. One of the things that actually holds him back initially is he is too intense and excitable. So there, so there's a great quote from the book about this. So there's a great quote in the book about this. It says,. His goals were high for the outdoor track season, but months of frustration ended in his failure to make the state meet, caused in part perhaps by his strong interest in the performance of other members of the team. He was always running up and down shouting encouragement and advice, His coach McClure recalls, we finally had to tell him, look, we'll do the coaching. You do the running. Okay. So he's so excitable that sometimes he'll be in the lead and he'll run back to other runners on his team and, and try and motivate them. The other way, this excitability and enthusiasm manifests itself is He is conflict. So during one race quote, when in a physical cross country race against Sheldon high school, the tough kid from Coos Bay indelicately took a swing at rival, John Anderson, the future winner of the 1973 Boston marathon. All right. So this is someone who is so intense that sometimes he's literally throwing punches at his competitors. So once his coaches get him to stop running back and forth and trying to hype up his teammates and getting into fist fights with his competitors during competition, that's His performance improved significantly, and by his junior year, he is an extremely elite middle distance runner. By the way, by middle distance, the shortest distance he would do was the mile. He was also very good at the two mile. His best event was the three mile, and he sometimes competed in the 10, 000 meter event, which is equivalent to about six miles. So, as I said, he's naturally pretty gifted. Maybe not the most gifted, and certainly not the most technically gifted. Um, proficient runner, uh, the thing that really sets him apart is as the book puts it quote, his ability to accept mentally and physically the punishment of training. Okay. It goes on pre was the hardest worker in running that I ever had by far. McClure remembers. This is the whole thing, his intensity on his morning runs. I didn't check on him.

{"text": "ever had by far . McClure remembers . This is the whole thing , his intensity on his morning runs . I didn ' t check on him . I just said , if you want to be a good runner , you got to go out there in the Steve Prefontaine: mornings. He worked awful hard. Okay. So I really liked that he worked awful hard and he had an amazing ability to accept mental and physical punishment. Again, from a technique standpoint, uh, he's anything but elite. Here's what his coach said. His talent was not that he had great style. He didn't. It got better. I think we worked probably harder on that than we did on anything. He'd like to slump over and we'd keep hollering. He'd like to slump over and we'd keep hollering at him. No, he'd like to slump over and we'd keep hollering at him. No, his talent was his control of his fatigue and his pain. His threshold was different than most of us, whether it was inborn or he developed it himself. Okay, so I think this is an amazing takeaway. I think optimization is overrated. Figure out the technique later. My friend Sean Puri has a great line. He says, intensity is the strategy. Technique and strategy matter. Yes, especially in the long run, but that can come later. You know, as McClure said, it got better, I think. And that can always improve, but intensity is absolutely necessary. And that ability to accept and overcome pain is absolutely necessary. My friend, David Cenner of the founders podcast likes to share this quote that I love from Issy Sharpe, the founder of the four seasons, who says excellence is often just the capacity for taking pain, the ability to experience it, go through it and keep going. You know, I mentioned that quote from David Senra. This podcast is sponsored by founders podcast. If you love how to take over the world, if you love learning lessons from some of the greatest achievers in history, you'll love founders. It's like how to take over the world but specifically about the stories of great founders in history, and it's for founders and what, you know, you as a founder can learn from them. So it's an incredible podcast. If you love how to take over the world, you will love founders. Go give it a listen, wherever you get your podcasts. Okay. And even though that quote is from an entrepreneur, obviously, I think you see some real nice alignment there between what it takes to be a great entrepreneur and what it takes to be a great runner. That was what made Steve Prefontaine excellent. The ability to take pain", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/steve-prefontaine", "title": "Steve Prefontaine", "chunk_index": 3, "publication_date": "2024-07-18", "total_chunks_in_doc": 18}}

That was what made Steve Prefontaine excellent . The ability to take pain Steve Prefontaine: and keep going. I think one thing that helps in this domain is to rewire your brain to see barriers as filters. So whether you're a runner or an entrepreneur or anything else, when you encounter something that deals out pain, You know, a hurdle, a roadblock, something difficult. You should rewire your inner monologue to say, good, you know, great. I found the filter. This is the thing that weeds out the week. This is where I win because the easy stuff is the stuff that everyone is doing. You should get excited when you encounter pain, because it means you are on the cusp of breaking away from the pack because most people don't want to take that pain. and so I think those are two of the big secrets behind Steve Brifontaine. First, his emotion, his excitability, his enthusiasm and passion. The second was his ability to take pain, which we just discussed. And then the third secret to his success is consistency. One of the things that people talk about is his habit of running at six in the morning. And he did it every single day. Steve was an extrovert. . He was outgoing and he liked to party, but even on nights where he was out past midnight drinking beer. He would be up the next morning at 6 a. m. sharp running and going through his workout. And then he would work out later too with the team. Uh, he sometimes would work out at night. He was such a hard worker. But no matter how much work he had done the day before, The 6 a. m. run was unmissable. So here's what the book had to say about his consistency. And unlike those who could manage several such workouts and then break down with illness or injury, Pre had the physique and temperament to come back for more. I guess the thing that stands out, says Oregon coach Bill Dellinger quietly when asked of Pre's greatest talent, is that he went through four years of college without ever missing a workout because of a cold or illness. Four years of never missing any meets. . I really do think that's a strategy for succeeding at basically anything. If you can have intensity and passion, if you can have the ability to take pain and keep going, and then just unbelievable consistency, then you will succeed at almost anything. I really do think it's that simple. So Steve is training all the time in high school. In fact, for the people of Coos", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/steve-prefontaine", "title": "Steve Prefontaine", "chunk_index": 4, "publication_date": "2024-07-18", "total_chunks_in_doc": 18}}

So Steve is training all the time in high school . In fact , for the people of Coos Steve Prefontaine: Bay, it becomes something of a joke to say, there goes pre. Okay. Cause everyone saw him running around town all the time. He was always running. So they would see him go by, turn to each other, shake their head to say, there goes pre. So his junior year, that is 11th grade is when things really come together for him as a runner for the first time. He goes undefeated in cross country and wins the state title. Everyone wants to recruit him to run at their college. But he didn't have to look far because the nation's greatest track and field program had just been built up by the legendary coach Bill Bowerman just down the road at the University of Oregon, which is in Eugene, Oregon. It's only about two hours drive from Coos Bay. Uh, his assistant coach, Bill Dellinger was also very involved with Pre and here's what Bill Dellinger had to say about the first time that he went to go watch him run., He said, I was standing on a hill, I had my binoculars and I was probably a good half mile or 700 yards away from the start. And I saw this guy that had the start position, but it was the look in his eyes from a half mile distance, the intensity in his face as the gun went off. I thought, that's got to be Pree. And by the way, that look in his eyes, that is something we talked about last episode on the Picasso episode. Everyone talked about Picasso's gaze. The way he looked at you, straight in the eyes, he held eye contact, and I compared that to Alexander Hamilton and Steve Jobs and all these incredibly charismatic people. They have this way of drawing you in by looking you in the eyes, maintaining eye contact, and focusing on you with this gaze while they're in conversation with you. Um, well, listen to this quote from the book about Pree. Pree would fix you with a steady gaze and give the impression that you were the most important person in his life at that instant, and that the things he was telling you were known by few others. He was an enormously flattering and appealing trait and contributed greatly to what came to be called his charisma. Just crazy. As I've said, I don't really traffic in hacks or shortcuts, but this is the closest thing I have ever found, to a foolproof hack, maintain eye contact and stare a person in the eyes.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/steve-prefontaine", "title": "Steve Prefontaine", "chunk_index": 5, "publication_date": "2024-07-18", "total_chunks_in_doc": 18}}

These very charismatic people do this one thing and it really draws people in. Everyone notes it, so it's something I've been trying and I recommend you try it as well. Okay. So he's recruited to Oregon. Bill Bowerman writes to pre's mom saying quote, I have every confidence that if he keeps his eye on the target and his dedication with his background and with the future, he will become the greatest runner in the world. Steve later said that was all I needed to hear. Okay. So he's, you know, I've got one of the greatest coaches in the world, Bill Bowerman telling me that I could be the greatest runner. That's what I want. Oregon's the place for me. Speaking of his letter writing. So you just heard Bill Bowerman wrote a letter to his family. Pre was a big letter writer. He loved to send postcards whenever he went to track meets. But his handwriting was terrible. And why was it so bad? Here's what a friend said, quote, Steve spoke better than he wrote, because he was always in too much of a hurry to punctuate his sentences or read over for errors. In fact, I'm surprised he had the patience to write at all. And that was something, that impatience, that kind of applied to everything. Here's another quote, pre was not easygoing in any way says teammate Paul Geiss Everything had to be competitive or fast You could come in from a workout and have gotten out of your clothes and be already walking to the shower when pre came in And yet, by the time you came out of the shower, he would have gotten undressed, have already showered, dressed, and be shaking the water from his hair, anxious to get on the road. He was just always in a rush. It was a phenomenon. Okay, that trait of impatience is something I've called out before. Actually, it's, it's something that I really took from my first episode studying Napoleon. Great achievers have this monstrous impatience. They want to move faster and accomplish things faster.

Okay, so as a senior, He sets the U S high school record for the three mile, and then he wins the state championship in the mile and the two mile on the way to helping his team win the overall state championship. And that was a very difficult feat. Very rare for a state championship. Most people would be focused on just one event because the meat happens on one day. So if you're going. all out running one mile, then it's gonna be really hard to have the lungs and, uh, the recovery and be ready to run the two mile in an elite fashion. Uh, but he wants to prove just how good he is. And so, um, he wins both in the same day and more than that. You know, more than just winning and being a great runner, he becomes something of a phenomenon in Coos Bay. People there, as I mentioned, loved basketball and football, but now they start showing up in numbers to watch Steve Prefontaine run, which is unheard of. In high school, I played basketball and did track and our basketball games usually had a lot of fans. People would show up and watch, but my track meets, the only people in the stands were parents. Even at regional championships and things like that.

Even at regional championships and things like that . Uh , I remember going to the NorCal finals for Steve Prefontaine: track. And that had about as many fans as a normal, regular season basketball game. Like just, track is, is not a sport that people show up for in the US. So the fact that crowds are filling up the bleachers at Pre's track meets is a testament to his charisma and to the cult following that he was building. So he graduates high school and when he shows up at Oregon, They have this legendary track program, as I mentioned, built by Bill Bowerman. But even with all these great athletes that they already have, Pre has a reputation coming in. He also has a lot of self confidence, and that comes out sometimes as naivete. So here's how Bill Dellinger puts it. He says, He was just pretty naive as a freshman. He was someone who didn't know any better, and went out and did whatever he said he was going to do. We nicknamed him the Rube. Okay. I love that. I think it's a great mindset. I think naivete is great, especially when it comes to achieving your goals. Okay. I love this idea that Steve is going and doing stuff that should be impossible because he just doesn't know any better. He doesn't know it's impossible. So he tries it and he achieves it. One thing about all these great achievers is they have tremendous self confidence and the question is, of course, does that confidence precede accomplishment? Or is it a consequence of it? Are these people successful because they are self confident or are they self confident because they are successful? And I think there's a little bit of both. Uh, there's a positive reinforcement loop success begets confidence, which begets more success. So when people ask me whether they should be confident at the start, I think it comes back to the idea of. Of being naive, or in other words, don't let others or your own beliefs dictate what you cannot do. Let reality and the laws of physics dictate your limits. And they will of course, eventually, but if you listen to other people and what they say you can't do, or you listen to your own own fears, then you're never going to push yourself enough to find those limits. So I like to say. That attribute, Bill Dellinger told us, he was naive, he was a rube. Be naive when it comes to your own limitations. Nothing is impossible until you have hard evidence to the contrary.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/steve-prefontaine", "title": "Steve Prefontaine", "chunk_index": 8, "publication_date": "2024-07-18", "total_chunks_in_doc": 18}}

Nothing is impossible until you have hard evidence to the contrary . Steve Prefontaine: One of the other ways that his self confidence demonstrates itself is that he is constantly challenging people on the team to races. He's very competitive. Here's what the book says. It came in handy in workouts, especially where pre challenged the best runners of the school known for its distance runners. Pat Tyson, who was to become Steve's friend and roommate, recollects the feeling of team members toward the prodigy. Some were kind of envious, you might say. Yet at the same time, thought it was neat having him there. But that's the way it was at Oregon. You're friends, but when you're on the track, you're there to beat somebody else out. Steve was kind of above that though, because even as a freshman, he was at national caliber. Pree's biggest asset on the track was his competitive personality. Pree had to be number one in workouts. Okay. And then here's a, another quote from another teammate, Paul Geiss. Pre had to be number one in workouts. I remember another time when Scott might have blown by him at one. Pre had to be number one in workouts. I remember one time when Scott might've blown by him in one part of the workout. Three days later, Pre just obliterated him and he realized what had happened. Pre had gone home and for the next 48 hours had mentally prepared his case. There were many casualties left in his wake of people trying to keep up with him. Myself included. Okay. And I, I think that competitiveness, that, that love of competition, of wanting to prove that he's the best of comparing himself to others is another big secret of his success. So his freshman year, he is very good, but not the best. And he's the best on his team, but not in the nation. And then by his sophomore year, he is fully the man. Okay. After his freshman year, he only lost two races in college, both in the mile, which was his weakest race. He was generally better at longer distances. Okay. So three years, sophomore, junior, senior year. He only loses two races and he never loses a race, not a single race in his best events. The way he does this is different from most runners. So there are a few different strategies you can use for distance running. And one of them, what most people do is keep up a good pace, but", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/steve-prefontaine", "title": "Steve Prefontaine", "chunk_index": 9, "publication_date": "2024-07-18", "total_chunks_in_doc": 18}}

And one of them , what most people do is keep up a good pace , but Steve Prefontaine: stay with the pack. And then if you're one of the fastest guys, then you try and out sprint everyone. In at the very end on the last lap. And there are a lot of runners who excel that way. I think that's one of the more common strategies, but pre was not a great sprinter or a kicker as they call it. So his strategy was to go all out from the beginning in the three mile. He would run a very fast first and second mile, which people generally couldn't keep up with. And so he didn't have to sprint at the end and crowds really responded to this. This kid is just giving it his all for three straight miles. And one consequence of this strategy is he sets a lot of records. And part of it is that he's fast. Like you have to be fast to be able to set records. You know, there are some runners who might go for a record, you know, once a year or something like that. But for most of their races, they're going with this strategy of staying with the pack and then trying to out sprint everyone. And so they're just not running fast enough to set records. a record for the three mile. But that's one reason people loved watching pre run is, you know, his strategy every time was I'm running my fastest for all three miles. And so you never know when you might see a new college or us record because he's going all out on basically every race. So as a sophomore, once again, he is a phenomenon. He's famous this time nationally. They put them on the cover of sports illustrated, which was the big sports magazine in the U S at the time, people wore t shirts that said legend or go pre, uh, go pre as a shirt actually became so famous that some people started to wear shirts as a joke that said, stop pre,. He was also notable for taking victory laps. So he was like a natural showman. So after he had won, he would jog around the track and acknowledge the fans who were by this point cheering wildly. His teammates gave him the nickname world because he was famous worldwide. All right, hear that Pitbull, Steve Prefontaine, the original Mr. Worldwide. And he had this special relationship with the crowd who pre always referred to as his people. Okay. I love that, especially Coos Bay and Eugene, Oregon.

I love that , especially Coos Bay and Eugene , Oregon . He Steve Prefontaine: always called those people, his people. And he said, I want to perform well. For my people. Uh, reading now from the biography that man has something. No runner in my time had Bill Dellinger once Mused to Kenny Moore of Sports Illustrated. We used to warm up outta sight behind the stands, and we would never have considered taking a victory lap. But pre, he's almost like a movie star in his relationship with the crowd, he thrives on it For his people, the feeling was mystical. The last laps of his races were the most exciting moments I've ever experienced in viewing sports, is how one of Steve's fans summarized the feeling. The crowd was always on its feet. The excitement generated was riotous. The race was a victory for Pre's people as much for the runner himself. There will never be another sound like, Go Pre! There's no way the people of Eugene will ever forget Steve. Okay, so I just think this relationship is really special. Something I think a lot about is the idea of energy transfer. I try to be in a spot of heightened energy, When I record these episodes, because I believe that a big part of podcasting is simple energy transfer. If my energy is high, if I'm excited, then that rubs off and the energy transfers to you, to the audience. And it makes for a good listening experience. So I often go for a walk or do some pushups before recording, just to make sure my energy is high. And I think the inverse is true as well. You give energy off and then you get energy back from the audience. And that was true for Bri. From the book, quote, in that race, as in many others, Prefontaine appeared to derive a direct energy from the crowds he performed before. And so that's another takeaway for me. Make sure that you are in that heightened emotional state, that you have high energy when you're performing, because it's going to excite others, and then it kind of bounces back to you when you have heightened energy, it excites others, and then they excite you in turn. And it's a reinforcement. Loop, uh, that, that, that, and it's a reinforcement loop that just increases your performance. you know, competition is one of those things that was so crucial to Steve Prefontaine. It's what fueled him is what motivated him and competition is crucial in any pursuit.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/steve-prefontaine", "title": "Steve Prefontaine", "chunk_index": 11, "publication_date": "2024-07-18", "total_chunks_in_doc": 18}}

So as a sophomore, he's running college track meets at Oregon. He's also preparing for the 1972 Olympics in Munich. In the lead up, he sets the American record for the 10, 000 meter. And it seems like he's well positioned to contend for the gold in Munich. And now he was indisputably the fastest middle distance runner in the U S. But of course the Olympics are an entirely different beast. You have the best runners from all over the world. It's just a better level of competition. And so here pre would finally have the chance to show just how good he was. If you know anything about the Olympics of 1972, they were kind of a fiasco. Some Israeli athletes are kidnapped and end up dead. The disruption had a huge effect on Pri as well as his competitors. So the race gets moved back a few days when it does finally come time to race.

Quote, Veeran still led slightly, does his usual thing of pushing the pace from the get go. With two laps to go, he was in the lead. However, shortly thereafter, Three of his main competitors catch up with him, and so it's neck and neck between the four of them. And I'll let the book narrate what happened next. Viren still led slightly, with Pri behind him, and Gamaudi off Pri's right shoulder. At the top of the backstretch, with 300 meters left, Pri started to pull out to pass Viren, but Gamaudi, one of those cagey vets Pri was so aware of, moved instantly to cut him off before he could get past Viren. Chastened, Pri dropped behind Viren again, until the top of the last curve, when he tried to go again. And again, Gamowdy moved at the perfect moment to cut him off. Unable to pass, Steve finished fourth. The defeat was devastating. Okay. So Pri was in a position where he might have been able to win, to, to pass. So Pri was in a position where he might have been able to make a pass and actually win, but he was cut off. By another runner and kind of boxed in, uh, by these three front runners. And so he finishes fourth and doesn't medal. It's a, it's a very close fourth place finish. You know, these four runners are grouped together, but they kind of, yeah, box them in, cut them out. And, and he finishes without a medal. He complained about this, said it was unfair, said it was a dirty trick. But the truth is jockeying is a part of running and Pri himself wasn't above cutting off competitors and using positioning to keep them from getting ahead of him. Again, this finish was devastating for him. He was very competitive. He hated losing. It was one of his defining attributes. And this was losing in the biggest and most public way possible. You know, he's this big celebrity. He's a big phenomenon back in the United States. He had all these people watching the TV to see him win and he doesn't even medal.

Um , and you know , you got these older opponents . Steve Prefontaine: And they're resorting to cutting you out in order to win. You know, that's not much consolation to Briefontaine who was devastated. Well, he came home and resumed his college track career where, as I said, he didn't lose any more races. He won three national championships and set many more records. After college, he took a job with Nike. At the time, in order to qualify for the Olympics, you had to remain an amateur. And that meant you could not be sponsored. You couldn't receive any compensation. For your athletics, for your running in this case. And so pre you'd had a run in with the amateur athletic union, the AAU. They had gotten on his case and threatened to disqualify him because he had received free merchandise from Nike. At the time, most people were engaging in what was called sham mature athletics. Okay. Supposedly it's amateur athletics, but everyone knows it's a sham. They would take under the table payments. Everyone knew that the top athletes were being paid, but everyone had to keep up the pretense. That they weren't and pre was actually an outspoken opponent of the system, and he's one of the major voices that opposed it and led to reforms where athletes were allowed to be compensated and still compete in the Olympics, but his job with Nike was a not very discreet way to be paid for his running the position he took was national global relations manager. But like, you know, the idea, the agreement between him and Nike was, look, you take this job, you work a couple hours and we'll pay you to wear a merchandise and keep running. Essentially they're paying him even so, you know, in typical pre fashion, even though he was really just being paid to run, he throws himself into the job and actually does good work for Nike and gets on the road and does everything he can to promote the brand. Uh, so for example, he takes it upon himself to find the best runners and when they win stuff, he sends them Nike shoes and he, he talks with people and he really encourages other runners to try Nike and to get the shoes on the feet of the best runners so that. They can get more publicity. So, you know, he does everything, you know, he does everything all out. It's like Nike comes to him and says, yeah, just take this position. Really? You just have", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/steve-prefontaine", "title": "Steve Prefontaine", "chunk_index": 14, "publication_date": "2024-07-18", "total_chunks_in_doc": 18}}

It ' s like Nike comes to him and says , yeah , just take this position . Really ? You just have Steve Prefontaine: to keep running. He's like, but he can't help himself. He wants to do a good job of doing his job as well. Pre was actually offered a chance to go legit when he was offered a hundred thousand dollars a year to renounce his amateur status and compete in the ITA. Which was a burgeoning professional track organization and a hundred thousand dollars is good money. Now it was great money back then, especially for someone like Steve Brifontaine, who was essentially living hand to mouth. And so he really considers it, but at the end he turns it down because he still wanted a crack at the 1976 Olympics. So he doesn't join the ITA and he maintains his amateur status. He keeps working for Nike. So he graduates in 1974 and all through 1974, 1975. Five. Um, he's working for Nike, but he's also running in a lot of races. Uh, he's still competing. He's still maintaining his fitness. He's got his eyes on the Olympic and this time he really wants to medal. He wants his shot at,, he wants his shot at vindication. So in 1975, as part of this run up, he helps to organize a series of meets to promote running in Oregon and the Pacific Northwest. And he brings in some international runners and he himself runs the In front of a bunch of big crowds all throughout Oregon, Washington. On May 29th, 1975, he holds a meet at his home field in Eugene, Oregon. Steve won his race and had a wonderful day in front of his family and friends and the always adoring Eugene crowd. Afterwards, he went out with the other runners and had some drinks. And afterwards he went out with the other runners and had some drinks and he was out drinking and partying until well after midnight, uh, he was driving home from that party. When he took a turn too wide, he flipped his car, ran into a rock wall and was pinned underneath the wreckage. He was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics. He died officially on May 30th, 1975. He was 24 years old. So I know that was kind of sudden, right? And I wanted to do it that way because that is how his life was. I mean, it was this exciting buildup and he was doing great and he had this whole future ahead of him. And then, like that, he was dead.

{"text": "life was . I mean , it was this exciting buildup and he was doing great and he had this whole future ahead of him . And then , like that , he was dead . You know , for the people of Eugene , they couldn ' t believe Steve Prefontaine: it. They had just seen him running. And he was at the top of his form, and then they read the next day in the newspapers, he's dead, he's gone. And I think that is one of the reasons that he's such a legend. It's because this is someone who, you know, really never declined, never aged, like he was just great. And then he died while he was great. So what are my takeaways from the remarkable short life of Steve Prefontaine? First is that combination of for improving and succeeding at anything. First is that combination for improving and succeeding at anything. Intensity, the ability to take pain, and consistency. You do those three things together, and that is a very powerful combination. Okay, again, intensity. Obsession. And then the ability to take pain and just keep going through that pain to push past it, to, to want, crave, love the pain and then consistency. That was just, you know, every day, 6 00 AM running up partying 3 AM, three hours later, I'm up running. It doesn't matter if I'm sick. It doesn't matter if I'm not feeling the best. You know, he ran when he had injuries. Consistency. Unbelievable consistency. Never take a day off. The second takeaway is the gaze. Draw people in with the intensity of your gaze and focus in on others if you want to develop charisma. And then the third is to be naive when it comes to your limits. Believe in yourself instinctively. If you have limits, then let reality determine those, but don't listen to others, and certainly don't listen to your own self doubts when it comes to your limits. The rules of nature and physics will humble you, so don't do it to yourself prematurely. I'll finish with some quotes that I think capture the essence of Steve Prefontaine, who he was. The first is about the idea of being artistic and creating something beautiful, no matter what you do. Here's a quote from Steve Prefontaine himself, quote, some people create with words or with music or with a brush and paints. I like to make something beautiful when I run. I like to make people stop and say, I've never seen anyone run like that before. It's more than just a race. It's style is doing something better than anyone else. It's being creative.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/steve-prefontaine", "title": "Steve Prefontaine", "chunk_index": 16, "publication_date": "2024-07-18", "total_chunks_in_doc": 18}}

It ' s being creative . Steve Prefontaine: I'm Steve. The second quote is about letting that extend to everything you do. Here's a quote from Don Chapman, a reporter who covered pre extensively. If you ever saw pre run, you're lucky. The sight of him rounding that last turn and looking up at the clock will be forever frozen in my memory. The same is true of the way he scratched my dog's ears and muttered the silly things people say to dogs. Okay, I love that idea that somehow the same passion that was displayed when he ran was evident when he was simply scratching a dog behind the ears. Okay, everything that Steve Prefontaine did, he did all the way. And then the last quote is once again from Steve Prefontaine himself. Whenever he did youth camps or clinics, he would always end his speeches with the same line. He would talk about how everyone has a gift, some natural abilities or talent that they can share with the world. And he would end by saying, to give anything less than your best is to sacrifice the gift. Okay, that's it. Until next time, thank you for listening to How to Take Over the World. üìç One of my favorite stories about Steve Prefontaine is how he would save time. So he had this long hair that was part of his signature look. And during his twenties, his hair started to fall out. And he heard that massaging your scalp would increase blood flow to your scalp, which would stop your hair from falling out. So he would massage his scalp with his hands while he did sit ups to try and pack as much productivity in as possible. One of those things I do to be more productive is use Speechify. It turns anything into a podcast, articles, emails, books, even tweets. So anything I want to read that I don't have time for.

Well, in 1913 the guy is caught and the Mona Lisa was returned, somewhat reluctantly, I think, based on the fact that the guy spent less than a year in jail. There is good competition between France and Italy for who has the best taste. The best art, the best architecture, they are two of the treasures of Europe. Spain, Germany, the Low countries, and England also have great artistic contributions but I think France and Italy are probably the leaders in terms of European art and culture. And so of course there is some debate over who gets to claim Da Vinci. Because he was Italian, but the truth is, he was much more appreciated by the French who immediately embraced and loved him. Maybe that‚Äôs a little unfair to the Italians who did commission him, acknowledge him as a genius, the vast majority of his life was spent in either Florence, Milan, and Rome. and Milan may have been under French control for large portions of that but it was still an Italian city.

Machiavelli signs a contract for Da Vinci in May 1504 after they have left Borgia‚Äôs service. So the two were like legit homies. Which I love. I just get the biggest kick out of it. Pageantry is something he did throughout his entire life that is lost to time because of its ephemeral nature.

{"text": "Alexander the Great (Endnotes): Alexander the Great Endnotes Hello and welcome to another episode of How to Take Over the World. This is Ben Wilson. Special episode today, we‚Äôre doing the endnotes from the life of Alexander the Great. All of the thoughts I had, all of the random notes, all of the stuff that just barely missed the cut for getting into the main episodes is going to be here. It‚Äôs a little more free-flowing, and a little more loose. So on the list of topics that I‚Äôm going to cover, I‚Äôve got: What happened after Alexander‚Äôs death and the successor kingdoms Alexander‚Äôs sexuality If Alexander was Greek, why did he have blond hair and light eyes? A review of the Alexander the Great movie directed by Oliver Stone in 2004 And some other stuff here and there. So let‚Äôs jump in. ----- One thing I wanted to address is a question I got after last episode which is essentially ‚Äúso what made Alexander so great?‚Äù ‚Äç Why is what he did considered so much greater than what other general and conquerors have done? ‚Äç So I think the first thing that added to his mystique is that he was literally undefeated. He never lost a battle ever. And that‚Äôs not something that Caesar or Napoleon or most other great conquerors can say. ‚Äç The other thing is that the territory wasn‚Äôt that big but the power was. Because Greece was that powerful. That wealthy and successful and powerful. And so was Persia. So it‚Äôs not just that it was big in terms of land. It was like China and the US being united in a single country or something. ‚Äç I think part of the other part is that he was doing this in the style of an old war lord. He was literally charging in there and swinging a sword and through the strength of his arms and those of his companions, as well as through his charisma and diplomacy and strategic brilliance, he forged this unprecedented empire. ‚Äç So it‚Äôs not just what he did in having an undefeated record and creating what he did, it is that the person of Alexander is a uniquely impressive specimen. ‚Äç I‚Äôd like to read from the end of Arrian‚Äôs biography where he gives his assessment of Alexander‚Äôs character. ‚Äç ‚ÄúHe lived thirty-two yeard and eight months and reigned for twelve years and... eight months.

{"text": "Alexander ‚Äô s character . ‚Äç ‚Äú He lived thirty - two yeard and eight months and reigned for twelve years and . . . eight months . He had an extraordinary physical beauty and hardihood and an exceedingly shrewd and courageous spirit ; he was unsurpassed in his love Alexander the Great (Endnotes): of honor, his zest for danger, and his scrupulous attention to the rites of the gods‚Ä¶ He was extremely adept at seeing immediately what had to be done when it was not yet obvious, and was exceptionally good at guessing what was likely to happen based on the available evidence; he showed outstanding talent for drawing up, arming, and equipping an army. In raising his soldiers‚Äô morale, filling them with good hopes, and dispelling their fear in times of danger by his own fearlessness, he showed himself supremely gifted. All that needed to be done openly he did with the utmost courage, while in situations requiring stealth and speed he also excelled at getting the jump on his enemies before they suspected what was coming.‚Äù ‚Äç Okay so it wasn‚Äôt just what he accomplished, it was who he was. It was his good looks, his charisma, his courage, his honor, his grit, and his cleverness. That is what made him Alexander THE GREAT. ‚Äç ----- ‚Äç The next thing I want to talk about is the successor kingdoms. ‚Äç So just before Alexander dies, he says that the kingdom should go to the strongest. That‚Äôs actually a little too neat and most historians think that was a later invention, but whether or not it actually happened, it was a good summary of how things would turn out. ‚Äç So immediately there was a problem that people only wanted a blood relation of Alexander‚Äôs to be king. So there was his legitimate son, Alexander, who was actually not born yet, but his wife Roxanna was pregnant when he died, there was an illegitimate son that he had by his mistress Barsine, and that child‚Äôs name was Herakles. And then there was his mentally disabled brother, Arrhidaios. ‚Äç So the arrangement is supposed to be that a guy named Perdikkas, who was not powerful and had no real power base, would serve as the regent until Alexander‚Äôs son could come of age. ‚Äç The most powerful generals would all take separate satrapies and be governors, sort of under Perdikkas, but really as peers to him. ‚Äç Well the problem is that some of the borders of the empire start crumbling, especially in Afghanistan, which is famous as a graveyard of empires. Essentially the Macedonians and Greeks there start defecting saying ‚Äúscrew this, how long are you going to keep us posted at the end of the world?‚Äù and then the locals are rebelling, so Perdikkas calls on some of the satraps, these very powerful generals, from nearby regions to come help maintain", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/alexander-the-great-endnotes", "title": "Alexander the Great (Endnotes)", "chunk_index": 1, "publication_date": "2021-12-08", "total_chunks_in_doc": 7}}

You can‚Äôt tell us what to do. Perdikkas tries to attack these wayward generals but he fails and dies. ‚Äç So now you‚Äôve got all these independent regions led by these generals, who end up eventually declaring themselves kings. ‚Äç Back in Macedonia, good ol Antipater is still in charge and he‚Äôs protecting Alexander‚Äôs family. But he‚Äôs an old man, and he soon dies. He does something rather similar to Alexander, rather than leave the kingdom to his son, he leaves it to a nobody, an old veteran general named Polyperchon. ‚Äç We don‚Äôt know why he did it but it seems that the idea was to do something similar to what Alexander did. Leave a nobody in charge who will just hold the kingdom until Alexander‚Äôs son can come of age. ‚Äç But Antipater‚Äôs son, Cassander, was ambitious and did not go along with this, and overthrow this guy Polyperchon and had Alexander‚Äôs family imprisoned, and then years later had them quietly killed. ‚Äç And that was the tragic end of Alexander‚Äôs family. In terms of the other heirs of Alexander‚Äôs empire, it stabilized into four main kingdoms with some smaller around the edges. ‚Äç You had Cassander in Macedonia, who eventually gets taken over by a dynasty called the Antigonids. In Egypt you had the Ptolemy, and his descendants would be the most successful and long-lasting of the kingdoms. They ruled Egypt for hundreds of year - until Julius Caesar came along. And Cleopatra was a direct descendant of Ptolemy. ‚Äç In Persia you had the Seleucid empire and in Asia Minor you had Lysimachus, although this would eventually go to the Seleucid empire as well. ‚Äç So anyway, you have these successor kingdoms, the Seleucids, the Ptolemies, the Antigonids, and Lysimachus, and as soon as one of them gets powerful enough that they look like they could take over the entire thing and inherit Alexander‚Äôs empire, the other ones team up to defeat them and keep them in their place. ‚Äç And so Alexander‚Äôs empire is never reconstituted. But what the successor kingdoms did do was spread Hellenic culture and language throughout the Mediterranean and near east.

So obvious content warning if you are listening with children in the car or anything like that. ‚Äç And to start with we need to understand that Greek sexuality was very different from our own. The phrases straight, gay, and bisexual have no exact corresponding ancient Greek counterpart. ‚Äç And that‚Äôs because we tend to view sexuality as something that you are born with, that‚Äôs fixed. You are born either gay/lesbian, straight, or bisexual. ‚Äç The Greeks of Alexander‚Äôs age did not view sexuality that way. They tended to view being the passive partner in sex as feminine, and being the active partner as masculine, no matter who your partner was. ‚Äç And we should also add that female sexuality was not much discussed, the Greeks were quite misogynistic, even by ancient standards. Except for the Spartans actually, women were quite liberated in Sparta. ‚Äç That‚Äôs a simplification. There were also a lot of other rules and expectations that would be foreign to us. For example, homosexual sex between adult men was not common, it was expected that there should be at least 10 years between the senior and junior partner, and usually the junior partner was a minor. ‚Äç Which is obviously the inverse of the current day when homosexuality between adults is accepted and pedophilia is forbidden. ‚Äç And there are a lot of other assumptions abous sex and sexual nature that our society does not share with theirs. ‚Äç Okay so, when people ask the question ‚Äúwas Alexander the Great gay?‚Äù or ask ‚ÄúWas Alexander bisexual?‚Äù They‚Äôre asking the wrong question. ‚Äç ‚Äç He married three times and fathered two children and one miscarriage, suggesting a certain level of attraction to women. One of those children was fathered with a mistress, suggesting that it wasn‚Äôt all just performing duty and there was at least some level of genuine attraction toward women. ‚Äç We also knew that he carried on an affair with a male, a eunuch named Bagoas, while he was in Persia. We also have reports of his mother being concerned when Alexander was in early adulthood that he was overly fond of boys and not sufficiently interested in women.

{"text": "women . Arrian , who I think is the most reliable , doesn ‚Äô t mention these rumors , but he was quite friendly in his portrayal of Alexander so it doesn ‚Äô t mean that the rumors are completely untrue . ‚Äç In any case , what we can Alexander the Great (Endnotes): say is that Alexander had sexual relationships with both men and women. And that he would have rejected whatever modern labels we tried to put on him. ‚Äç One of the most intense relationships of his life was with his childhood best friend Hephaestion. And many have suggested that this was a sexual relatinoship or have even sought to portray them as boyfriends or something of that nature. ‚Äç That is a mistake. It‚Äôs possible that their relationship had a sexual component, especially when they were younger, but that wasn‚Äôt the basis of their relationship. Friendship and companionship. It was a way more intense friendship than we are used to. ‚Äç Hephaestion is also Alexander. Reminds me of David and Jonathan in the Bible, David says ‚Äúmy love for you surpasses that of women.‚Äù And people have taken that as a not-so coded reference to homosexuality but I think this is also a mistake. It‚Äôs just a mega intense friendship, and I find it tragic that our culture no longer understands these. ‚Äç And again just to reiterate, I‚Äôm not saying that Alexander and Hephaestion‚Äôs relationship was definitely not romantic or sexual, just that if it was, that was not the defining nature of their relationship, and it is likely that they would have found it very offensive and demeaning to their relationshi for it to be boiled down to a romantic affair. ‚Äç ----- ‚Äç Okay next on the list I am going to review the Alexander the Great movie directed by Oliver Stone in 2004. ‚Äç See notes. ‚Äç ---- ‚Äç The last thing I want to talk about is a question that I got asked which is ‚ÄúWhy was Alexander light haired and light eyed.‚Äù And I think the implication here is that if you know many Greeks, they are not typically blond haired and blue eyed so if Alexander was a Greek, or you know as a Macedonian he was Greek-adjacent, why didn‚Äôt he look like the Greeks I know. ‚Äç Okay so a few things, first of all I would call the Macedonians Greek. Basically all the ethnic Macedonians got rolled up into the Greek nation and ethnicity over the following centuries. Same thing with those who were from Epirus and pretty much every other people who spoke a Greek-like language. ‚Äç Okay so why doesn‚Äôt he look like a Greek. ‚Äç Well, Greece had been inhabited by a number of peoples, most notably the Minoans, who were what you might call indigenous Europeans.

And then they were invaded by a Northern European people called the Mycaneans Alexander the Great (Endnotes): or Mykaneans. Mycanean is the more common pronunciation. ‚Äç And these guys were Indo-Europeans, Hitler‚Äôs famous Aryans, though he was mostly wrong about them. So they brought the Greek language and they founded a ruling class in Greece. Now, by the time Alexander comes along, it is hundreds of years after the Mycanean takeover of Greece and by Alexander‚Äôs time, the native population and the Mycaneans had mixed to form what is the Greek ethnicity. ‚Äç But it is likely that some structural inequities would have endured, to use modern parlance, and so it is probably likely that aristocratic Greeks like Alexander would have been somewhat more likely to have light hair and light eyes than commoners, though there was certainly nothing like racial segregation or a formal racial caste system or anything like that. ‚Äç But as we know, light hair and light eyes are recessive, so as time goes on, it is likely for those attributes to fade from the gene pool. In addition, the Greeks went along mixing with their neighbors, especially their neighbors in modern day Turkey, and so they have done genetic tests on bronze-age Greek skeletons and they had slightly more similarity to northern europeans than modern Greeks do. ‚Äç You have to be careful when you bring this up because Hitler and the NAZIs had this theory that every great European was an ARYAN, was an Indo-Europoean, and that the Greeks were great when they were Aryan and pure, but they went and mixed their blood with other populations and that is why they‚Äôre no longer as politically powerful as they once were. ‚Äç And to be clear that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying. And I‚Äôm not saying that Alexander was a pure Aryan or anything stupid like that. But it is clear that someone like Alexander would have had more steppe ancestry, which is to say Indo-European ancestry, than modern Greeks, and that is why he probably had a lighter complexion than most modern Greeks. ‚Äç You can see a similar thing in the Visigothic invasion of Spain. The Visigoths were a German tribe, full of blondies and blue-eyed people. And they invaded Spain and set up a kingdom for themselves there. It‚Äôs why Spanish has a Germanic word for cheese, queso, whereas most other romance languages have a word like fromage or formaggi. ‚Äç But despite this big Germanic invasion, how many blond-haired blue-eyed Spaniards do you know?

{"text": "Mini-Episode: Quid Non and Bloom's Two Sigma Problem: Hello and welcome to How to Take Over the World. This is Ben Wilson, and this week I'm doing a mini episode. I'm neck deep in research about the British Navy and the famous Admiral Horatio Nelson, episode one of that series will be coming next week. But in the meantime, I just wanted to drop a brief mini episode. On other things that I'm researching. So in addition to reading all these biographies and all the research I do for the main episodes, sometimes I wander down other rabbit holes. And so I thought I would share Some of the other things that I've been learning about and thinking about, this week while, while we wait for the main episode. So I got two things this week. One is something that I came across while doing background research on the British Navy in order to get ready for this upcoming episode on Lord Nelson. And I came across a character named Sir Humphrey Gilbert. And as you're researching the British Navy, you come across a lot of these figures, these classic Elizabethan English adventurers. The most famous one is Sir Francis Drake. And this guy's kinda like that. So he fights the French at La hra. He then fights the Irish, he gets elected to Parliament. He fights the Spanish in the Netherlands. , he founds Gresham College. He's like a real rough character. So he brawls with a gentleman and seriously injures him. Uh, and he murders someone in an argument. , So you see he's got this kinda interesting character in that he's a man of words. He's very literary. He's a great writer and he founds this college, but he's also like a rough character who fights. He's an explorer. He is one of the big early figures in trying to. Discover the northwest passage in Canada. So this is trying to find a sea route north of Canada through there to, to get to Asia. He's unable to find it because it doesn't exist. Uh, he goes a little bit crazy and then decides to go down with his ship on the return journey, yelling as the ship goes down. We are as near to heaven by sea as by land. So he's this kinda larger than life crazy character. , A little bit feckless, but very brave and daring. And I like him. I really like learning about him. But one of the reasons I wanted to bring him up is he has", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/mini-episode-quid-non-and-blooms-two-sigma-problem", "title": "Mini-Episode: Quid Non and Bloom's Two Sigma Problem", "chunk_index": 0, "publication_date": "2023-06-17", "total_chunks_in_doc": 7}}
{"text": "So he ' s this kinda larger than life crazy character . , A little bit feckless , but very brave and daring . And I like him . I really like learning about him . But one of the reasons I wanted to bring him up is he has Mini-Episode: Quid Non and Bloom's Two Sigma Problem: this personal motto, which I love. It has become something of a motto for me as well. So he created a flag, a banner, a personal banner, and on it he had the words written quid non, which is Latin for why not. I'm sure Alex Petkus can correct my pronunciation of the Latin, but I like that quid non, why not? And I love that motto cuz it makes me think that there are two types of people in the world. There are those who, when they're presented with a plan or something ambitious, ask why. And then there are those who ask why not. And the people who ask why are the ones who are safe , And don't have to suffer a lot of risk, but they don't accomplish much either. And the people who ask why not are the people who fail and fall flat on their face like Humphrey Gilbert often did, but they're also the people who accomplish things. They do the adventure, they start the business, they make the speech, they do the thing, they take the risk. And so sometimes when I'm facing something scary, I'm tempted to ask myself, why? Why do this? Why go through with it? Why risk it? Why put myself through this? And so a mental model that I have taken from this guy, Humphrey Gilbert, is to flip that on its head. And ask myself, why not instead? And when I do that, , when I ask myself, oh, what's the worst that could happen? Why not? Why not Go for it. I'm more inclined to take those risks and to undertake projects that ultimately help me progress. So maybe that is one mental model that is helpful to you and a motto that you can adopt as well. Why not? The other thing that is pretty unrelated to the episode I'm doing right now is something about genius education. So you might know that's something I'm interested in. I did an episode on this guy Laszlo Polgar. He was an education researcher in Hungary, in Budapest, and he decided to implement his findings and he raised his three daughters to be chess masters and it worked out marvelously. All three of them were great , and in fact, one of 'em was the greatest female chess player of all time. And so that's one of my hobby horses.

I ' ve got young children and I ' m trying to figure out what Mini-Episode: Quid Non and Bloom's Two Sigma Problem: I'm gonna do for their education. I also started thinking about education this last week because if you listen to that, Steve Jobs part three episode, my go down a little thing there on education. He had a quote about how he didn't have great experience in his K through 12 education system. So I was thinking about this last week. I was thinking about genius education. You know, these people like the Polgar sisters, like Tiger Woods, Mozart, Andre Agassi, Picasso, uh, these people that started really young and were able to accomplish really great things in their lives. And I came across this thing called Bloom's two Sigma problem, and I found the results of this study fascinating. So, Benjamin Blum was an education researcher who lived and worked mainly in the Midwest in the us. But he was one of the seminal academics in coming up with theories for testing proficiency in students and best practices in instruction in how to teach students. And one of the things Bloom was known for was his analysis of this study on a group of students that were in fourth, fifth, and eighth grade. And they took these students and divided them into three groups. And in one group, they just kept normal education. They just. Went to school, went to class every day. The second group. They put in something called mastery education, this, this different form of instruction. And then for the third group, they gave them tutors. And so they had full-time instruction from tutors. So they test all three groups at the beginning, and they were all average, which is what they should be, right? That's what average means. So the median student scored about, in the 50th percentile in all three groups. And so then they go through, they do, um, I think it's just six or seven weeks of education in these three different styles. And then they tested them again at the end of the experiment, , to see. How they did. And so the students that got normal education continued to be averaged. They continued to be in the 50th percentile. , those in the mastery, education group, , did a little bit better. And then the students that were tutored full-time for six or seven weeks, They performed more than two standard deviations better than the normal students. So that means that the average student in that group, the average tutored student performed in the 98th percentile compared to the control group.

So that means that the average student in that group , the average tutored student performed in the 98th percentile compared to the control group . And that is an absolutely huge Mini-Episode: Quid Non and Bloom's Two Sigma Problem: effect size. You basically never get effect sizes that large in studies in social sciences. It's an insane result. Like there, there's no other intervention that you can find. That leads to that drastic of a result, basically. And by the way, it's called the Two Sigma problem because Bloom realized that this was a problem because you can't just one-on-one tutor every kid in, in the nation, right? That's way too expensive. That's not a realistic intervention. And so the problem is he's trying to figure out, well, what other things could we do that would give us a similar result that might be cheaper and. He went through, he tested a bunch of things. Some he found an effect, but nothing nearly as large as, uh, tutoring as this two sigma effect. And, um, in the subsequent years, I think this was in the, the seventies, the 1970s, maybe 1960s, that this study was done. And in the intervening time, people have tried to replicate this result. And when they compare tutoring, full-time tutoring to full-time normal classroom education, what they find is that it does indeed have an enormous effect. Not two Sigmas big. Uh, it's generally a little smaller, so that seems to be a little bit of an outlier. And part of it is the way the study was designed. He had them do tutoring with this mastery education. A style of teaching, so maybe that contributed. But anyway, it's been replicated many times the results are clear. It's maybe not two sigmas in reality, but it's probably more like one to one and a half standard deviations. There actually was one study by darpa, which is this advanced research arm of the US military, and they used a digital tutor. To automatically assess students' abilities and then adapt to teach 'em the things that they hadn't mastered yet. And they actually found an effect larger than two standard deviations. So using this, this type of software that they had developed, , they found an effect that was larger than two standard deviations. And only took half the time to instruct the students as a regular classroom setting. So, um, there are certain circumstances under which tutoring could actually be larger than, , a two standard deviation difference in terms of the outcomes.

So as I ' m reading this study , I ' m thinking to myself , huh , Mini-Episode: Quid Non and Bloom's Two Sigma Problem: I wonder how much this explains. People like the Polgar people like the William Sisters Venus and Serena Williams, two of the greatest women's tennis players of all time. Their father was intent on his girls becoming tennis stars. And so he started tutoring them, teaching them tennis one-on-one when they were four and a half years old. And he worked with them personally, taught them himself. And then when they got too good for him to continue coaching them, he got them coaches to continue that education. And so you look at that and you say, wow. So that's very similar to the Polgar sisters, very similar to Tiger Woods, who, who similarly, like when he was three, his father started him playing golf and one-on-one instructed him. So I start to think how much of that is just, wow, okay, you're getting a result. That is one standard, maybe one and a half standard deviations better than. Normal classroom instruction or if you're looking at it in terms of athletics, you know, maybe, uh, a team setting. So you're getting a, a standard deviation or more better, and you're letting that compound over years and years and years over decades. Right? 10, 20 years until the 30 years, I guess, until their careers usually, usually are over. so I do think it, it comes down a lot of it to that. I think if you go back and listen to that Polgar episode, I pull out a lot of the lessons that. He says Work ingenious education, , in his book Raise a Genius. And I think those are worth studying, but I really think if you can only learn one thing and you really want, uh, your, your children to learn and be ahead, the one thing to learn is tutoring lots and lots of tutoring. And that is going to put them way, way ahead. It also makes me think that tutoring is way, way undervalued. A lot of people will do tutoring for like an hour or two per week. I know very few people who are doing full-time tutoring and you know, I, I start to think back to these stories that I have studied and realize, wow, tutoring is actually really common.

And you know , by the way , one of his tutors was Aristotle , so maybe Mini-Episode: Quid Non and Bloom's Two Sigma Problem: that is something that helped him be great. , you know, Caesar had his own tutors. That is how young Roman aristocrats were educated. Uh, Thomas Edison was homeschooled by his very well educated, very intelligent mother. And so he was basically tutored as well, uh, for, for his education. The five rothchilds were taught finance, not in school or university, but personally one-on-one by their father while apprenticing, for him and working in his shop. And so I think that this is something that is way undervalued is the power. Of this one-on-one personal tutoring, and I see a lot of really wealthy people pay to send their children to elite private schools. And I'm sure those private schools do a lot of things Great. I, I think one of the big things is that they just get to associate with other well-to-do and very intelligent people, but in terms of just the education, you know, they're still getting basically a normal classroom education and the money that they spend on those private schools, if they're just thinking about the education. Aspect of it would probably be much better spent on full-time tutoring for their child. And by the way, I'm talking about all this with children and their education, but I don't think it's just children. I think adults could really benefit from more tutoring as well. Like, uh, golf and tennis are basically the only two places where adults spend good money on considerable amounts of tutoring. I think people who have the means should have tutors for lots of things. You know, I know so many people who are entrepreneurs, who are executives, who have a lot of money, have plenty of money, and they're still trying to do Duolingo on their own by themselves. They're still trying to learn coding by doing Googling and taking a course online. So, And once you see this research, you realize, oh, actually they would learn so much faster if in trying to learn a foreign language or trying to learn Python or trying to learn to, you know, code in whatever way.

{"text": "one tutoring per week . I think that greatly accelerates learning as an adult as well . On the podcast , my first million , Sean Puri , Sampa , one of the things they talked about their like goals for 2023 was more coaching . They found that coaching Mini-Episode: Quid Non and Bloom's Two Sigma Problem: was really effective and a number of aspects of their life. So one of the things they wanted to spend money on was coaching. They thought it was, was really worth it. And I think that's kind of a validation of this idea that you get this huge effect from one-on-one tutoring, from one-on-one coaching. . And so that's a really effective way to spend your money if, if you wanna learn. Um, okay, that's it this week. Special thanks and a shout out to Jose Luis Recon. Fernandez de LaPuente. What a name of the Nint till blog. I stole a bunch of his excellent research for that stuff on Bloom's two Sigma problem and the power of tutoring. So, uh, I'll link up his blog post if you wanna learn more about that. That's a deep dive where he goes into all the research about tutoring and mastery education and, , what all the studies say. So if you're interested in that, click on that link. Okay, that's it for this week. Remember, why not ask yourself, why not? And do yourself a favor, go find yourself a tutor. Go find yourself a coach, and supercharge your learning. üìç Until next time, thanks for listening to How to Take Over the World ‚Äç", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/mini-episode-quid-non-and-blooms-two-sigma-problem", "title": "Mini-Episode: Quid Non and Bloom's Two Sigma Problem", "chunk_index": 6, "publication_date": "2023-06-17", "total_chunks_in_doc": 7}}
{"text": "Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible: üìç üìç üìç üìç üìç üìç She's going, boys. I think it's time to get off. The ship was breaking up. She was being crushed. Not all at once, but slowly, a little at a time. The pressure of 10 million tons of ice was driving in against her sides. And, dying as she was, she cried in agony. Her frames and planking, her immense timbers, many of them almost a foot thick, screamed as the killing pressure mounted. And when her timbers could no longer stand the strain, they broke with a report like artillery fire. üìç üìç When Ernest Shackleton had set out with a crew of 27 men, he had hoped to cross Antarctica. Unusually bad conditions meant that their ship was slowly hemmed in, and eventually trapped in the middle of a giant ice flow, miles from the coast of Antarctica. Nevertheless, for months, hope had persisted. There might be some way to get the ship loose, and either make for the Antarctic coast, or at least sail back for the safety of üìç home. The realization that the ship would not escape the ice flow came on gradually, and then all at once. The men hastily constructed a camp, and then watched as pressure from the ice flows tore the ship to shreds. As the mast cracked and crumbled and the ship slowly disappeared under the ice, the men of the endurance took stock of their situation. It was 1915. They were hundreds of miles from civilization in one of the most inhospitable places on earth with limited supplies. Everything about their situation was uncertain. They didn't even have solid ground beneath their feet. And their ever changing location as the ice floes moved made üìç forecasting a future or making a plan very difficult. They had some sledges and some snow dogs to pull them with, they had three lifeboats, and they had their own skills and will to live. And they would need it. As they stared out toward the bleak white horizon, as they considered the cold and the lack of supplies, their own unsteady position and their isolation, one thing became terribly clear. They were all likely to die out here. üìç Hello, and welcome to How to Take Over the World. This is Ben Wilson.

{"text": "Shackleton , the great British adventurer and explorer . Today , in particular , we ' re going to explore the story of the Endurance . That is his ship that he took toward Antarctica with the intent of crossing the continent . But , as you heard in that Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible: introduction, it got caught in the ice and it's a great story of overcoming and survival. Shackleton is one of the classic stories of great leadership. There are Shackleton seminars where you can learn to lead like him. There have been many books written about him, specifically about the story of üìç the endurance and about his leadership style. And it's easy to see why he has generated so much interest when you study him. There's a great quote from one of his men who compares him to other explorers of the era. And he explains what set him apart. This guy says, For scientific leadership, give me Scott. That's another explorer. For swift and efficient travel, Amundsen. But when you are in a hopeless situation, when there seems no way out, get down on your knees and pray for Shackleton. And so that's one of the things to learn from Shackleton, how to lead in difficult circumstances, in a seemingly üìç hopeless situation. How to defy the odds, how to inspire people to do the impossible. It's also an incredible adventure story, just unbelievable. A great story of the human capacity to survive despite unbelievably difficult circumstances. üìç My sources for this episode were Endurance, Shackleton's Incredible Voyage by Alfred Lansing. That is the one I will be pulling from the most. It's actually one of the best books I have ever read. Incredibly well written, um, and a great account of one of the greatest stories of all time. Another source I use is Shackleton's own account called South, The Story of Shackleton's Last Expedition. And then I also reference a little bit Shackleton by Ronald Fiennes, although not so much. That one covers his whole life, and in this episode I'm going to be mostly talking about the story of the Endurance, but I cited a couple times. Okay, with all that said, let's get into it. This is the story of Ernest üìç Shackleton and the Endurance. Ernest Shackleton was born in County Kildare, Ireland, on February 15th, 1874. He was üìç the second of 10 children. And like many of the people we cover on this podcast, he was not considered bright as a child. He did really poorly in school. And this reminds me of many other people, Thomas Edison, for example, did poorly in school. His school teacher called him adult thought he was just dumb. Uh, üìç similarly, Mr. Beast was a terrible student and he thought he", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/ernest-shackleton-enduring-the-impossible", "title": "Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible", "chunk_index": 1, "publication_date": "2024-04-22", "total_chunks_in_doc": 33}}
{"text": "school . And this reminds me of many other people , Thomas Edison , for example , did poorly in school . His school teacher called him adult thought he was just dumb . Uh , üìç similarly , Mr . Beast was a terrible student and he thought he Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible: wasn't very bright growing up. I haven't done an Elon Musk episode yet, but similarly, his teachers did not think that he was all that bright as a child. And what all these people share in common is a very addictive personality that makes it difficult for them to focus on things that they are not interested in. And that was Shackleton as well. He was, of course, very üìç smart, but he had this intense will, this intense desire to do what he was interested in. And so he was a voracious reader, but only when it came to reading things that he wanted to read. And he could hardly be bothered to read or study other things, things that he was assigned in school. üìç And that meant that, yes, he was a poor student. He didn't get very good grades and he really struggled in the education system. He always had a thirst for adventure and exploration. So he joined the merchant Navy. As I mentioned, he was in fact quite intelligent, as well as enterprising, curious, and good with people. So he rose quickly once he became a sailor. In his early thirties, he made a name for himself on the Nimrod expedition, where he, along with his companions, tried to reach the South Pole. They ran üìç out of food and were able to make it, but they reached further south than any person ever had, and it was a major success. Upon his return to England, he became a major celebrity and was knighted. He was now Sir Ernest Shackleton. So this happens in 1908, when Shackleton is 34 years old, and he was beaten to the South Pole just a short time later by the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen. And so Shackleton is a celebrity, he's accomplished a lot, but he is kind of disappointed from this loss to Amundsen. And so he comes up with a üìç plan. He can't be the first man to the South Pole, but he can be the first man to cross Antarctica, the whole continent. So he'll land on one side, sledge across the entire continent, Uh, you know, using a sled, pulled by sled dogs, and then get picked up on the other side of the continent by a different ship. And Shackleton pitches it as an opportunity to regain Britain's honor. They had been beaten to the North Pole by the Americans, beaten to the South Pole by the Norwegians, but this would be an even more impressive accomplishment than either of", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/ernest-shackleton-enduring-the-impossible", "title": "Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible", "chunk_index": 2, "publication_date": "2024-04-22", "total_chunks_in_doc": 33}}
{"text": "different ship . And Shackleton pitches it as an opportunity to regain Britain ' s honor . They had been beaten to the North Pole by the Americans , beaten to the South Pole by the Norwegians , but this would be an even more impressive accomplishment than either of Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible: those. Shackleton wrote, From the sentimental point of view, it is the last great polar journey that can be made. It will be a greater journey than the journey to the Pole and back, and I feel it is up üìç to the British nation to accomplish this, for we have been beaten at the conquest of the North Pole, and beaten at the first conquest of the South Pole. There now remains the largest and most striking of all journeys, the crossing of the continent. So Lansing comments, he says, The plan was typical Shackleton, purposeful, bold, and neat. He had not the slightest doubt that the expedition would achieve its goal. The whole undertaking was criticized in some circles as being too audacious. And perhaps it was, but if it hadn't been audacious, it wouldn't have been to Shackleton's liking. He was above all an explorer in the classic mold, utterly self reliant, romantic, and just a little swashbuckling. Okay. I like that description, especially the use of the word purposeful. Okay. So he says the plan was typical of Shackleton and the first word that he uses is üìç purposeful. And that was actually Shackleton's defining characteristic. Here's another quote from Lansing. He says, whatever his mood, Whether it was gay and breezy or dark with rage, he had one pervading characteristic. He was purposeful. And we'll come back to this later, but I think that explains Shackleton's leadership more than any other characteristic. Purposefulness. He never forgot what the main objective was, and he was really great at focusing and shutting out anything else. So he's got this plan to cross Antarctica. Uh, but what do you need? Well, the first thing he needs is a crew for the journey. There's an urban legend üìç of a job posting that Shackleton puts out for his crew. Maybe you've seen it. Uh, here's the supposed ad. It says men wanted for hazardous journey, low wages, bitter, cold, long hours of complete darkness, safe return, doubtful, but Honor and recognition in event of success. And it turns out this never happened. There is no evidence of this job posting ever existing. And the simple reason it never existed is Shackleton never had to seek out a crew. Here's what Lansing writes about what really happened when Shackleton announced the idea for this expedition. He says, Finding volunteers to take part in the expedition proved simple.

{"text": "it never existed is Shackleton never had to seek out a crew . Here ' s what Lansing writes about what really happened when Shackleton announced the idea for this expedition . He says , Finding volunteers to take part in the expedition proved simple . When Shackleton announced his Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible: plans, he was deluged by more than 5, 000 applications from persons, including three girls, who asked to go along. Almost without exception, these volunteers were motivated solely by the spirit of adventure, for the salaries offered were little more than token payments for the services expected. They ranged from about 240 a year for an able seaman to 750 a year for the most experienced scientists. Okay, so the job posting is fake, but the idea is actually kind of true. People signed up in the thousands for a job with low wages, bitter, cold, long hours of complete darkness and low chances of a safe return because they were attracted to the excitement of this expedition. And I think that goes to show the impact of having an exciting vision. People want to be a part of it. They have this craving to do something bigger than themselves. I find his interviewing style very curious. So he's got, you know, 5, 000 people that he needs to get through. And I can't think of anyone else who I've studied who conducted interviews like Shackleton did. Listen to this, again from Lansing. He says, In the matter of selecting newcomers, Shackleton's methods would appear to be almost capricious. If he liked the look of a man, he was accepted. If he didn't, the matter was closed. And these decisions were made with lightning speed. There is no record of any interview that Shackleton conducted with a prospective Expedition member lasting more than five minutes. And I guess, if this style speaks to anything, it's trusting your instinct. Because, as it turns out, this wild process for interviewing turns out to be very successful. Shackleton puts together a great crew of 27 men who would turn out to perform admirably under incredibly trying circumstances. And there are some great stories from these interviews of the types of things that he asked. So, here's one. It says, Leonard Hussey, an irrepressible, peppery little individual, was signed on as meteorologist, even though he had practically no qualifications for the position at the time. Shackleton simply thought Hussie, quote, looked funny. And the fact that he had recently returned from an expedition as an anthropologist to the Torrid Sudan appealed to Shackleton's sense of whimsy. Hussie immediately took an intensive course in meteorology and later proved to be very proficient. Another one. Dr. Alexander Macklin, one of the two surgeons, caught Shackleton's fancy by replying when Shackleton asked him why he was wearing", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/ernest-shackleton-enduring-the-impossible", "title": "Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible", "chunk_index": 4, "publication_date": "2024-04-22", "total_chunks_in_doc": 33}}
{"text": "s sense of whimsy . Hussie immediately took an intensive course in meteorology and later proved to be very proficient . Another one . Dr . Alexander Macklin , one of the two surgeons , caught Shackleton ' s fancy by replying when Shackleton asked him why he was wearing Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible: glasses, quote, many a wise face would look foolish without spectacles. And Reginald James was signed on as physicist after Shackleton inquired about the state of his teeth, whether he suffered from varicose veins, if he was good tempered, and if he could sing. At the last question, James looked puzzled. Oh, I don't mean any Caruso stuff, Shackleton reassured him. But I suppose you can shout a bit with the boys, despite the instantaneous nature of these decisions, Shackleton's intuition for selecting compatible men rarely failed. Okay. So these are the kinds of questions that he's asking people in five minutes. Can you imagine this? Like you, it's only a crew of 27 people. They are obviously going to have your life in their hands. Like you're really going to be relying on these men. And he's asking them, uh, so why do you wear glasses? And, um, how are your teeth? Uh, do you have any varicose veins? And do you like to sing? Um, This is the kind of stuff that mattered to him. And, uh, I think actually what he's going for is look on a trip to Antarctica. We are really going to be cooped up in the ship for a long time. And so we really need to get along. And so that's all I need to know. Like, do I like you? And I can figure that out in five minutes. So that's how he does it. Shackleton had more difficulty with finding funding for the trip than he does finding manpower. But he eventually does get the money squared away. He acquires a ship, lays out the plans and gets everything prepared. And one of the things he obviously has to prepare for and get squared away is the victualing, the food. He spends a lot of time figuring out what they are going to eat, how much of it they're going to need, and how they're going to get it. But luckily, you don't have to think about any of that because you can just order meals through Factor. They make healthy meals that you can microwave for two minutes and boom, you're done.

So the ship that Shackleton acquires had originally been named the Polaris, but he renames it the Endurance because of his family motto, by endurance we conquer. And I love it. That's, that's a great motto, by endurance we conquer. I'm just gonna keep going until I win. But at the last minute, he is thrown a curveball. He's got the ship, he's got everything prepared, and a World War One breaks out right before they're supposed to leave. He and the crew wonder, if they should just abandon the journey in order to assist their country, their patriots. And so they think, I mean, is this the time to be, you know, taking all these, uh, you know, healthy, capable men and, and taking them out of the field? So they send a letter to the government inquiring whether they should call the whole thing off. And they are sent a one word response, proceed. And Winston Churchill himself later sends a longer letter explaining why the government wished for them to proceed with the journey instead of coming to help fight the war. So, with those instructions in hand, the Endurance sets sail from England on August 8th, 1914. Their first stop is Buenos Aires, Argentina, where they pick up 69 sled dogs and, unknown to Shackleton, one stow away. Shackleton is really upset when he finds out about this. I mean, he had laid out all these plans very carefully, right? The food down to the day. I mean, of course they had a little slack, right? But he's planning on a certain number of people And so, you know, this throws a wrench into his plans. And for no good reason, just because a few of the men thought it would be fun and funny. The stowaway's name was Blackboro and Shackleton screams at him, really lays into him and then gives him an ominous half joking, but not really", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/ernest-shackleton-enduring-the-impossible", "title": "Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible", "chunk_index": 6, "publication_date": "2024-04-22", "total_chunks_in_doc": 33}}

The stowaway ' s name was Blackboro and Shackleton screams at him , really lays into him and then gives him an ominous half joking , but not really Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible: joking threat. Uh, it says Shackleton paused abruptly and put his face up close to Blackboro's. Finally, he thundered. If we run out of food and anyone has to be eaten, you will be first. Do you understand? A smile slowly spread over Blackborough's round, boyish face, and he nodded. So after leaving Buenos Aires, they head south, and they make their last stop at a remote outpost called South Georgia Island. It's a small, rocky island just outside the Antarctic Circle. There was a whaling outpost there, so it was the last chance for them to resupply, gather news, and have contact with civilization before setting off for Antarctica. But the news they got at South Georgia was not good. They're asking the whalers, you know, what are things like, how are conditions, um, the intent was to sail through the Weddell Sea. is what it's called. And so, uh, you can think of it as like a giant bay, almost, uh, that the continent of Antarctica forms. Because the Weddell Sea is protected by the continent from, you know, currents and waves and things like that, it's very still. It's a sea. And so it has a propensity to gather these huge ice flows. You know, the ice just kind of hangs out and stays there. It makes it really difficult to get through. Well, this year it was really full of ice. You know, the, the whalers tell them that the conditions in the wettle sea were worse than they had ever seen in all the years that they had been there. But I mean, you know, if you're Shackleton, what are you going to do with a world war in full swing, if they turn back now, it could be years before they have a chance to return, if ever. This is their shot. And so on December 5th, 1914, the Endurance sets out from South Georgia. Almost immediately, the conditions in the Weddell Sea conspired to make their journey impossible. December is the middle of the summer in the southern hemisphere. And this was intentional. They were trying to go through during the summer when the ice flows were at their lowest and most navigable. But at every turn, they encountered more and more impassable ice.

{"text": "But at every turn , they encountered more and more impassable ice . Journey , quote , It was as though the spirits of the Antarctic were pointing us to the backward track , the one track we were determined not to follow . Just over a month later , Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible: they were able to navigate themselves to within sight of land. By February, the Endurance found itself trapped in the middle of an enormous ice flow. It being the southern summer, much of the ice was young and mushy. And so for weeks, multiple attempts were made to break out, to push through, to, you know, they would get out of the ship and use picks, saws, and shovels to break up the ice and then try and, you know, sail forward and cut through, cut a passage, but all to no avail. By February 24th, Shackleton realized that they were truly trapped and that the Endurance would need to winter where they were. Summer was turning to fall, and the young ice that had impeded them was freezing and gathering, cementing them in place. As one of the crew put it, the endurance was frozen like an almond in the middle of a chocolate bar. Lansing says that, quote, Among the men, the realization that the endurance was really beset for good came very slowly, like a kind of creeping resignation, a bad dream from which there was no waking. Anxiously, they watched each day, but the face of the pack remained substantially unchanged. This itself was not necessarily cause for panic. Though frozen in place, the endurance was upright, and not completely uncomfortable. Obviously, Antarctica is very cold, but the ship had extremely thick walls that made it really well insulated. So, like, yes, it was cold, but inside the ship, with proper clothing and a little bit of heat, conditions were not that bad. And there were also plenty of supplies that could last them through the winter, and these could be supplemented by hunting seals and penguins. The hunting was actually quite easy, because in the Antarctic, seals and penguins have no land predators, or, you know, ice surface predators. Only sea predators, like killer whales and sharks. So when a human approached, they just stood there and watched until the hunter closed in for the kill. Sometimes they didn't even have to shoot them, they would just club them over the head. And so with this hunting and their supplies, food's not a concern. At first, the primary preoccupation was with where the endurance would end up, the ice flow that they were trapped in was being pushed by wind and current. Lansing says, quote, the endurance was one microcosmic speck, 144 feet long and 25 feet wide, embedded in nearly 1 million square miles of ice. that was slowly", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/ernest-shackleton-enduring-the-impossible", "title": "Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible", "chunk_index": 8, "publication_date": "2024-04-22", "total_chunks_in_doc": 33}}

Okay, so if you can imagine that, the Weddell Sea, like I said, pretty calm, but the water tends to just circulate in a clockwise motion. So they start, uh, like at three o'clock on the eastern side, and then they're just being rotated around this sea, this giant bay. So they're being rotated, they're kind of spinning in a circle, and they're just waiting to see Where they will end up when spring comes. Uh, and then, you know, they're hoping they'll be able to break out and might be able to make a go at the continent or whether they might just have to, you know, sail home you know, the other thing besides like absolute survival, physical survival. Is that they have to worry about and that other ships really struggled with is mental survival, keeping your wits about you. , they were just beginning the polar winter. where they'd have to endure months of complete darkness. As Lansing says, quote, In all the world, there is no desolation more complete than the polar night. It is a return to the Ice Age. No warmth, no life, no movement. Only those who have experienced it can fully appreciate what it means to be without the sun day after day and week after week. Few men unaccustomed to it can fight off its effects altogether. And it has driven some men mad. And there are plenty of accounts of boats that have ended up just like the Endurance, and the men are driven either suicidal or homicidal at each other's throats. Uh, you know, they get depressed, lethargic. It's not hard to understand why when you hear those conditions. But, There's very little depression on board the Endurance, and it's worth analyzing why. One thing is Shackleton's policy of hiring on, you know, vibes only. As I said, if you recall, he interviews people for less than five minutes, and he's really just trying to get to know them. And so, all these guys kind of get along. , and so, you know, they, they kind of goof off and, uh, they're able to have a lot of fun.

It says in the Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible: next night, Wuzzles Worsley, that's his nickname, was put on trial for quote, robbing a Presbyterian church of a trouser button out of the offertory bag, and having turned the same to base and ignoble use. The proceedings were long and disorderly. Wilde was the judge, James the prosecuting attorney, and Ord Lee's the defense attorney. Greenstreet and McIlroy gave testimony against the defendant, but when Worsley promised to buy the judge a drink after the trial, Wilde charged the jury to find the defendant innocent. Nevertheless, Worsley was found guilty on the first ballot. Okay, so they're putting on this big mock trial for this very funny, fake crime of stealing a button from a church. They also had competitive sled races with men taking and placing bets on every race. So, you know, they got all these sled dogs, they have these sleds, and so they form these little teams. And the teams, you know, they form rivalries and they have people betting on it And winning and losing a little amounts of money, but also, you know, cigarettes and tobacco and stuff like that. There were regular social occasions. Every Saturday night, the men were issued a little bit of alcohol and it was drunk invariably with a toast quote to our sweethearts and wives, to which a chorus responded, may they never meet. During the month of June, the average reading was negative 17 degrees outside. That's Fahrenheit. Those are freedom measurements. Okay, so it is cold, so you think, like, how do you even survive in those conditions? And yet, the men did bundle up and take trips outside, enjoy breathtaking views when the full moon provided enough light to see their surroundings. Okay, so they're finding ways to occupy their time, , and mentally they're actually doing okay, despite, you know, this horrible Antarctic winter. But in August, as the southern spring started to hit, this relative comfort started to turn into uneasiness. The ice was breaking up, and with it, their sense of security. The frozen flow that had held them in place had kept them, you know, prisoners where they were, yes, but it also kept them safe. You know, nothing was changing, they were just embedded in this million square mile ice flow. Now, a giant crack appeared, and the flow started to separate. The new pieces of the flow battered the side of the ship from time to time, causing it to shudder and tilt.

The new pieces of the flow battered the side of the ship from time to time , causing it to shudder and tilt . So Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible: you can imagine just like You know, think of the size of these ice floes. They are miles across, okay? So they're thousands of tons, maybe millions of tons of weight, and they're just smashing this ship against each other. And then finally, the pressure was so immense that it pushed the ship out of the water and it suddenly listed to the side. For the next few days, it was stuck there, tilted 30 degrees. Okay, so that's like a pretty steep incline. The men had to eat in this weird manner. If you can imagine, like, look at the room you're in. Now imagine it tilted 30 degrees to the side. So they actually had to eat kind of like in the corner of the room with their butts on the wall and their feet on the floor. If that makes sense. You know, at first, through all this battering, the endurance holds up well. It was an extremely well built ship. As one of Shackleton's top lieutenants put it, quote, She seemed to say to the grinding, hungry pack, You may smash me, but I'm damned if I'll go over another inch for you. I'll see you melting in hell first. But even an excellently built ship can't stand up to the awesome power of nature forever. On October 24th, the men heard and saw a giant pressure coming. The whole earth seemed to be in movement. One of the men wrote, The whole sensation was of something colossal, of something in nature too big to grasp. I mean, just imagine that, right? Like, through the winter, you have been on this ice flow, And it seems solid and stable. And now all of a sudden you have this wave of pressure come through and the whole ground turns to liquid, right? It's just everything is kind of upended. Uh, the ice pushed, crushed, and tore at the ship until finally a gash was made across the front of the endurance and water came pouring in. It didn't immediately sink, and Shackleton sent his men pumping the water out and making repairs, but it seemed that the end was soon coming for the Endurance. Largesthe ordered the lifeboats and as many supplies as possible offloaded to the largest of the surrounding ice flows. Tents were set up, and a camp was made there on the ice.

{"text": "lifeboats and as many supplies as possible offloaded to the largest of the surrounding ice flows . Tents were set up , and a camp was made there on the ice . The next day , the situation worsened . The Endurance was crushed further . Shackleton wrote at the Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible: time, quote, 'The twisting, grinding flows were working their will at last on the ship. It was a sickening sensation to feel the decks breaking up under one's feet. The great beams bending and then snapping with a noise like heavy gunfire. Finally, Shackleton could see, you know, this is not going to go the other direction. Uh, it's over. And so he gave the word to the final stragglers. Who had, sometimes been hanging out on the ship. He says, she's going boys. I think it's time to get off. , a group of about eight to 10 Emperor penguins came and observed the destruction of the ship with these weird mournful cries. And already in this dire situation, some of the men took this as a bad omen. Do you hear that? One of them said. We'll none of us get back to our homes again. That first night on the ice, Shackleton couldn't sleep. He paced around the camp continually. Around 1am, he felt a jolt. He looked down to see a thin crack of ice in the middle of the camp. As the seconds passed, it quickly widened. Shackleton ran from tent to tent, waking men and telling them to move to the larger of the ice flows as quickly as possible. This was caused for panic. If the men ended up on separate ice flows, it'd be very difficult to get between the flows and they might be permanently separated. So Shackleton ran from tent to tent, waking men and telling them to move as quickly as possible. So they gathered their stuff and throw it to the larger of the ice flows that was created by this new division. Finally, safe on their new ice floe, with all their men together in a new camp, and with all their equipment, the men dozed off to sleep under the watchful eye of Shackleton. So you can see from this first night, conditions were very precarious out on the ice floes. They had a camp, they had tents, But they no longer had the feeling of safety that they had while they were on board the Endurance.

They would march across the ice flows toward Paulette Island, which was 350 miles away where Shackleton knew a team had stashed a cache of supplies. Now, they weren't going to be able to walk the entire way. They couldn't just stay on the ice low until they got to land. They were going to have to, sail eventually. So they were going to drag two of the three lifeboats with them, knowing that they would eventually encounter open water. This was a desperate plan with the barest hope of success. And yet, once again, there was a notable lack of discouragement. The men were glad to have a plan and something to do. Shackleton wrote, quote, The task was likely to be long and strenuous, and an ordered mind and a clear program were essential if we were to come through without loss of life. A man must shape himself to a new mark directly after the old one goes to ground. And I like that.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/ernest-shackleton-enduring-the-impossible", "title": "Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible", "chunk_index": 13, "publication_date": "2024-04-22", "total_chunks_in_doc": 33}}
{"text": "to be long and strenuous , and an ordered mind and a clear program were essential if we were to come through without loss of life . A man must shape himself to a new mark directly after the old one goes to ground . And I like that . Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible: That's a great lesson. If one plan fails, you need a new one as soon as possible. Having a really clear plan is an antidote to panic, to depression, to low morale. I mean, one of the things I think of is if you go back and listen to that episode on the Caesar guide to taking over the world, Caesar has few troops and lacks the backing of the Senate, but his opponent Pompey has no plan. And Caesar does have a very clear plan. And so he wipes the floor with them. People deal really poorly with uncertainty and they are just super charged by the feeling that there's a plan and they just need to execute. It simplifies everything. And even when that plan is maybe not optimal, uh, it's way better than no plan. So the first thing they have to do is Shackleton decides that if they are going to survive, they need to travel light. And so he calls everyone together and makes a dramatic gesture. Here's how Lansing describes it. Quote, In the afternoon, Shackleton called all hands together into the center of the circle of tents. He explained it was imperative that all weight be reduced to the barest minimum. Each man, he said, would be allowed the clothes on his back, plus two pairs of mittens, six pairs of socks, two pairs of boots, a sleeping bag, a pound of tobacco, and two pounds of personal gear. Speaking with the utmost conviction, Shackleton pointed out that no article was of any value when weighed against their ultimate survival. And he exhorted them to be ruthless in rooting themselves of every unnecessary ounce, regardless of its value. After he had spoken, he reached under his parka and took out a gold cigarette case and several gold sovereigns and threw them into the snow at his feet. Then he opened the Bible Queen Alexandra had given them, and then he laid the Bible in the snow and walked away. It was a dramatic gesture, but that was the way Shackleton wanted it. From studying the outcome of past expeditions, he believed that those that burdened themselves with equipment to meet every contingency had fared much worse than those that had sacrificed total preparedness for speed. So I think there are two lessons to be learned here. The first is to sacrifice total preparedness for speed. It reminds me of the Jeff Bezos quote, Quote, most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70 percent of the information you wish you had. If you wait for 90%, in most cases,", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/ernest-shackleton-enduring-the-impossible", "title": "Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible", "chunk_index": 14, "publication_date": "2024-04-22", "total_chunks_in_doc": 33}}
{"text": "first is to sacrifice total preparedness for speed . It reminds me of the Jeff Bezos quote , Quote , most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70 percent of the information you wish you had . If you wait for 90 % , in most cases , Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible: you're probably being too slow. So again, that is someone who is sacrificing total preparedness for speed. The other takeaway is what I call selective irrationality. You have to have your core principles, and you have to stick to them as a leader. Even when it's a little irrational. So an example of this, look at Costco, they could bump up their margins on a few carefully selected products and make a boatload of money whenever they want. But then where do you stop compromising? It's the job of the leader to say, no, you know, we're going to take, I think Costco marks up everything at about 15 percent above cost. And so, you know, that's the job of the CEO of, of the founder of the leader to say, you know, we're, we're going to abide by our core principles all the time, even though rationally we could cheat a little bit and, uh, and, and make some profits. Um, there's a famous story of their founder, Jim Senegal, telling Costco's CEO, um, he asked if they could raise the price of the hot dog, uh, which has been a dollar 50 for a hot dog and a soda since 1984. And one of my favorite quotes ever, Jim says to the CEO, if you raise the effing hotdog, I will kill you figure it out. So look in the grand scheme of things, how much is a gold lighter going to weigh you down? Not at all. Right? That's why it's selective irrationality. It's irrational. It's worth a lot. It weighs almost nothing, but you have to be the moral compass as a leader. You have to be the one who is selectively irrational by sticking to your principles. Even when the rational thing is to cheat a little bit. So Shackleton gives up the lighter and the coins and the Bible. Now, in this case, despite the sacrifices made, the plan is suboptimal. I mean, there's no great plan, right? The boats are really heavy and the ice flows are too uneven. On the ice flows, you have all of these ridges from where ice flows have crashed together and created, you know, this little bump. So it's a nightmare to try to move all of their stuff. Because you have to clear the way for all these boats and these sleds. So they're doing less than a mile", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/ernest-shackleton-enduring-the-impossible", "title": "Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible", "chunk_index": 15, "publication_date": "2024-04-22", "total_chunks_in_doc": 33}}

So they ' re doing less than a mile Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible: per day, and the terrain is getting worse and worse. And so they're only going for a few days and have covered less than 10 miles when they decide to stop and set up a new camp. Shackleton calls their new campsite Patience Camp. They send out small expeditions back to the Endurance, which is kind of floating in tatters, to recover more provisions. And they also regularly hunt seals and penguins to keep restocking their food supplies. They also, in probably the saddest chapter of this entire ordeal, kill all of their sled dogs. Because Shackleton is coming to the realization that they're not going to be able to hike out of here. They're going to have to travel by boat, where they're not going to be able to fit sled dogs. And in the meantime, these dogs aren't helping at all, and um, they use quite a bit of food. And so, uh, yeah. The dogs are, are all executed. Some of the men were absolutely sick about it. I mean, it's horrible. It's horrible to read about. But of course, Shackleton can't let them just sit there dwelling on the negatives, that this plan is quickly failing. They have to come up with a new plan. And so they go, they recover the third lifeboat, and now the new plan is to camp out on the ice, and wait until it, A, carries them closer to land, and B, the ice flow starts to break up so that it will be easier to launch the boats and sail out rather than trying to walk out. So after a little bit of, uh, kind of depression and moping, the mood in the camp is once again cheery now that they have a plan again. And so they hunt, they talk, they play cards, they debate. Conditions are horrible, but they have a plan and everyone knows what to do. You know, Shackleton is extremely attentive to the morale of the party. Remember, as Napoleon put it, in war, the moral is to the physical as three to one. Or in other words, morale is three times as important as physical conditions. So Shackleton is obsessed about how to keep the men in good spirits. Another thing he did, , in order to accomplish this is to keep any troublemakers or depressive types close to himself. So he thinks, you know, I'm a hearty personality. I don't break easily. So I'd rather take", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/ernest-shackleton-enduring-the-impossible", "title": "Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible", "chunk_index": 16, "publication_date": "2024-04-22", "total_chunks_in_doc": 33}}
{"text": "Another thing he did , , in order to accomplish this is to keep any troublemakers or depressive types close to himself . So he thinks , you know , I ' m a hearty personality . I don ' t break easily . So I ' d rather take Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible: the brunt. of the bad attitudes and the bad actors than pushing it on other people and, you know, potentially souring the entire mood of the party. As Lansing puts it, quote, As a consequence, he was intensely watchful for potential troublemakers who might nibble away at the unity of the group. Shackleton felt that if dissension arose the party as a whole might not put forth the added ounce of energy which could mean, at a time of crisis, the difference between survival and defeat. Thus, he was prepared to go to almost any length to keep the party close knit and under his control. Another thing Shackleton does is share his men's conditions. He was a force of nature. He was famous. He was Sir Ernest Shackleton. He was literally a knight. No one could mistake him for just another one of the men. They all called him boss. They all kind of reverenced him, but he made sure that even though he might have been socially and emotionally a little bit distant, he was physically very close. Again from Lansing, he says, he wanted to appear familiar with the men. He even worked at it, insisting on having exactly the same treatment, food, and clothing. He went out of his way to demonstrate his willingness to do the menial chores, such as taking his turn as Peggy to get the mealtime pot of hoosh from the galley to his tent. And he occasionally became furious when he discovered that the cook had given him preferential treatment because he was the boss. I think there's something really beautiful in that scene of his men trying to cheat to give him better treatment and him insisting that he share their exact conditions. And by the way, this is, again, , another tactic used by, probably most famously Julius Caesar, was really a general of the people, and George Washington, uh, was the same. Those are two great examples, and it really endears you to people that you're trying to lead. They are in Patience Camp for over three months, just waiting and watching. I mean, not just waiting and watching. They prepare the boats, they ready their supplies, they get everything ready, but there's not a whole lot they can do. Until, finally, in March, They feel some ocean swells, which starts to create cracks and breaks in the giant ice pack that they're floating in. But they have this problem on their hands.

The breakup of the ice , which is going to allow them to escape via these Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible: boats, presents its own dangers. Because it means that the ice flow that they are camping on keeps cracking and splitting. So, like, they need it to crack and split, but that is very dangerous. And, uh, Shackleton, of course, was deathly afraid of the party being split up. He thought if he got separated from part of the group, those men were as good as dead. And a number of times, the night watch calls out during the night that a crack has formed, and he's dead. in the middle of the camp and men have to rush their tents and equipment onto the other side of the crack before the ice flow splits and separates them. Also with this breakup, there are now all these, you know, crevices that are hard to get over. So it's making it harder to move around and hunt. And they begin to run low on food. So rations are shortened and the men are constantly hungry. The ice flow splits and splits again and again and again until the ice flow that had started about a mile across is now no more than 200 yards. And then one night, Shackleton once again had one of his bad feelings and can't sleep. And so he's up and pacing around at 11 p. m. when he hears a massive thud. and looks down to see the ice floe splitting right under his feet, and right under the tent that he was sharing with eight other men. It quickly widens to a crack of a few feet. Shackleton cries out, and most of the men scramble out of the tent, but one goes splashing into the newly created crevice. Shackleton rushes forward, clears the tent, and sees a man wriggling in the water, trapped and weighed down by his sleeping bag. Shackleton reaches down, and with one tremendous heave, throws the man out of the water just before, the ice comes crashing back together. Had Shackleton not grabbed him, he would have been crushed by thousands of pounds of pressure and pulverized. Just to give you an idea of the conditions that they were in. Remember, he said, you only get to keep the clothes that you have plus six pairs of socks, two pairs of boots. And so this guy has. No extra pairs of clothes, neither does anyone else. And so for the rest of the night, he had to keep walking around the campsite to dry out a little and keep himself from freezing to death.

They thought , you know , even if he gets into Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible: his sleeping bag with these wet clothes, he's just gonna freeze and die. So for an entire night, this man gets no sleep and just has to walk in circles in order to survive. The next day, Shackleton decides that the ice pack was loose enough and it was time to launch the boats. Besides their ice flow is tiny now and it's constant breaking and dividing was now truly hazardous. You know, they had narrowly missed complete disaster and a dead crew member. And so, they, they couldn't do this anymore. It was time to launch the boats they were going to make for elephant Island. So this is a change in plans a little bit. The supply cache that they had wanted to go for was now impossible to get to because of where the current had taken them. So they're headed for this island, Elephant Island, is completely deserted, no one on it, but there at least they would have solid ground under their feet, they wouldn't have to worry about constantly shifting ice flows, and they could make it a base of operations for a rescue mission. So it seemed like a good next step. On April 9th, the boats were launched. The chances of actually making it to Elephant Island were very slim. were frankly not good, but it was their only chance. The journey in these three little lifeboats was pure hell. The already freezing air was made worse when freezing spray burst over them with every wave. Many of the men became seasick. I mean, just imagine, okay? So they're out of the Weddell Sea now. They're coming out of it. And so there are waves now and they're rocking them. So imagine being huddled in a boat. , with at least eight other men and you can just really confined. It's very crowded. It's negative 20 degrees Fahrenheit outside. That is negative 29 Celsius. For those of you who are not American and you're regularly getting soaked. By sea spray. So not only is it negative 20, but you are usually soaking wet. You're hungry. You don't have very much food and the food that you do have is often difficult to get to and not very good.

I mean, there are times when the wind and the currents are so bad that after Three days at sea. navigator checks their location, and they have been just rowing and sailing as hard as they can for three days, and they check the location, and they're 22 miles further from land than when they had started. So they had been working so hard, basically just to try and stay in place, and they hadn't even quite managed that. I like Lansing's description. here's a quote about after one particularly bad night of storms, when some of the boats almost sink. Uh, he says, quote, But the dawn did come at last, and in its light the strain of the long dark hours showed on every face. Cheeks were drained and white, eyes were bloodshot from the salt spray, and the fact that men had slept only once in the past four days. Matted beards had caught the snow and frozen into a mass of white. Shackleton searched their faces for an answer to the question that troubled him most. How much more could they take? There was no single answer. Some men looked on the point of breaking, while others showed an unmistakable determination to hold out. At least all of them had survived the night. And it's the little things that really get to you when you read about them. For example, the men have to keep wiggling their toes all the time. Their boots are full of water. You know, their boats are constantly flooding. And so their feet are like constantly submerged in water. And if they stop wiggling their toes, Then the pain stops. So there's this temptation to stop moving around their feet. , because, , , wiggling their feet keeps the blood flow going, but if they stop wiggling their feet, the pain goes away, it's all numbness, but what's happening is they are succumbing to frostbite. And, you know, when they get to elephant Island, their feet will have to be amputated. So you have all these men, in addition to worrying about, you know, bailing out the boat and rowing and, uh, and not going overboard and hunger and all this stuff. Just like this little thing of, I constantly have to wiggle my toes. And if I don't, I'm going to lose my feet.

And, uh, you're always getting splashed by waves as you're doing this. So, you know, another one of these, like, crazy facts is, uh, this water. You know, it's ocean water, so it can go a little bit below 32 degrees. So I think the temperature is, like, it's 30 or 31 degrees water. And, um, It actually didn't feel bad. It felt good, because it was below zero degrees outside. So sitting in 30 degree water actually felt warmer than just the air. So, I mean, just imagine being in such a horrible cold condition that sitting in your cold plunge. And by the way, 30, 31 degrees, that's colder than your cold plunge. So imagine that sitting in your cold plunge would warm you up. That's how cold it is. And then add on this, you know, Ice starts to form on the boats and it's weighing them down. And so they're like, Oh, we have to, we're going to sink. And so they have to get axes and start chipping off the ice from the sides of the boat. It's like unbelievably horrible conditions. They're kind of on the edge of life and death the entire time, especially at the end. They hadn't brought enough fresh water and ice to melt down and so the men start to get thirsty and so their tongues are swollen Their their lips are cracking There's a serious threat the most likely way they're going to die if they die on this journey is from thirst At least towards the end the other big danger besides dying of thirst.

Okay, so there's this, this band. And because there is no land to stop things, the water traveling west to east, uh, just keeps going and picking up momentum. So it's one of the strongest currents. in the entire world. So this water is just like a whirlpool effect. Water and wind is just going really fast from west to east. And so, , if you get caught in this area, it's also super stormy because of these conditions. And so, uh, it's called Drake's Passage, just below South America, and it's like the stormiest water And if you get caught there, you can't go back because of the current. Does that make sense? So if they overshoot Elephant Island, even by like, imagine they just barely sail past it. They're going to be caught in this current and they're taken east. Oh, you know, at a million miles an hour, there's no turning around. There's no getting back. So like they could miss the island by a few yards. And, and that's it. Like if they sail past it, there's no going back. And it's, it's not easy to hit this, you know, it's 1915. Uh, they have no GPS, no technology. Uh, they have manual navigation, so they've got a chronometer and, uh, they have manual tools to measure their position by the sun and by the stars. But it's all this stormy weather, you know, often they can't see the sun and the stars. So often they're kind of just having to estimate. where they are. , and so again, they keep worrying that they're going to wake up one day and see elephant Island behind them. And even if it's just a little bit behind them, that's it. That means they're dead. So they have one shot at this. If they overshoot it, that's the end.

And on April 14th , they wake up and they see elephant Island there in front of Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible: them. They breathe a sigh of relief to know that they haven't overshot it. They were only 10 miles away. So they wake up, we're 10 miles away. Awesome. We got it. But then a strong wind and current tried to pull them away. It took all their energy just to row, to keep in place and not lose ground for the day, shackled and tried to issue the men biscuits to give them energy for one last push. So he says, you know, use up all the food you got. Let's make it today. But. They're so thirsty, you know, they'd run out of water at this point, that they can't eat the biscuits. They don't have enough saliva to swallow. And so Shackleton, his idea is, we'll then give them raw seal meat, and let's chew on the raw seal meat, in order to swallow the blood, to get just enough moisture, in order to swallow the biscuits. So, like, unbelievable stuff. But try as they might. You know, in this last day, they're only 10 miles away and, uh, and they can't make it. And that night, as they're just off the coast, they face the biggest storm yet. And so they're just trying to keep their boats upright through the night. They can't see these huge waves are just sweeping over them. , they're, there's snow and rain that is getting in their boats. And at this point, the navigator, the guy who's really pointing them where to go. Worsley is his name. And at this point, you know, he's the navigator. They're really relying on him. He has not slept for six days. And so in the night in the middle of this huge storm, you know, he's at the front of the ship trying to steer it, and he just falls asleep, like just . He slept six days. He just passes out in the middle of the storm and some men in his ship trying to relieve him and tell him to get some rest, and they find. That he can't straighten his body.

And so, , he can't straighten up. Uh, his muscles have frozen him in place in the cold. And so the men in the ship have to gather around him and start rubbing his thighs and stomach to try and warm him up and loosen him up enough that he can actually stand up straight. And, uh, by the time that they warm him up enough that he can, he was already asleep again, but somehow. They make it through the night and in the morning, the wind dies down just before dawn and the sun rises over the horizon and they see that they are just a mile from Elephant Island. And so they pull in and put their feet on solid ground for the first time in 497 days. Okay, I can only imagine what that feeling must have been like, just, just to have, you know, there's nothing on elephant Island. There are no trees, no fruit, no supplies, but just to have solid land under your feet. And of course there are glaciers and snow on the Island. So there's fresh water as well. Uh, when they arrive, Lansing writes, many of the men have stumbled about aimlessly scuffling their feet in the pebbles or bending down to pick up a handful of rocks. Some even dropped full length to the ground to feel its sublime solidity beneath them. For a time, a few men simply sat down, shivering uncontrollably and mumbling gibberish to themselves. Just then, the sun came out. In its light, their faces showed dead white from exhaustion and frostbite, and from being continually soaked with water. The circles around their eyes were so deep, their eyes seemed to have sunk slightly into their heads. They readied some milk as quickly as they could, and each man's mug was filled. They drank it almost boiling hot, and its heat spread throughout their bodies, setting their nerves to tingling, as if their blood had suddenly been thawed and begun to flow again. And then they sleep for like basically an entire day. Elephant Island, you know, to anyone else, it's considered a truly amazing inhospitable place. It's just a rock. It's just a rock that happens to be near Antarctica. But in addition to a narrow strip of beach, Elephant Island did have a few things going for it.

One was it had a nearby glacier to provide plenty of ice that could be melted into drinking Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible: water. And then the other thing it provided was large populations of seals and penguins that could be easily hunted for meat. Though of course, there was this concern, no one knows when those seals and penguins will move on, they're migratory. So Elephant Island was a breath of fresh air, but they couldn't stay forever. And so Shackleton brought them a new plan. He and five others would take the strongest of the three lifeboats, and sail it to an island with a whaling outpost, 800 miles away. So this was South Georgia Island, that place that they had started from. And that was the last sight of civilization they had seen. So, from Elephant Island, Actually, South America was closer than South Georgia, but I told you about that, that area, that current that flows west to east. Okay. So if they try and just go straight north to South America, they're going to get blown off course by that current. So they can't make it. And so even though South Georgia is hundreds of miles further than South America, it's going to be easier to try and ride this thing all the way to South Georgia Island. So they spend a couple days, they soup up this one boat a little bit, you know, they add more supplies, more support, more of everything. And so only ten days after they had arrived, Shackleton and his five boatmates set off on yet another treacherous journey. Once again, the conditions were horrible. Once again, they only had one shot, the same phenomenon. If they overshoot South Georgia, there's no turning around and sailing back to it. I won't go too much into the conditions of this voyage, Let's just say that they were, like the boat voyage to Elephant Island, only longer and worse. You know, the seas were worse, the waves were sometimes 50 feet high, their sleeping bags begin to rot and fill up with foul smelling green sludge, so they can't get comfortable in their sleeping bags when they're not on duty. Lansing paints a good picture of this boat midway through their journey saying, Here was a patched and battered 22 foot boat, daring to sail alone across the world's most tempestuous sea, her rigging festooned with a threadbare collection of clothing and half rotten sleeping bags. Her crew consisted of six men whose faces were black with caked soot and half hidden by matted beards, whose bodies were dead white from constant soaking in salt", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/ernest-shackleton-enduring-the-impossible", "title": "Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible", "chunk_index": 25, "publication_date": "2024-04-22", "total_chunks_in_doc": 33}}

Her crew consisted of six men whose faces were black with caked soot and half hidden by matted beards , whose bodies were dead white from constant soaking in salt Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible: water. In addition, their faces and particularly their fingers were marked with ugly round patches of missing skin where Frostbites had eaten into their flesh. Their legs from the knees down were chafed and raw, and all of them were afflicted with salt water boils on their wrists, ankles, and buttocks. On May 8th, after two weeks at sea, South Georgia was sighted. So, they're going through these 50 foot waves, and it's just crazy. But two weeks into their journey, They see the island and so once again they get this this false hope but nature still had more tricks up her sleeve. First they encounter hurricane force winds going the opposite direction which is not normal, right? You basically always get winds from west east but right when they're almost at the island they get these hurricane force winds going the opposite direction. But they get through this, this hurricane, and, um, they're finally closer than ever, they're only a few hundred yards, and they're almost on top of the island when they notice a reef that threatened to tear open the ship at the last minute. You know, they're just a few hundred yards from their destination, but they can't swim it. It's too cold. Their situation is too desperate. And so suddenly like they're almost on top of the island and now they're rowing as fast as they could away from it as the tide brings them closer and closer to this reef that threatens to just tear up their boat so close to their destination the navigator Worsley said that he thought quote not so much of dying because that was so plainly inevitable, but of the fact that no one would ever know. How terribly close we had come. Can you imagine that feeling? Like, oh, we're dead. And I'm not thinking about death. I'm just thinking, man, no one's ever going to know that we basically made it. We were only a couple hundred yards away. So I'll read now from Endurance by Lansing of what happens. Uh, it says, quote, He waited at the helm, silent and tense, braced for the final shattering impact when the boat's bottom would be torn out against some unseen rock. As he watched, the water streaming down his face and dripping from his beard, the sky to the east crept into view. She's clearing it, he screamed. She's clearing it.

She ' s clearing it . Miraculously , you Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible: know, they can't back up enough away to get away from this reef, but somehow the water just carries them over it in a wave and into this uninhabited Bay on the south side of South Georgia Island. When Shackleton and his boatmates arrive, they find a dribbling little stream running down from a glacier, and they just fall on their knees and start drinking. They set up camp and fell into a long, uninterrupted sleep. They were now so close to their goal. You know, they're on the island, there, there's a whaling station on this island and yet they are still deceptively far from it. Their boat was in no condition to make it back out of the bay and around the island. So they can't sail, you know, to the station. They're on the island, but they're on the wrong side of it and they can't sail around it. And even though South Georgia is small, it has peaks that rise to over 10, 000 feet. And in the 75 years that whalers had been coming there, no one had ever crossed the island. It was basically impassable, especially for a weak, bedraggled, poorly supplied group of castaways. And yet, Shackleton realizes there is no other path, they're going to have to climb it. And so Shackleton lays out his plan to the other men. He would take the two strongest remaining members of the party and cross the island to fetch help. The interior would be even colder and less hospitable, and they couldn't carry the weight of camping equipment, so the men would have to hike as many days as it took until reaching help without stopping to sleep at night. So it's probably going to be two or three days. , that's fine. We're just going to march straight through, no sleeping. As Shackleton and his two companions set off, they immediately encountered a nearly vertical wall and they had to cut steps into it with an ax in order to be able to ascend it. And so that's what I want to emphasize here. This was not a hike. They had to actually climb and use mountaineering skills at times to manage this journey on the first night. So that they leave in the morning, they're climbing all day. They're going over these peaks. And on the first night, they get caught on a lower peak, and as the sun is setting, they're finding themselves at about 4, 500", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/ernest-shackleton-enduring-the-impossible", "title": "Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible", "chunk_index": 27, "publication_date": "2024-04-22", "total_chunks_in_doc": 33}}

So Shackleton realizes they're going to die if they don't get off the mountain, , it's too cold. Keep hiking at this altitude. So Lansing writes, there was no need to explain the situation. Speaking rapidly, Shackleton said simply that they faced a clear cut choice. If they stayed where they were, they would freeze, in an hour, maybe two, maybe more, but they had to get lower, and with all possible haste. So he suggested they slide. Worsley and Crean were stunned, that's his two companions, especially for such an insane solution to be coming from Shackleton. But he wasn't joking. He wasn't even smiling. He meant it. The men raised their objections, you know, the conditions were foggy. They couldn't see what was below like this is a huge risk if we just start sliding down this mountain. You know what? If there's a cliff or grava will just fall and Shackleton says, yeah. If there is, then we might die. But if we stay here and we try and hike out, we know we'll die. So eventually they're like, okay, they link up legs and arms wrapped around each other, like they were going to ride a toboggan. And so they kick off and it's the great world's greatest rollercoaster ride. They start sliding and sliding down, down, faster, faster and faster. And they start screaming. And, um, it says, you know, not entirely out of fear, but like they are afraid that they're probably going to die. But in a weird way, it's also fun at the same time. , and so they eventually levels out and they do survive and they get to the bottom and he says, quote, the three men picked themselves up, they were breathless and their hearts were beating wildly, but they found themselves laughing uncontrollably. What had been a terrifying prospect, possibly a hundred seconds before had turned into a breathtaking triumph. So they survived this, this slide and they continue hiking in these slightly warmer conditions. You know, at least warm enough to survive, but you know, it's still freezing. They're exhausted. They have now been hiking for a day and a night with no sleep.

And , um , you know , these two other guys , they say , come on , man , Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible: come on, Shackleton, we need a rest. Just, just a little bit, just let us sit down and rest. And so they found a little spot that was sheltered from the wind and they sat down and the two others immediately fell asleep. And Shackleton too found himself nodding a little. It felt really good to sit down after all this hiking. He'd been working for so long, you know, not just the hike, but the boat expedition before that. And then the boat expedition to elephant Island before that, like his nerves had just been strained for so long. , and so as Shackleton sat there and started to nod off, his body felt good. He felt comfortable. He felt warm. But just as Shackleton started to nod off, he jerked his head up. He realized something. They were dying. He had been on enough polar expeditions to know that this was how men froze to death. That spreading warmth was death creeping into his body. He woke up the other men and told them it was time to move. He lied and said that they had been asleep for 30 minutes to hopefully help them believe that they were a little more well rested than they actually were. They walked for the rest of the night, always heading vaguely in the direction of the whaling station, but without any accurate map by which to orient themselves. Finally, at 6. 30, as they're hiking, they wake up. Shackleton thought he heard something from over the hill. Was that a whistle? The men waited with bated breath. They knew that the whaling station blew a wake up whistle at 6. 30 a. m. If he had indeed heard it, then a second whistle would sound at 7 to announce the start of the workday. For a half hour, these three men counted down the minutes. And then, exactly at seven o'clock, they heard it. The unmistakable sound of the factory whistle. They quickly stood up and moved toward the sound. Their path led them into a canyon with a stream. Eventually, the canyon narrowed until they had to wade up to their knees in this water. They then heard a sound that chilled their blood. A faint roar. As they drew near, their worst fears were realized. It was a 25 foot waterfall. They were too close now to hike back out the canyon and try and find another way down. They didn't even know if there was another way down. The only way out was through. They had a rope", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/ernest-shackleton-enduring-the-impossible", "title": "Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible", "chunk_index": 29, "publication_date": "2024-04-22", "total_chunks_in_doc": 33}}

And one by one, they lowered themselves down until they finally jumped into the pool of freezing water down below them. They swam out of the pond and onto solid ground and looked up from there. It was only a mile or so to the whaling station. As they walked, they suddenly became concerned with their appearance. They finally realized, well, we're there, we're about to encounter civilization. And they started looking at each other and going, man, look at your hair, look at my beard. And they start, you know, combing and padding and trying to make themselves look slightly more presentable. When they got to the station, they were first spotted by a boy who frightened by the men's appearance, ran and got help. When some men came to see what the excitement was about, Shackleton asked them who the leader of the station was. He was told it was an old Norwegian sailor named Sorrel. That's good, Shackleton said. I know Sorrel well. Please take me to him. The men took him to a nondescript little house, where they knocked on the door. Sorrel opened the door to his cottage and stepped back in astonishment. At the men's monstrous appearance. Who the hell are you? He asked. Don't you know me? Came the reply. My name is Shackleton. According to some accounts, Sorrel turned away and wept. The men were given a chance to groom themselves and bathe. As months worth of soot and grime were scrubbed off, their faces went from black to white. Their hair, now more than shoulder length, was cut back to its normal length. Long flowing beards were trimmed back. Worsley accompanied one of the whaling ships to rescue the other three sailors on the south side of the island. Shackleton writes what happened next. Curiously enough, they did not recognize Worsley, who had left them a hairy, dirty ruffian and had returned his spruce and shaven self. They thought he was one of the whalers. When one of them asked why no member of the party had come round for the relief, Worsley said, 'What do you mean? 'We thought the boss or one of the others would have come round, they explained. 'What's the matter with you? said Worsley. Then it suddenly dawned on them that they were talking to the man who had been their close companion for a year and a half. Was held at the whaling station.

Their spokesman, speaking in Norse with sorrel translating, said that they had sailed the Antarctic seas for forty years. And that they wanted to shake the hands of the men who could bring an open 22 foot boat from Elephant Island through the Drake Passage to South Georgia. Of the honors that followed, and there were many, possibly none ever exceeded that night of May 22, 1916, when, in a dingy warehouse shack on South Georgia, with the smell of rotting whale carcasses in the air, the whalermen of the Southern Ocean stepped forward one by one and silently shook their hands. Besides this little banquet, Shackleton took no time to celebrate or rest. 22 men were still waiting for him on Elephant Island. A number of rescues were attempted, but had to be abandoned because of the ice flows, which were still heavy around Elephant Island. It had been three and a half months since Shackleton and his five companions had sailed for South Georgia. And most of the men were starting to come around to the idea that Shackleton was dead, and with him, any hope of rescue. And then, on the morning of August 3rd, as the morning fog lifted, there it was. A ship. It stopped a few hundred yards offshore, and a few men got onto it. Even from the shore, the men could make out the unmistakable figure of Ernest Shackleton. As the boat pulled near, Shackleton shouted out, Are you alright? All well, they replied. One of the men asked Shackleton to come ashore and see how they had upgraded the hut since he had left. But Shackleton had that singular focus which distinguished him, that purposefulness. Even at this moment, he wouldn't be distracted by anything that wasn't essential to the mission. His men weren't safe yet. No, he told them, hop on board. Let's go home. Well, they did go home, and that is the miracle of the story. That All 28 men made it home safe and alive. One of them had a heart attack on Elephant Island, uh, but lived through it, although weakened, obviously. And then, you know, I talked about the wiggling of the toes.

And so one of his feet had to be amputated . , but everyone survived and that is actually like very little damage to come away from such a perilous journey . So there ' s Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible: a lot to say About my takeaways from this story. I have rarely found myself so moved But I'll just rapidly say a few of my takeaways and save the rest for my follow up episode So the first thing travel light it's better to be nimble and move quickly rather than try to be prepared for everything Remember, morale matters more than material conditions. Focus on making sure that your team is properly motivated. To that end, have a plan. Nothing kills motivation like uncertainty. Remove all uncertainty. A simple, imperfect plan is far preferable to waiting for a perfect plan. As George Patton put it, a good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan executed at some indefinite time in the future. Stick to your most important principles, and hold your team to them, even if you have to be selectively irrational. Think of Shackleton ditching the golden lighter. Have that focus on your mission. Think of Shackleton refusing to see the hut. You know, that purposefulness, if it's not the core mission, we're not doing it. And then lastly, the beauty of just the human will to survive. One of the most beautiful stories I've ever read, one of the best books I've ever read. If you haven't read Endurance by Lansing, you are missing out on an absolute classic. And then I will finish with one last quote. It is remarkable that one of the greatest stories of all time has come to us from what is essentially a failed expedition. And yet few journeys have so inspired and motivated the human race. I think that is part of the beauty of an audacious plan. Even in failure, the result is spectacular. And on that note, I'll close with a quote from the architect, Daniel Burnham, that I think encapsulates that sentiment perfectly. He said, make no little plans. They have no magic to stir men's blood and probably will not themselves be realized. Make big plans, aim high in hope and work, remembering that a noble logical diagram once recorded will never die, but long after we are gone, will be a living thing asserting itself with ever growing insistency. Until next time, thank you for listening to how to take over the world. ‚Äç", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/ernest-shackleton-enduring-the-impossible", "title": "Ernest Shackleton: Enduring The Impossible", "chunk_index": 32, "publication_date": "2024-04-22", "total_chunks_in_doc": 33}}

By putting 500 men at work with teams, they succeeded in building the levee high enough to keep the water out. Had the river risen another 4 inches, both their house and their new shop would have been under 3 or 4 feet of water. The first automobile in Dayton had just made its appearance. Orville thought that maybe he and Wilbur should build an automobile of their own. But for Wilbur, the idea had no appeal. He could not imagine, he said, how any contrivance that made such a racket and had so many things constantly going wrong with it could ever have a future. His mind was elsewhere. Wilbur Wright standing to give his famous \"parrot speech.\" Wilbur was asked to speak at a dinner given in his honor at the Aero Club de la Sarthe for establishing new world flying records on Sept. 21. When asked to say a few words, Wilbur remarked, \"I know of only one bird, the parrot, that talks, and he can't fly very high.\" What would it have been like to live during this time? Create a narrative to romanticize the period -- the times were alive with invention, technical innovations, new ideas of every kind in US (Kodak box camera invented by George Eastman, electric sewing machine by Isaac Merritt Singer, first elevator by Otis Company); Dayton was a city in which \"inventing and making things were central to a way of life\" Impressive speed of progress .

Um, they'd flown in straight line circles, s-shaped courses in comms and in winds, and it was now a practical flyer. I mean, it could take you places. ‚Äç You know, they submit a proposal to the War Department and it is summarily rejected. ‚Äç No one knows why. Maybe they thought they were cranks. Maybe it was bureaucratic ineptitude. Or possibly, and I think this is likely, is at least somewhat related to reluctance after Langley's failure to have egg on their face again. ‚Äç Wilbur told Chanute, It has for years been our business practice to sell to those who wish to buy, instead of trying to force goods upon people who did not want them. If the American government has decided to spend no more money on flying machines till their practical use has been demonstrated in actual service abroad, We are sorry, but we cannot reasonably object. ‚Äç They are the judges. So then they write back to the British. And the British War Office responded at once and serious correspondence began. There was no time to waste. A new 1905 Flyer III was underway. The Flyer III would be the first practical airplane in history. ‚Äç The Flyer III's engine produces 25 horsepower. It was more sturdy.

More than anything else, the sensation is one of perfect peace, mingled with the excitement that strains every nerve to the utmost, if you can conceive of such a combination. ‚Äç Orville writes, quote, At a height of 100 feet, you could hardly, you could feel hardly any motion at all, except for the wind which strikes your face. If you did not take the precaution to fasten your hat before starting. You've probably lost it by this time. The operator moves a lever, the right wing rises, and the machine swings about to the left. ‚Äç You make a very short turn, yet you do not feel the sensation of being thrown from your seat. So often experienced in automobile and railway travel. You find yourself facing toward the point from which you started. ‚Äç In October 5th, 1905, Wilbur circled the pasture 29 times, landing only when his gas ran out. ‚Äç Now they're flying for over 30 minutes in a single flight. In 1905, Dayton Press finally awakens. ‚Äç W. C. Fouts, the druggist, was quoted saying, When I went out to Hoffman Prairie, I expected to see somebody's neck broken. What I did see was a machine weighing 900 pounds soar away like an eagle. I told a friend about it that night, and he acted as if he thought I had gone daft or joined the Liars Club. ‚Äç They make another request of Washington, and they are flatly turned down once again. ‚Äç Chanute concluded, these fellows are a bunch of asses. ‚Äç Things, uh, stalled out with the French, and um... So they were ready to discuss sale to the French government. To the English. I think you saw that with the English. So they were discussing sales to the French government. ‚Äç Wow. According to the agreement, the brothers were to receive 200, 000, 1 million francs, for one machine on the condition that they provided demonstration flights during which the machine fulfilled certain requirements in altitude, distance, and speed. ‚Äç In 1906, the French start to, is the year that they actually buy a Wright Flyer, the Wright Flyer 3, but there's some French manufacturers who are doing impressive work themselves.

They refused to fly for them, but um, they willingly provide photographs and eyewitness testimony of the plane in flight. ‚Äç On April 7th, 1906, the Scientific American, American, starts to change their tune on the Brothers. ‚Äç In France, in 1906, Alberto Santos Dumont, a Brazilian born Frenchman, um, made a public flight covering 726 feet. ‚Äç Chanute writes to Wilbur, I fancy this is now very nearly where you were in 1904. ‚Äç A Flinton company, a New York firm, offers them 500, 000 for the sales rights of their plane outside the U. S. and they can retain the American market. ‚Äç In February of 1907, Germany offered 500, 000 for 50 Wright Flyers, but they wanted to see it in flight first. ‚Äç Wilbur goes. May 18th, 1907. ‚Äç Um, he's met. In London, by Hart Berg, Hart Oberg, an American who recognized Wilbur the moment he stepped off the train. Quote, I have never seen a picture of him, or had him described to me in any way. And either I am Sherlock Holmes, or Wright has the peculiar glint of genius in his eye, which left no doubt in my mind as to who he was. ‚Äç So they go to France first. ‚Äç And it's a very complex sale. You know, you got different government interests and um, they want to see the plane as is their right before they buy it, but they don't want to give away any secrets. So you know, it's a little touchy. It's a very complex sale, but Wilbur shows himself to be, uh, very adroit in negotiations. ‚Äç Very direct and very unpretentious, with good effect. If anything, his lack of French, his lack of sophistication, seemed to work to his advantage. That Wilbur neither drank, or smoked, or showed the least interest in women remained, of course, a puzzlement to the French. ‚Äç They can speed things up with a 50, 000 bribe.

The tension kind of wanes in August as government officials depart for their customary vacations. And so on August 4th, they go to Berlin. ‚Äç The press was following Wilbur and Orville everywhere. ‚Äç French aviation enthusiasts had no doubt, however, that France was now clearly in the lead. ‚Äç They now had a number of pilots who flew in public, including the Voisin brothers, Voisin, Gabriel and Charles, who have their own aviation company. ‚Äç Just, even though they don't fly, just being in Europe creates such a stir that it kind of gets things going. So, on February 8th, 1908, their bid of 25, 000 for a Flyer was at last accepted by the War Department less than a month. Later on March 3rd, they signed an agreement with a French company to be known as LA with an understanding that public demonstrations of the flyer in France would follow by midsummer. ‚Äç So in 1908, they go down to Kitty Hawk in order to practice. They hadn't flown since 1905, and so they needed some practice. ‚Äç Bill Tate was tied up. With work of his own, John T. Daniels had transferred to the Mags Head life saving station, and Dan Tate had died. ‚Äç They modified the flyer so it could carry two people sitting side by side. ‚Äç More wind resistance, but they'd be able to see better. ‚Äç And soon the press shows up. ‚Äç The reporters don't, don't get too close. A rumor was started that they had shotguns. And would shoot any reporters that got too close to the machines. All these reporters are amazed to see these test flights, you know, zooming by. ‚Äç So Wilbur crashes. Still unfamiliar with the new control levers. He made a mistake with the rudder. Suddenly plunged to the ground. About a mile from camp. ‚Äç Uh, he didn't, you know, he was bruised. And I cut on his nose, but didn't break any bones.

There was an outdoor hose for bathing and a privy. ‚Äç Saturday, August 8th. The 8th day of the 8th month of the 8th year of the new century. Was as fine as could be hoped for. Not a cloud in the sky. A northwest breeze was a little gentler than Wilbur would have wished, but he was up to go. ‚Äç As people saw preparations being made, they started filling up the grandstand at the horse track, as if they were there for a race. ‚Äç On the day of the test, he doesn't wear any special jacket. No special helmet, just his normal gray suit. He goes about his business the way he usually does. He shows no nervousness. Berg says, quote, neither the impatience of waiting crowds, nor the sneers of rivals, nor the pressure of financial conditions. ‚Äç Not always easy. to hurry over any difficulty before he had done everything in his power to understand and overcome it. ‚Äç At 3 in the afternoon, he finally rolls it out, he checks the field, he fiddles with the aircraft. Finally, at 6. 30, with dusk settling, Will returned his cat backward, and to Berg, Bolle, and the others said quietly, Gentlemen, I'm going to fly. Ha ha ha ha, amazing. ‚Äç He took the seat on the left. Two men started the engine, each pulling down a blade on the two propellers. ‚Äç He asks a mechanic if a last minute adjustment had been made on the motor. The man said, yes, we made it. And then Wilbur sat silent for a moment, then slowly leaving his pilot's seat, he walked around the machine just to make sure with his own eyes that this particular adjustment had, without the slightest shadow of a doubt, been well and truly made. ‚Äç He does a perfect little circle. In all, he was in the air not quite two minutes and covered a distance of two miles. The crowd was ecstatic, cheering, shouting, hardly able to believe what they had seen.

One of the French pilots present, Paul Zenz, who had been waiting since morning, told a reporter, I would have waited ten times as long to have seen what I have seen today. ‚Äç We are children compared to the Wrights, said another pilot, Rene Gossnier, Gossni Gossnier?

Then, very calmly. His face beaming with a smile, he put his hands in his pockets and walked off whistling. That night, while the normally sleepy town of Le Mans celebrated, the hero retired early to his shed. ‚Äç The Paris Herald reported, Mr. Wilbur Wright makes his first flight, French experts amazed by its smoothness.

Le Matin writes, the mystery which seemed inextricable and inexplicable is now clear away. Wright flew with an ease in facilities such that one cannot doubt those enigmatic experiments that took place in America. ‚Äç No more than one can doubt that this man is capable of remaining an hour in the air. It is the most extraordinary vision of flying machine, of a flying machine that we have seen. ‚Äç What was important was not how long it was, it was only two minutes. But it was the impression that he could have stayed in the air indefinitely. All these other flights were like staying in air as long as they could. Right.

Um, Ernest Archdeacon, who had run on with so many negative comments while waiting in the grandstand, stepped forth at once to say he had been wrong. Quote, for a long time, for too long a time, the Wright brothers have been accused in Europe of bluff. They are today hallowed in France, and I feel an intense pleasure in counting myself among the first to make amends. ‚Äç For the flagrant injustice. ‚Äç On Monday, August 10th, when the demonstrations resumed, more than 2, 000 people came to watch, including a number of Americans this time. That evening, the light fading. This is on the Monday. Wilbur flew again, this time making two giant figure 8s in front of the crowd in the grandstand and landing exactly at his point of departure. A craft flying a figure 8 had never been seen in Europe before. Leon De La Grange, who is a French aviator, When he sees this figure eight says, well, we are beaten. ‚Äç Wilbur becomes a figure of intense interest to people call him a zealot in Le Figaro. Franz Reichel writes he and his brother made the conquest of the sky, their existence. They needed this ambition and profound, almost religious faith. In order to deliberately accept their exile to the country of the dunes, far away from all. Wilbur is phlegmatic, but only in appearance. ‚Äç He is driven by a will of iron, which animates him and drives him in his work. Without wanting to diminish the value of French aviators, Reichel wrote that while Wilbur Wright was flying, they were only beginning to flutter about. ‚Äç De La Grange writes, quote, Wilbur Wright is the best example of strength of character that I have ever seen. Although he also writes, Even if this man sometimes deigns to smile, one can say with certainty that he has never known the sweetness of tears. Has he a heart? Has he loved? Has he suffered? An enigma? ‚Äç A mystery? He is sure of himself, of his genius, and he kept his secret. He had the desire to participate today to prove to the world he had not lied. ‚Äç My favorite interaction actually is when Wilbur is awarded a gold medal from the French Aero Club.

Even the most convinced had become duped, doubtful. And I confess that, in 1901, I said to my brother, Orville, that men would not fly for fifty years. Two years later, we ourselves were making flights. This demonstration of my inability as a prophet gave me such a shock, that I have ever since distrusted myself and have refrained from all prediction, as my friends of the press especially well know. ‚Äç But it is not really necessary to look too far into the future. We see enough already to be certain that it will be magnificent. Only let us hurry and open the roads. Once again, I thank you with all my heart.

On August 25th, in Le Mans, a celebration banquet in Wilbur's honor took place at the Hotel de Dauphine. This time he was happy to join the festivities.

At last, at 6 o'clock, Orville climbed into his seat, the motor was started, and the big propellers were cutting the air at a frightful rate. When he called out, let her go, ‚Äç Phoenix makes a successful turn, and the crowd breaks into a frenzy of enthusiasm. The line circled overhead at about 35 feet, and heads away down the field again.

You didn‚Äôt fight Genghis Khan, GK happened to you. He was a natural disaster. It was 1220, the year of the dragon, when Genghis Khan entered a city. For his entire life, Genghis Khan spent his nights in a traditional Mongolian tent, a ger. He was so disgusted by agricultural civilization that he always declined to even enter conquered cities. But on this occasion, he wanted to make a point. The city was called Bukara, and it was a part of the Khwarizm empire. Genghis Khan had sent a trade cavan to the Khwarizm, packed to the gills with gold, spices, silks, and more. They had killed his merchants, and taken all the treasure for themselves. But Genghis Khan was the most powerful man in the world. Surely he though, no one would be stupid enough to so brazenly defy him. This must be some sort of mistake. So he subsequently sent a diplomatic envoy to assess the situation. And these people had had the audacity to murder his diplomat and mutilate the diplomat‚Äôs companions. The Kyzyl Kum, the Red Desert. Genghis Khan would be forced to march many thousands of miles around the desert through well traveled and well fortified trade routes. Only he hadn‚Äôt. Genghis Khan had appeared in Khwarizm territory like some sort of phantom. One minute he wasn‚Äôt there, and the next he was, surrounded by a massive army of not only Mongolian horse archers, but Chinese siege engineers. Genghis Khan had been deliberate, almost leisurely, about attacking Bukhara. He first ambled about the surrounding territory, attacking smaller towns and villages in a predictable pattern. Any skilled craftsmen who could help him in an upcoming siege would be conscripted into the army. Then some of the more robust peasants were taken as slaves. Then the town was put to the torch, sending the rest of the population fleeing toward the larger city of Bukhara. The city, now bursting at the seems with peasants from the surrounding countryside, would run out of supplies much faster than anticipated. And the refugees spread stories that horrified the city‚Äôs residents to despair. With the city on the brink of hysteria, Genghis Khan offered them two options: ‚ÄúSurrender and receive lenient treatment, or fight and be utterly destroyed.‚Äù Bukhara‚Äôs defenders thought that the local citizens would surely betray them and capitulate to the Mongols, so they decided to retreat from the city before it", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/genghis-khan", "title": "Genghis Khan (Part 2)", "chunk_index": 0, "publication_date": "2023-10-05", "total_chunks_in_doc": 14}}

Little did they know, it was already too late. Genghis Khan had anticipated this development, and shortly after the city gates were shut behind them, Mongol warriors poured out from the sides of the roads and slaughtered the 20k warriors who had fled. The citizens of Bukhara opened the gates to Genghis Khan, but the remaining soldiers, there were only 500 of them, occupied a fortified citadel in the heart of the city. And so now Genghis Khan, for the first time in his life, was entering a city. He was drawn to the mosque. At first he thought it must be a palace, since it was the most ornate and beautiful building in the city. He was soon informed of his error, and went to visit it. It was unlike anything he had ever seen before. But he was not awed. Rather, he thought it paled in comparison to his god, Tengri. How could a man-made building compete with the vastness, beauty, and power of the eternal blue sky? Bhukara was the most prominent center of Islamic learning in central Asia. And Genghis Khan was intent on teaching its scholars a lesson. First they were made to feed and care for his horses. And then he called them into the mosque and delivered a brief lecture. They could debate theology and proclaim their own righteousness before God as much as they wanted, but the situation seemed clear to him. You have committed great sins, he told them. ‚ÄúIf you had not committed such great sins, God would not have sent a punishment like me upon you.‚Äù In the coming days, he turned his attention toward the citadel which was still holding out. Genghis Khan turned the full weight of his empire on the fort. Slaves rushed forward to attack the citadel, their bodies helping to fill the moat and forming human bridges when they were inevitably killed. Military engineers from across the empire dug under the walls to weaken them, and turned out a menagerie of siege engines to destroy and overcome them. Ladders, battering rams, catapults and trebuchets, launching stones, burning liquid, and exploding devices. They had giant crossbows, and wheeled portable towers with retractable ladders. They even had crude early forms of mortars and cannons. For the few days that the citadel held out, its walls were a constant scene of fire and death.

For Mongol warriors, raiding was fun, and it was also a way to climb the ranks and improve your station in life. In the chaos of these raids and couterraids, capable warriors and leaders could vastly improve their reputation and standard of living. And by eliminating all of this violence, he‚Äôs essentially freezing the social order in place. Predictably, this upsets a lot of people, and so the six years of peace after Temujin becomes Genghis Khan are not peaceful for him personally. The largest threat comes from a shaman. Actually the most famous shaman in the Mongol world. He was called Kokochu or Teb Tengri. And Teb Tengri had been very helpful in Genghis Khan‚Äôs rise. He had always prophesied that god favored Genghis Khan and would make him ruler of the entire world. And in return, GK makes him wealthy and powerful. But as Teb Tengri gets more powerful, he becomes jealous of GK‚Äôs family, and begins to start conflicts with them. And initially, GK sides with Teb Tengri. He even has his own brother, Khasar, tied up and imprisoned because he clashes with Teb Tengri. But his mother Holun talks some sense into him. The Secret History of the Mongols tells us that she comes in, unties Khasar, and then takes off her shirt and says ‚ÄúHave you seen these? These are the breasts that you sucked.‚Äù And then she lectures him on the need to stay united with his brothers. Genghis Khan relents a little, he frees Khasar, but he goes back on it, and actually supports Teb Tengri in a land dispute with another one of his brothers. it is actually his wife Borte who finally turns him against Teb Tengri. She says essentially if this guy can do this to your brothers while you are living, what do you think he will do to your sons when you are dead? So he has Teb Tengri killed and replaces him with a more pliable and less ambitious shaman. Now during this period of peace the empire is still growing. He goes to siberia and is basically able to blackmail the reindeer herders there to join his empire. He goes to the Uyghurs who are closer to China and forms an alliance there", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/genghis-khan", "title": "Genghis Khan (Part 2)", "chunk_index": 4, "publication_date": "2023-10-05", "total_chunks_in_doc": 14}}

He goes to the Uyghurs who are closer to China and forms an alliance there Genghis Khan (Part 2): as well. But despite these additions, the men are just pained by their inability to come up in the world through martial prowess. Genghis Khan realizes that plots and insurrections are going to accompany him as long as he keeps the empire at peace. And so in 1209 he takes his first steps toward firing his war machine back up. It starts with an invasion of the western Xia, a kingdom on the edge of the Chinese world. Certainly more chinese and less steppe-y than the Uyghurs or Mongols, but not quite as settled or Chinese as some other kingdoms. Genghis Khan personally leads the invasion, which is at first successful. They then suffer a defeat. This creates a stalemate, and the thing that breaks the stalemate, is one of the most famous Mongol strategies. And that is the false retreat. The Mongols struggled against a well defended opponent. They preferred not to fight up close, so if you could just hunker down and put your shield up, they were going to have trouble getting to you. Well, the Mongols had a perfect strategy to remedy this. They would come charging up, fire some arrows until you got irritated and counterattacked, and then as soon as you did, they would run away in full terror like they were in a route. Like they were fleeing for their lives. They even recruited men who were particularly good actors to serve in key positions so that they would really sell that they were defeated and afraid. And the enemies always took the bait. So they would go chasing after the retreating Mongols, and then as soon as they were spread out and disorganized and on flat ground that was favorable to the Mongol horse archers, they would turn around and attack. And this tactic was devastating. This is one of the first times it is used by Genghis Khan and he routes the Xia army. He then besieges their capital, and at this point, they don‚Äôt have siege engineers, they don‚Äôt really know how to do this. So at first the siege isn‚Äôt going anywhere, they try to divert the Yellow River to flood the Xia capital, and at first this appears to be going well, but then the dam used to divert the river breaks, and the river floods the Mongol encampment instead. With the Xia army destroyed but the Mongols also in a precarious situation, a deal is reached. The Xia will provide tribute to the Mongols and submit to them, Genghis Khan takes a Xia princess as a wife, and the Mongols agree to remove their forces from the area.

The Xia will provide tribute to the Mongols and submit to them , Genghis Khan takes a Xia princess as a wife , and the Mongols agree to remove their forces from the area . For GK , Genghis Khan (Part 2): It was his first modest steps into the invasion of the civilized world. It provided opportunities for distinction for his men, it provided a massive influx of wealth into his empire, and it showed both that he could have success in such an invasion, but also that he needed to improve his ability to conduct sieges if he were to be successful in the future. ‚Äç 1211 Invasion of the Jin. Initially unsuccessful again. But then he starts to recruit Jin engineers. Starting with 500 of them. Gets kind of lucky to take Zhongdu as his army is suffering from famine and plague. Secures treaty, then they move capital, so he turns around and wipes them out. Never lose money. Don‚Äôt rush to a decisive engagement when time is on your side. ‚Äç Genghis Khan was then looking for new territory to invade when he received a gift from heaven. In 1210, he received a delegation from the Jin dynasty. If the Xia were semi-Chinese, the Jin definitely had a Chinese kingdom. They themselves were not Chinese, at least not originally, their origins were as steppe invaders, but the territory they had conquered was solidly in China. It included Manchuria and much of what is now northern and western China. And this delegation proclaimed to Genghis Khan that there was a new Golden Khan. A new leader of the Jin. And this diplomat asks him, Genghis Khan, to bow down and submit to this new emperor and provide tribute. Oops. Instead, Genghis Khan turns to the south, toward the Jin territory, spits, and then storms off. This is a declaration of war. And the Jin think he is crazy. Yes, he‚Äôs the king of the steppe, but as far as they‚Äôre concerned, he‚Äôs still just a steppe barbarian. They are true Chinese monarchs with a vast kingdom. After hearing of this response, they have no idea that they are overmatched. In fact, they think the situation is exactly the opposite of what it is. They say to him ‚ÄúOur empire is like the sea, yours is but a handful of sand. How can we fear you?‚Äù Well, they would soon find out. Technically speaking, you can see why the golden khan felt so confident. They had under their control more than 600,000 soldiers, an army eight times larger than that of Genghis Khan.

Well Genghis Khan first plays upon existing divisions and recruits some of the troops who had an ax to grind with their Jin overlords over to his side . Then he splits his army and quickly marches Genghis Khan (Part 2): through Jin territory, taking vital mountain passes and destroying Jin croplands. They defeat the Jin in a series of small battles. The Jin are much more numerous, but the Mongols are so much faster and more mobile that they can concentrate their forces and outnumber the Jin at any given point. The Jin were a fairly typical army of the time, which meant they had lots of infantry, lots of men who had to march. And they had long supply chains that would bring them food and other supplies. The Mongols on the other hand, were a very different army. Not only was it made of exclusively cavalry, but each man had three horses with him so that if one horse was tiring he could mount the next one and keep going. And each man was almost unbelievably self sufficient. He had warm clothes, a knife and hatchet for cutting, a lasso, a sewing kit for mending hs clothes, strips of dried meat, 10 pounds of dried milk paste, some additional dried curd. And every horse that they rode was a mare, so the horses could also provide milk. When really starved for food, Mongol warriors would even cut their horses and drink a little bit of blood. Now let‚Äôs say all of this food runs out, let‚Äôs say it is more than a month with no new supplies. Well then Mongol warriors, with their protein rich diets, could still go for a couple days without eating and be in fighting condition. The Jin infantry on the other hand, ate almost exclusively rice, and if they weren‚Äôt fed for a day or two, quickly became hungry, weak, and sick. Each Jin warrior is essentially a cog in a machine. And as long as that machine is working well, they‚Äôre formidable. But each Mongol warrior is essentially an attack helicopter. A world unto itself. Capable of independently moving, feeding himself, making decisions, taking prisoners. And so these attack helicopters get loose behind the great wall, in Jin territory, and they can start messing with the Jin military machine. That is how they defeat the Jin and that is how they would defeat basically all of their opponents who came from more settled civilizations. After these victories, there are more defections from the Jin forces. And so Genghis Khan decides, let‚Äôs get to the heart of the matter. Let‚Äôs strike at the Jin capital of Zhongdu, modern day Beijing. Well it turns out they had overreached.

{"text": "s get to the heart of the matter . Let ‚Äô s strike at the Jin capital of Zhongdu , modern day Beijing . Well it turns out they had overreached . Whenever the Mongols went down into settled civilization , they ended up getting ravaged by disease . And Genghis Khan (Part 2): also, the further they got away from rolling grasslands, the more difficult it was for them to keep their army supplied for long sieges. But luckily, the Jin have even more internal dissension and the golden khan is killed and replaced. He makes a deal with the new khan, that he will provide tribute to the Mongols and submit to them and they will leave. And they do. But subsequently the new khan decides to move the capital further south away from the Mongols, more than 300 miles to the south. And that‚Äôs obviously a move to create a buffer and protect themselves from further Mongol invasions. Well Genghis Khan is mad about this, like wait, I thought you had submitted, why are you preparing to fight me again? So he and the Mongols return and this time they completely wipe out Zhongdu. Jin forces would fight on for years but northern China was now largely conquered. And importantly, Genghis Khan was learning. He used this conquest to vastly beef up his engineering corps for future sieges. He had been lucky in his siege of Zhongdu that there were internal divisions that led to the golden khan‚Äôs death. He wouldn‚Äôt have to rely on such luck again. While departing from Zhongdu, he has his men destroy the agricultural villages, and trample and churn up the farmland so that it will turn back into grasslands that his horses can feed on if they have to return. That is an essential feature of Genghis Khan‚Äôs conquests, is a disdain for agricultural life. Mongol language made linguistic distinctions between people and animals. And they always used grammar and words associated with animals to talk about the peasants. Genghis Khan never spent a night in a building. He slept in a tent every day of his life. And that is how you have to understand a lot of his massacres. He saw it as the culling of cattle in order to make room for real life, pastoral life, a life actually worth living. The other hallmark of Mongol invasions that you see from this one is the exploitation of internal divisions. This would actually place a large role in their next invasion. They invade a western Khitai kingdom, often called the Qara Khitai, and they are able to do so because the rulers are Budhist and had been suppressing the local Muslim population. The buddhist rulers had forbidden their Muslim subjects from religious study, public worship, or even sounding the call to prayer. So the Mongols are able to exploit these divisions, attract many Muslim warriors and officials to their side, and easily defeat the Qara Khitai. ‚Äç Take the", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/genghis-khan", "title": "Genghis Khan (Part 2)", "chunk_index": 8, "publication_date": "2023-10-05", "total_chunks_in_doc": 14}}

Speed. Self-sufficiency. Simplicity in home life often leads to extremes and creativity in your professional life. ‚Äç By now there was a truly massive influx of wealth into the Mongolian empire. There are stories that so much valuable Chinese silk floods the Mongolian market that they are using it as rope and wrapping paper. But you know how human nature is. That doesn‚Äôt satisfy the Mongols, it creates even more demand for MORE wealth. So Genghis Khan, who at this point controls basically the entire eastern half of the silk road, turns his eye toward the western half. And he‚Äôs now 60 years old. He‚Äôs still got fire in the blood, but at this point in his life, if he can avoid a fight, he rather would. So he decides to start trading with the major central asian player that is between him and the middle east, and that is the Khwarezmid empire. And Khwarizm went from modern Afghanistan all the way to the black sea. These are the guys from the opening story, so I‚Äôll just briefly go over it again. He sends a trade delegation, they kill them and take all the goods. There is a good quote from the Persian chronicler Juvaini who writes ‚ÄúThe governor's attack not only wiped out a caravan, it laid waste a whole world.‚Äù He sends a diplomatic delegation and they attack them as well. So Genghis Khan takes this personally and attacks with multiple armies. He himself leads an army through the desert in order to attack them from behind. This is such a master stroke that the Kwarezmid empire completely collapses in less than a year. And by the way, there is this good quote, when Genghis Khan writes to the people he says ‚ÄúCommanders elders and commonality know that God has given me the Empire of the earth from the east to the west Whoever submits shall be spared, but those who resist, they shall be destroyed, with their wives, children, and dependents.‚Äù So from that first sentence, we can now see that Genghis Khan believed in a divine destiny to rule the entire world. You can see this in the nature of the letters he writes to new foes. Instead of talking as one ruler to another, he takes a condescending tone. Something along the lines of ‚ÄúHey, I see you haven‚Äôt submitted yet.

Let ‚Äô s correct that little oversight . ‚Äù The destruction of the Khwarizm is the most complete of any of his Genghis Khan (Part 2): conquests. I mean complete and total annihilation. And there are some who argue that it basically sent the region into a talespin from which it has never recovered. Basically they argue that the reason Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan and those countries are still poor is because Genghis Khan laid waste to them so completely. And I don‚Äôt believe that, they still would have suffered greatly when the silk road was replaced by sea routes in the 1400s. But it tells you something about the level of destruction that this is still considered a valid hypothesis. I should also point out, that everyone had an incentive to lie. The Mongols shamelessly exaggerated their atrocities and the number of people they killed in order to terrorize others into surrendering. And people like the Khwarizm often inflated the death toll and destruction in order to ask for help from their Muslim brothers in the Middle East. They‚Äôre trying to drive home what a grave threat this man is. They write things like ‚ÄúThis is the greatest catastrophe and the most dire calamity which befell all men generally and Muslims in particular since God Almighty created Adam until now.‚Äù Now obviously, they are trying to play up the threat for dramatic effect. But at the same time, the things that are happening are real. In the city of Nishapur, an arrow kills Genghis Khan‚Äôs son in law. So he asks his daughter who is now a widow, what punishment she would like for the city that killed her husband. And she decrees death for all. Ao the Mongols take the city and kill everyone. They stack the heads of the men women and children in three separate piles. They even go through the city killing dogs and cats so that no living creature will survive. One plausible death toll puts the total number of people killed in central Asia from the Mongol invasion at 15M. That‚Äôs probably high, but whichever way you slice it, Genghis Khan‚Äôs military operation there was both impressive and terrifying and once again greatly enhanced the wealth of the Mongol Empire. ‚Äç Succession struggles. It is actually better to have a strong leader than a weak one. ‚Äç With the empire at an all-time pinnacle in terms of power prestige and wealth, Genghis Khan then turned toward the question of succession. He called a meeting of his sons to determine who would inherit the throne. The idea was to split up the kingdom and give them each a part, but to still have one son function as the Great Khan, the ruler of the entire realm.

HIs oldest two sons were at each other ‚Äô s throats over the succession Genghis Khan (Part 2): question. Jochi was the oldest and a very capable commander and leader, but as you might remember, his parentage was very questionable. He probably was actually not Genghis Khan‚Äôs son. His next oldest son was Chagati and he was also a very capable person. But the problem was that Joche and Chagatai were in such an intense conflict, that whichever one is made khan is immediately going to go to war with the other. At this meeting to determine the succession they have a physical fist fight so that tells you how intense the rivalry was. So GEnghis Khan makes a pretty smart decision, I think. First of all he gets mad at everyone who questions Joche‚Äôs parentage. He says you‚Äôre basically calling his mother a whore, and thereby calling your own mother a whore. ‚ÄúYou all sprang from a single hot womb. If you insult the mother who gave you your life from her heart, if you cause her love for you to freeze up, even if you apologize to her later, the damage is done.‚Äù I actually think that‚Äôs a touching bit of sentimentality from Genghis Khan and shows how much he loved his wife. But so he says ‚ÄúI accept Joche as my son, unquestionably. Buuuut I also kind of get it, so let‚Äôs compromise.‚Äù And so Chagatai and Joche are given territories that don‚Äôt border one another, and the third brother, Ogedai, is given the succession as great Khan. Ogedai was less ambitious, friendly, and a drunkard. And so he seemed like a pretty good choice. Everyone liked him and no one felt threatened by him. He also starts giving out his last pieces of advice. He‚Äôs old but still in good health but for a warrior now in his late 60s, he knows he won‚Äôt live forever. ‚ÄúWithout the vision of a goal, a man cannot manage his own life, much less the lives of others. It will be easy to forget your vision and purpose once you have fine clothes, fast horses, and beautiful women.

The campaign was proceeding , but slowly , and he thought his presence and veteran leadership could help Genghis Khan (Part 2): to speed things up. Well in the winter of 1226, he fell from his horse, injuring himself badly. He grew sick, and failed to improve. Finally in August of 1227, he died. For centuries, rumors have swirled about what actually killed him. Some said he was shot by an arrow during a siege, while others attested that he contracted malaria. However he died, he was quickly transported back to Mongolia where he was buried by his beloved Burkhan Kladun, the sacred mountain where he was born and to which he prayed and owed so much good fortune in his life. He had personally chosen his burial site previously. Rumors swirled about the fantastic fortunes that went to the grave with him. There were also fantastical rumors about a burial guard of 500 people who were killed by guards because they knew his burial site, and then those guards were killed because they knew where the burial guards had come from. Whatever the truth, his burial site is known to be somewhere around Burkhan Kaldun but was a secret and the exact location has eluded adventurers and researchers over the centuries. In part because the Mongolians themselves continue to revere the sanctity of the site and do everything they can to protect the site and stop others from finding it. ‚Äç Burial. What does your life mean? ‚Äç So let‚Äôs talk about the life and legacy of Genghis Khan. He was an incredibly destructive leader, but also a creative one. He opened up trade routes, established freedom of religion and worship over a large swathe of eurasia, swept aside exorbitant taxes that slowed trade, increased communication and helped spread technology. This is actually the time when gunpowder and other crucial technologies made their way from China into Europe and kicked off a mini renaissance. That renaissance was put on hold when the black death struck, but it kicked off again almost immediately thereafter in the 1400s. So the conquests of Genghis Khan had quite big knock-on effects. What can we learn from Genghis Khan? The first thing I want to point out is that he was quite religious, quite devout. Hollywood trend of always showing people in the past as cynical, whether game of thrones or Vikings or whatever. But these people were genuinely religious. Caesar was a chief priest of Rome before embarking on his political career, Alexander was scrupulous in his observations of sacrifices and prayers, I would actually say that Steve Jobs represented peak boomer spirituality, he wasn‚Äôt a religious guy in an organized sense but he actually did a lot to popularize this sort of techno Zen Buddhism that is honestly kind of the default.

It Genghis Khan (Part 2): didn‚Äôt used to be normal for people to meditate and do yoga. Anyway I think part of the reason for this is because they believe in something bigger than themselves, they can believe in a sense of destiny. And Genghis Khan really emphasized that. One of the last things he said to his sons was ‚ÄúWithout the vision of a goal, a man cannot manage his own life, much less the lives of others.‚Äù He believed that the all powerful god, Tengri, the vast blue sky, willed him to conquer the whole world and that the sacred mountain Burkhan Kaldun, empowered him to do so. And who am I to disagree? There is such power in having an ambitious vision. Okay there is actually so much more to talk about, this is going to be a pretty beefy endnotes episode. I‚Äôll talk about a few things like If Genghis Khan was a Mongol, why did he have red hair? What happened to his empire after his death? What have modern genetics taught us about Genghis Khan? We‚Äôre going to talk about the Mongol invasion of Europe, which I believe someone needs to make a horror movie about.

{"text": "you there . All right . So to start off with this episode , I just want to revisit . Some of the main takeaways from these three figures , George Washington , Alexander Hamilton and Benjamin Franklin . So I went through all of my notes and just drew The Secret of The American Revolution: out some of the things that I'm still thinking about that are rattling around in my brain. So with Washington, one of the big things is the physicality of greatness. So I have actually changed my life after reading about George Washington, which was I had this neck injury, , that was, , really kind of laid me up. And so I stopped lifting weights for a while and was doing other things to work out. And then after reading about Washington and thinking about that physicality of greatness, I thought to myself, no, I just need to figure out a way. That's the main thing I need to do. For my body to have more presence. And so I'm back in the gym lifting again as one of the big things. But as a reminder, George Washington, incredible physical presence, just a beast of a man, incredibly strong, tall, impressive. And that was one of the things that made him stand out that helped him accelerate his career so quickly. So early. Uh, another thing that I'm taking away from that first episode about George Washington is being a serious person, meaning what you say, projecting a sense of gravitas around your words and actions. So the one quote that leaps out to me from that is, uh, his advice that he gives to, I think it's his nephew, about being a legislator. He says, speak seldom, but to important subjects, except such as particularly relate to your constituents. And in the former case, make yourself perfectly master of the subject. Okay. So I love that idea of, Hey, don't talk about things that you don't know anything about. All right. Only talk about really important stuff or stuff that relates to your constituents, get in the practice of when you speak, having it be very meaningful and that habituates people to really paying attention to what you're When you speak, which means that you can have more impact when you do decide that something's important to you. So be physical and be serious. Uh, from the second part of Washington, the art of the dramatic gesture is something I'm thinking about. So there's a few good stories of that.

{"text": "is , uh , this , this , uh , Battle where the Americans are , one is this battle where , uh , uh , One is this battle where an advance guard of Americans are retreating and he pulls up on his horse and says , Parade with The Secret of The American Revolution: us, my brave fellows. There is but a handful of the enemy, and we will have them directly. According to his aide de camp, Colonel John Fitzgerald, Washington rallied the men with an uproar. Act of unbelievable bravery. He reined in his horse, faced the enemy directly and simply froze. Yet again, the intrepid Washington acted as if he were protected by an invisible aura. Okay. Um, so that dramatic gesture of, uh, yelling to his men. Kind of yelling to his men, rallying them, and then standing and freezing in the face of, of enemy fire. Uh, I've got two others, uh, one that I mentioned in the episode and one that I did not actually, it was the first time I'm talking about it. So one is, if you remember, there's this thing called the Newberg rebellion, all these officers who want to kind of rebel against the nascent U S government. And he's trying to calm them down and they're not really listening to him. And then he gets out a letter. And he can't read it and he pulls out his glasses and says, gentlemen, you will permit him and says, gentlemen, you will permit me to put on my spectacles for. I have not only grown gray, but almost blind in the service of my country. And that kind of melts the room, right? This is a great dramatic gesture. And then the other one is a dramatic gesture in a different way. It's to a friend and this is to Hamilton. So Alexander Hamilton is out of the Washington administration. They left on good terms and the Reynolds affair has just broken out. Right? Everyone knows now about this affair that Alexander Hamilton had with this woman. It's humiliating to him and to his wife. And Washington, you know, still has all of this great respect and admiration for Hamilton. Loves him. They're good friends. But there's not much he can do with him, right? Like, making a statement about it will only draw more focus and attention to this embarrassing affair. So what does Washington do for Hamilton? He sends him a very simple gift. He sends him a wine cooler and that wine cooler has a note that says, not for any intrinsic value, the thing possesses, but as a token of my sincere regard and friendship for you. And as a remembrance of me, I pray you to accept a wine cooler for four bottles.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/the-secret-of-the-american-revolution", "title": "The Secret of The American Revolution", "chunk_index": 2, "publication_date": "2024-07-04", "total_chunks_in_doc": 11}}

And as a remembrance of me , I pray you to accept a wine cooler for four bottles . The Secret of The American Revolution: I pray you to present my best wishes in which Mrs. Washington joins me to Mrs. Hamilton and the family, and that you would be persuaded that That with every sentiment of the highest regard, highest regard, I remain your sincere friend and affectionate, I remain your sincere friend and affectionate honorable servant, George Washington. Okay. It was such a simple gesture, just this little gift with a note that says, you know, I retain all my affection for you, but it meant so much to Hamilton and his wife. Eliza never sold the wine cooler, always treasured it That Washington of just this little token, this, of just this little token, this, this little like lifesaver that Washington threw to them in a very dramatic, difficult time in their lives. So I think that's another example of just that dramatic gesture of just, I always knew just to do the right thing that just demonstrated some little emotion that, that brought people in and drew them closer to him. So that's my big takeaway from part two of Washington. And then from part three, my big takeaway. Okay. Deliberate slowly, but act quickly after deciding. So Washington said deliberate maturely, but execute promptly and vigorously. Okay, so take all the time you need to make the correct decision, but once a decision is made, there should be no hesitation between decision and execution. Okay, moving on to Hamilton. From part one of Hamilton, there's of course the idea that writing is the way to break through. You know, this is someone who made his name with an article in the wake of a storm that had visited his island, and that is what got him on the radar of big important people. And then there's the idea of do more, write more, practice more, make more calls, do more deals. More generally wins. And, and with, and with that idea of more is the idea of wanting it more. And no one wanted it more than Hamilton. I mean, this is a guy, I mean, this is a guy who wanted glory, who wanted recognition more than almost anyone I've read about. Uh, I remember that letter that he wrote to his friend Ned. He says, quote, To confess my weakness, Ned, my ambition is so prevalent that I contempt the groveling and conditions of a clerk. Or the like to which my fortune, et cetera, condemned me. And would willingly risk my life, though not my character, to", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/the-secret-of-the-american-revolution", "title": "The Secret of The American Revolution", "chunk_index": 3, "publication_date": "2024-07-04", "total_chunks_in_doc": 11}}
{"text": "To confess my weakness , Ned , my ambition is so prevalent that I contempt the groveling and conditions of a clerk . Or the like to which my fortune , et cetera , condemned me . And would willingly risk my life , though not my character , to The Secret of The American Revolution: exalt my station. I'm confident, Ned, that my youth excludes me from any hopes of immediate preferment, nor do I desire it. But I mean to prepare the way for futurity. I'm no philosopher, you see, and may be justly said to build castles in the air. My folly makes me ashamed and beg you'll conceal it. Yet, Neddy, we have seen such schemes successful when the projector is constant. I shall conclude by saying I wish there was a war. So just that steady focus is like he said, such schemes are successful when the projector is constant. And he was so constant in wadding, And he was so constant in wanting that distinction so bad. So wanting it is something I take from Hamilton. From part two, one thing is his work style. Here's, Okay. Here's, here's a quote about his work style quote, one who knew his habits of study said of him that when he had a serious object to accomplish, his practice was to reflect on it previously. And when he had gone through the labor, he retired to sleep without regard to the hour of the night and having slept six or seven hours, he rose and having taken strong coffee, seated himself at his table where he would remain six, seven, or eight hours. And the product of his rapid pen required little correction for the press. Another thing I took away is the Hamilton method of learning. Do read, meet, and teach. So do the work, do the practice to actually get to know the craft, then read everything there is to read from the great authors, from the people who really know what they're talking about, then meet with people, whether peers or mentors who can teach you one on one about what you're trying to learn. And then prepare something to teach other people. So, you know, He had his law book and his Federalist Papers. He's always writing these treatises that worked as sort of a manual for how to do what he was learning. So, practice, read everything, meet with other people, and then put together something to teach others. And with those four steps, you can learn anything, like Hamilton learned so much. Moving on to Benjamin Franklin, my big takeaways. The first is this idea, be curious and playful, okay? Work doesn't have to feel like work. Some things you do just for fun will end up being very useful.

{"text": "much . Moving on to Benjamin Franklin , my big takeaways . The first is this idea , be curious and playful , okay ? Work doesn ' t have to feel like work . Some things you do just for fun will end up being very useful . In The Secret of The American Revolution: fact, I think probably the most useful things in your life are those things that you do for fun that eventually find a way through serendipity to have this big impact on your life and your career. So don't worry too much. about the usefulness of everything that you do. You have to at least have certain times when you give in to passion and excitement and playfulness. Make room for that in your life. The second idea, the second idea is kind of the flip side of Washington, which if the lesson from Washington is to be serious, then Franklin teaches us that there are different ways to get things done. Because a little bit of self awareness and ah shucks humility can go a long way, right? If you want to convince people, you don't always have to be so serious. You can use You don't always have to be so serious. You can use a diffident manner to ingratiate yourself to them and kind of bend them to seeing things the way that you do. So his good quote about this, he talked about his quote, habit of expressing myself in terms of modest diffidence, never using when I advanced anything that may possibly be disputed, the word certainly, undoubtedly, or any others that give the air of positiveness to an opinion. But rather say, I conceive or apprehend a thing to be so and so. It appears to me, or I should think it so and so, for such and such reasons. Or, I imagine it to be so, or it is so if I am not mistaken. Okay, so that idea of, okay, so that idea of when you couch things that way, you give people the flexibility to change their mind. Okay, because you don't make it a conflict, you make it kind of collaborative. When you phrase things that way. So I think that's a really smart way to approach convincing people of your point of view. Okay. So what are some similarities across all of these figures, Washington, Hamilton, Franklin? One is learn to communicate well, Hamilton and Franklin were extraordinary writers, Washington, not so much, but he was a great speaker. And he had that thing with dramatic gestures, which I view as a form of communication. But no matter what you do, learn to communicate well, learn to write well, learn to speak well. And that's something that was common across all of them. Another is equanimity.

All of them were able to keep a cool head when things The Secret of The American Revolution: were going wrong. Whether that is Washington going about commanding his troops while bullets are going through his hat and coat, or Franklin making the best of his situation in London, when the man who was supposed to be funding his venture turned out to be a fraud. And he's. In a foreign city with no money or Hamilton persevering through the relentless attacks on his character during his time in the Washington administration, all of them had this common trait of keeping that cool head of equanimity, and that's easier said than done, but you just have to practice learning to breathe and just keep a calm head and work through very difficult circumstances because they're going to come and great leaders are those who Who persevere and who see clearly despite difficult circumstances and see clearly despite difficult, despite difficult circumstances. And then the last thing that's kind of common to them is that they all kind of had a tribe and organized. They were great kind of social engineers. So Hamilton had his writing clubs. Franklin had his Junto. Washington had his core of junior officers. Americans in general have always excelled at self organization. I think it's one of the great attributes, which is what I think is one of our great attributes, which has led us to be so successful over the last 250 years. Okay. Self improvement is great, but mutual improvement is significantly more powerful. So the continental Congress, the constitutional convention, the Junto, the university of Pennsylvania, their various anti slavery organizations, Hamilton's role at Columbia university, Washington's Ohio corporation, like All of them had all of these self started organizations with which they collaborated with others and organized with others to accomplish things. So they all had a genius for organizing groups of people in a common cause. And I think that's crucial to their mutual success and explains kind of the success of the time. They also had major differences, of course. You can think of, as we mentioned, Washington's seriousness versus Franklin's playfulness, or Washington's reserve against Hamilton's verbosity, or Franklin's gently convincing against Hamilton's viciously attacking when it comes to their style of argumentation. So I think it goes to show that there are some things that you need. If you want to, , have the type of impact that they did, uh, on a, in a civic sense, but there are also different ways to do it.

You know, and I just think the, the broader point is that there are different ways to do it and you can learn different things from them, but you don't have to take the whole package. And if you're not exactly like any one of these three archetypes, that's okay. You can find a way to have your own impact. So I'm calling this episode The Secret of America's Revolution. , and what I mean by that is I've thought a lot about what was it? that allowed these people to be successful, to defy the greatest empire on the earth at the time, and form this constitution and this country that has lasted now for almost 250 years. None of these men It's one of the most remarkable accomplishments in human history. And, and what was it? What set them apart? What made this group of men unique that they could pull this off? And as I thought about it, , I thought that none of them could have done it alone. I mean, one of the things that really stood out to me, Was how different Franklin Hamilton and Washington were and not just them, right? I mean, those are the three that I profiled I think they're kind of the three most important But they were far from you know, the only founding fathers and it was this great whole cohort This is this generation which includes, you know, John Adams Thomas Jefferson Thomas Paine Samuel Adams Paul Revere John Hancock Benjamin Rush George Mason James Madison John Marshall John Jay You You can even go to the foreigners, Lafayette, Rochambeau, like all of these people came together to, to, to, all of these people came together in this great cause. So it was the association of these men that I think was the most crucial element. Their friendship, their mutual love and trust that led to the founding of this great country. I'd like to close with some words that were cut from the Declaration of Independence. Uh, it's probably for the best that they were cut because Jefferson's first draft was a little long. But at the same time. I find these to be some of the best sentiments in the document, and I can't help but regret that they were cut out.

Uh , so , I want to share them . The Secret of The American Revolution: The Declaration goes over the list of America's grievances, and then Jefferson writes, These facts have given the last stab to agonizing affection, and manly spirit bids us to renounce forever these unfeeling brethren. We must endeavor to forget our former love for them, and to hold them as we hold the rest of mankind. Enemies in war, in peace, friends. We might have been a free and great people together, but a communication of grandeur and of freedom, it seems, is below their dignity. Be it so, since they will have it. The road to glory and happiness is open to us, too. We will climb it in a separate state, and acquiesce in the necessity which pronounces our everlasting adieu. Okay. I love that the road to glory and happiness is open to us too. I love that sentiment of, you know, they're, they're just these small fledgling 13 colonies, but they're looking at great Britain and saying, you know, what, what you have that road to glory and happiness is magnificent empire that's open to us to anything is possible for us. And then the end of the declaration, which has changed very little in the final document. Here's what Jefferson writes. He goes through, you know, now we declare ourselves an independent nation. We sever all ties with Great Britain. And then this is the last sentence. This is how it ends. And for the support of this declaration, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor. I think it says so much that the document ends with this mutual pledge. I think it says so much that the document ends with this mutual pledge. Can you imagine starting a company and at the end looking at your co founders in the eyes and mutually pledging to one another, quote, For the support of this company, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor. Right? Probably not. Because it doesn't mean that much to you. It's just a company. But it's very powerful when it does mean that much to you. And so I think that is my enduring takeaway from the series on the Founding Fathers of the United States of America. You know, is that that fraternity, that feeling, that willingness to pledge to one another, their lives, their fortunes, and their honor is the real secret of the American revolution is the secret to our success, that sincerity, that", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/the-secret-of-the-american-revolution", "title": "The Secret of The American Revolution", "chunk_index": 8, "publication_date": "2024-07-04", "total_chunks_in_doc": 11}}

You know, these, um, their lives, their fortunes, their honor, you know, this American experiment we're in a, we're in a weird spot right now. In some ways it seems like it's winding down, right? We have over 200, 000 deaths of despair every year. We have a polarized country that can't agree on what core principles are represented by this nation. Like it looks in many ways like America is coming apart at the seams. And I don't think that would have surprised the founding fathers. Franklin, Hamilton, Washington all looked on the constitution as an imperfect document that was as good as anyone could do given the circumstances. But I don't think that they had in mind that they had solved government forever and that the future, um, and that the future health of the nation would require No further innovations, no further sacrifice from their progeny, uh, would require no further sacrifice from their progeny. Like they knew that times of crisis would come and this series has given me a renewed determination to do what they did to find solutions as difficult as it might be, and it won't be a walk in the park to get ourselves out of the mess that we're in. And as we think about what comes next, what projects or associations could lead to that kind of renewal. I think that's the bar. That we have to meet.

For the support of this, we mutually pledged to each other, our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor. If you can find that group that means that much to you, that you would make that covenant, then anything is possible. And to me, that is the secret of the American revolution. You know, independence doesn't mean isolation. It doesn't mean self reliance. No man is an island, but it's finding that cause and that people that you're willing to pledge your life for.

Welcome to the show and especially a big welcome to anyone who's coming from my first million, for those who didn't see, , my first million is running a little experiment. They're playing some episodes of how to take over the world and, uh, we're going to see how it goes. And if it goes well, then we're going to keep playing episodes on their feet. It's a big podcast for those who don't know in the tech and entrepreneurship space. It's actually one of my favorite podcasts. If you are into business, if you're into making money, if you're in detecting entrepreneurship, I suggest you check it out my first million, wherever you get your podcasts. But, uh, it's an exciting development for how to take over the world. And it should mean a slightly bigger audience and, uh, and therefore I can rationalize dedicating more of my time to this. So, uh, yeah. Expect to see, uh, a few more episodes going forward, Before today's episode, ask yourself, what if there was a formula for genius? What if you could engineer in a lab, a Caesar or a Mozart or Picasso? This episode's about a man who not only theorized that this was possible, but did it three times and you'll have to excuse me, but this one is a somewhat self-interested episode. I had my first child nine months. And yeah, that is one of the reasons that production of this podcast slowed down for a little while. But now that I have a daughter, I'm thinking about how to raise her and it got me interested in the story of a man named Laszlo. Polgar Laszlo was a Hungarian educational psychologist who studied the idea of genius. He believed that anyone could be trained to be a genius. And then he went out and improved. Um, he made his daughters, his test subjects and his three daughters went on to become three of the greatest chess champions of all time. And so obviously as someone who's trying to figure out how to raise my own daughter, this story was interesting to me. And so I think it can teach us something about how to raise a genius, how to help teach someone else to be a genius, but also something about how to be a genius yourself, how to be great and successful yourself.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/how-to-raise-a-genius-laszlo-polgar", "title": "How to Raise a Genius: Laszlo Polgar", "chunk_index": 0, "publication_date": "2021-09-17", "total_chunks_in_doc": 14}}

And so I think it can teach us something about how to raise a genius , how to help teach someone else to be a genius , but also something about how to be a genius yourself , how to be great and successful yourself . How to Raise a Genius: Laszlo Polgar: , So even if you don't have children, I think it's a worthwhile episode. So let's jump into it. Laszlo pole guard was born in 1946. He got his first degree in philosophy, his second in psycho pedagogical education, which is just a fancy way of saying he studied the psychology of different teaching methods. He had a successful career as an academic and teacher, and eventually got his PhD with a dissertation on the development of capabilities. In other words, he did his PhD on the idea of genius and developing geniuses. This really was his life. But his interest was more than academic and professional. He had a personal interest in the subject and read the biographies of more than 400 famous and successful thinkers, 400, uh, from Socrates to Einstein. And he tried to kind of piece together what were the common links between them? So obviously I love this guy. He was doing his own personal version of how to take over the world. And I feel like it's a major validation of my theory that studying these people is. So when he was after studying all these biographies, he became convinced that anyone could become a genius with the right training and education. So he decided to put his theory to the test and he dedicated his life to tutoring. And raising them to be geniuses. One problem he had is he didn't have any children yet, but luckily he found a woman who was willing to go along with his experiment. And fortunately, they also fell in love. So they got married and dedicated their lives to raising and educating children in a way that Laszlo believed would give them the best shot at becoming geniuses. This was supposed to be the ultimate test of his theory. Can you really raise anyone to be genius? Well, he's got three little lab rats that he can test this theory. And see what the results are for the area of their specialization, where they would become geniuses. He chose the field of chess. He chose chess primarily because it's easy to. He considered mathematics languages and other disciplines, but decided on chess because of its objectivity. You have winners and losers with mathematics. You can see how there could be like some politics involved. If you're in academia, you could say, you know, my daughter, I raised her to be a mathematics. But that's really difficult for the outside public to evaluate. And there's always some politics involved of, you could say, well, you could", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/how-to-raise-a-genius-laszlo-polgar", "title": "How to Raise a Genius: Laszlo Polgar", "chunk_index": 1, "publication_date": "2021-09-17", "total_chunks_in_doc": 14}}

And there ' s always some politics involved of , you could say , well , you could How to Raise a Genius: Laszlo Polgar: have certain academics who are jealous saying, well, you know, her paper really isn't that interesting or isn't that much of a breakthrough. , but with chess, you know, you have rankings, , you can see how good someone is by their winning loss. So if Paul his method worked, his children would be top ranked chess players, and no one could dispute that. So it's an objective measure. You can look at the leaderboards and see if his daughters are there. Then they really are geniuses. As he began teaching his daughters as young children, he encountered enormous opposition from the political and chess establishment. On the political front, Hungary was communist at the time. And as such private education was very much frowned upon. It was seen as elitist and working against equality for all. And if you think about it, you know, if private education is a bad thing to the authorities in Hungary, then what about private education that is specifically designed with the end goal of creating geniuses? That's going to see like even more outlandishly elitist, right? An anti-Common. So Laszlo had to fight tooth and nail to get the right, to educate his own daughters. He was absolutely dogged in petitioning for his right to do so and explaining why no, this is actually good for the state of Hungary and for communism and even so he was often willing to work in the gray area where it's kind of unclear if he was breaking the law, the chess establishment in Hungary at the time, as I mentioned also opposed him in large part because. Uh, he didn't have any sounds. He had only daughters and they really thought of chess as a men's game and something that women, especially young girls should not be interested in. So they were kind of discouraged from seriously pursuing chess and he had other obstacles as well. He didn't exactly have a huge budget as an academic who was committed to staying home and instructing his daughters. Full-time he didn't have a lot. He raised his family in a very modest, a very small apartment in Budapest.

So for my reading , it ' s a little bit of a How to Raise a Genius: Laszlo Polgar: mystery, how he made money, but it is clear they weren't living large. Uh, he was really making sacrifices in order to do this what little money he did have Laszlo spent on loads of chess books and not just books, but he had this entire card filing system that he developed his. Where he would catalog different chess positions, whether openings or mid game or end game moves. And the girls could consult this encyclopedia of chess whenever they wanted. Uh, you can see pictures of their little Budapest department and it is it's small. And there's a lot of material it's like really overflowing with, with books and all this chasse information that he prepared for them. And this was a situation that he would raise his three daughters in as his youngest, Judith would later say, quote, everything was about chess and the results were pretty astounding. He had three daughters, as I mentioned, all three, went on to become incredibly successful chess players, top players in the world, the oldest Susan, , who was born in 1969. Uh, her career started really early. She won the Budapest under 11 girls championship at age four. I don't know if you know any four year olds in your life right now. That's incredible age four. She was able to beat her father Laszlo, , at chess at age five. So that's when he took her to the local chess club in Budapest and she started beating, accomplished local chess players. She won the world under 16 girls championship at age 12. And by 15, she became the top rated women's chess player. At age 22, she became the third woman to ever be granted the title of Grandmaster, a highly coveted title in chess. I mean, it's, it's really hard to become a Grandmaster. it's really hard to become a Grandmaster, especially, you know, as a woman, as we mentioned in, in a country and in a chest establishment that is kind of discouraging your progress. Very very remarkable Laszlo, encouraged Susan to mostly compete against men. So she mostly entered in men's tournaments. And so she wasn't necessarily winning the championship every year, but eventually she did decide to compete in women's tournaments as well. And in 1996, when she finally did, she won the women's world champion. Uh, and, and I think quite easily in 2002, Susan became the first woman to win the us open blitz", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/how-to-raise-a-genius-laszlo-polgar", "title": "How to Raise a Genius: Laszlo Polgar", "chunk_index": 3, "publication_date": "2021-09-17", "total_chunks_in_doc": 14}}

Uh , and , and I think quite easily in 2002 , Susan became the first woman to win the us open blitz How to Raise a Genius: Laszlo Polgar: championship against the field, which included seven grand masters. She won that title again in 2005 and in 2006, uh, the second pole guard daughter, Sophia was born in 1974. She was the world junior under 20 rapid champion in 1986, also in 1986 at the under 14 championships, which was a boys tournament, except for her. She took second place and was declared the world as declared the world girls champion by virtue of the fact that she nearly won the boys' tournament, which was much more. In 1989, at the age of 14, Sophia won an elite chess tournament in Rome against a bunch of middle-aged men who were very accomplished and many of them were grandmasters. This became known as the sack of Rome. She was one of the top ranked women's chess players in the world. And in 1994, finished second in the world, junior chess, chess. Once again, not in the girls' junior chess championship, but the overall, and again, this is the least successful of the three. In 1996, she won the gold medal at the women's chess Olympiad, and it was the only gold medal that she won. But frankly, she would have won many, many more if it weren't for her sisters, but this was the only one that she won because it happened to be the one where neither of her sisters was competing. And, you know, to say that she's the least accomplished at the pole guard. Sisters is a, is a little tough and she might, you know, she's probably one of the top 10, certainly one of the top 20 greatest women's chess players of all time, but she's also the third best women's chess player in her own family. So that really, you know, take some of the shine off your accomplishments when she was in her early teens, she decided to pick up art and more than any of her other sisters, she has focused less on chess and more on other pursuits, including art painting, interior design, and I'm being a full-time mother as she raises her two children. The most successful of the three was the youngest. She was born in 1976 and she is the greatest women's chess player of all time, hands down and it's, it's not close. It's not really a debate.

{"text": "s chess player of all time , hands down and it ' s , it ' s not close . It ' s not really a debate . She won her first international chest tournament at age nine . She defeated a grand master for the first time . At How to Raise a Genius: Laszlo Polgar: age 11, she became the youth champion of the world, age 14 girls and boys. She became a Grandmaster herself at age 15 in 2005 at age 29, she achieved her career high ranking of numbers. And became the only woman to be ranked in the top 10 in the world. And she became the first woman to ever qualify for the men's world title championships. She was ranked number one in women's chess for more than 20 years and only lost the ranking when she. So again, she's, she's like Serena Williams, times two, uh, in terms of her dominance of women's chess, so, okay. Wow. You know, uh, we got to say for our guy Laszlo, uh, this is looking like pretty good evidence that he has it figured out in terms of how to raise. And by the way, many people assume that, , this must've been really unethical and that heat drove these girls to the edge of mental breakdown in order to achieve all of this. Right. But the girls are unanimous in saying that they had a happy childhood, that they're happy now that they do now and have always lived fulfilled and balanced lives. Even Sophia, who basically gave up chess to focus on being a mother and. As no ill will. , and she reflects on fondness with her time as a chess champion. She doesn't wish her father had done anything differently. So how did he do all of this? Luckily Laszlo wrote a book called razor genius where he breaks down his methodology for raising geniuses. And amazingly to me, this just a mean, the book is like not popular. It's not really. And hadn't even been translated into English until the blogger known as Scott Alexander of slate star codex paid to have it translated in 2017, the book was written in 1989. So for nearly 30 years, no one thought it was worth translating into English. And again, I know I'm kind of crazy about this kind of stuff, but I still just, it blows my mind that no one thought this was worth translating or studying. Um, but luckily, uh, it was translated and it's a fascinating book in part because it doesn't focus very much on the methodology of how to raise a genius. Laszlo actually focuses more on defending the idea of raising geniuses and why it should be done in. Why, why anyone should do it? Why you should do it?

{"text": "' t focus very much on the methodology of how to raise a genius . Laszlo actually focuses more on defending the idea of raising geniuses and why it should be done in . Why , why anyone should do it ? Why you should do it ? The title How to Raise a Genius: Laszlo Polgar: of the book is not how to raise a genius. It's raise a genius with an exclamation point. It's an exhortation, a plea for you to raise a genius. And that's because according to Laszlo, it's not hard. It's actually really simple to raise a genius. The difficult part is actually convincing people that they should do it. But if you want to, you can. Okay. So with Laszlo saying, geniuses are not born, they're raised and it's not even that hard. How do you do it? Einstein? How do you raise a genius? Okay. The first step, according to Laszlo is to begin education. Uh, to quote from the book, he says, quote, in my pedagogical system, early childhood occupies a central place in my concept early childhood. That is the period between three and six years. The preschool years are more important and much more in need of utilization than thought in the current. By my principle. One should begin instruction, which is in my concept, nothing other than a serious game at the age of four or five. Okay. So he wants to start education really, really early. And he's not just talking about general education. He's talking about specialized education in the field that the child is to be a genius in. And this is because according to him, this early stage is when a person's brain is most plastic, most able to learn new things to change. Uh, he said in his book, quote, the first characteristic of genius education, I could say the most important novelty distinguishing it from contemporary instruction and it's necessary. Precondition is early specialization directed at one concrete field. It is indeed true. What Homer said, a person cannot be experienced or first in everything because of this parents should choose a specific field at their discretion. It is only important that by the age of. Some physical or mental field should be chosen and the child can set out on their voyage. Okay. So that is obviously much earlier than most people think. Choosing a specialized area of education for their children. Um, most people don't undertake specialized education until they're in college. Right. So, uh, So, obviously this is a much different way to approach it. How do you choose the area of specialization? So he thinks in one sense, a child can learn almost anything.

So it ' s kind of arbitrary . A parent should maybe How to Raise a Genius: Laszlo Polgar: just decide, but also he does make nods. He, he acknowledges that the child should have some choice. So if they really hate the field that you've chosen for them, uh, you should, should change. You should switch and you should try to kind of identify something that they are drawn towards, or that they really. Um, if you can, what should instruction look like when a kid is just four or five years old? , heard him mentioned it in that quote, that it's just kind of play. But he says you shouldn't push them at all, which seems sensible. Uh, you can begin to push them a little bit, you know, encourage them to work harder after age six, but before then learning should be all play. It should be 100% fun and enjoyable for the child. Uh, after that quote, he says the ability to learn by play decreases after six years of age, when assimilation of information becomes more difficult, mental work. Which, um, so obviously, yeah, after they turn six, you have to push them a little bit and, and get them to be somewhat disciplined, which is not to say that, you know, at age six, everything changes. Now you have to be a task master and treat your child like a slave Laszlo says, quote, thus, I generally do not rigidly separate learning from play or work from hobbies at an adult level. I support doing work. That one likes, which is thus an enjoyable occupied. But this can come about only when in choosing we come to passionately. Enjoy it. So that's another thing he emphasizes is a sense of play of passion, of enjoyment, of what you're doing. He calls it the unification of work in play. He says, you should never tell a child. Hey, get to work. Don't play or the opposite. You shouldn't say them, you know, play have fun. Don't don't work so hard. They should never get the idea in their head. At all that work is the opposite of play that they're mutually exclusive. You should try to get in their head, that work. The thing that they're studying this, this main thing they're specializing on is fun is play. They're the same thing. The other thing he strongly recommends is specialist.

{"text": "re studying this , this main thing they ' re specializing on is fun is play . They ' re the same thing . The other thing he strongly recommends is specialist . Uh , he thinks , you know , we already mentioned that , but he thinks in How to Raise a Genius: Laszlo Polgar: early childhood, , kids should spend five to six hours per day studying a single subject. And the immediate objection by many people is whoa. If you specialize the kids to see. Aren't they going to be like one dimensional and not well-rounded, you know, if you're spending that many hours per day on a single subject, we think of all the things they're not learning. I think of all the experiences they're missing and it's worth pointing out that all of his daughters speak between five and eight languages. We're fantastic athletes. , Judith in particular could have become professional table tennis player. She wanted, they were great. Conversationalists wrote various articles and books. They're generally engaging people with varied interest. Uh, as previously mentioned, Sophia went on to become a painter. So it's not like they were chess robots. I don't think you could say from looking at this experience that any of his kids were one dimensional or we're missing out on big life experiences. And yeah. Obviously, according to Laszlo, no specializing, doesn't make you one dimensional. In fact, by learning to do one thing extremely well, you teach yourself and you teach your child how to learn, how to set yourself up, to learn subsequent things. And, uh, so they can have success in others. He brings up the Seneca quote, uh, who said, who is everywhere, is nowhere in it's true. The person who just sort of dabbles in everything. Oftentimes actually doesn't learn how to do any of those things well, and is probably less well-rounded than the person who specializes at least to some extent. And so again, I said that, , Laszlo's methodology is like pretty simple, pretty easy, and that's really it. Those are the main points of genius education. According to last. One start early to specialize and three, the unification of work in play, , help them love what they do. He does have other minor notes on genius education. I'll just run through some of them really quickly. He says that the optimal state for high performance or optimal performance is relaxed and aggressive. And I have tried to bear that in mind, whenever I'm doing something, I'm trying to keep it in mind right now as I'm narrating. But I think it's a really great head state to try and put yourself in aggressive.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/how-to-raise-a-genius-laszlo-polgar", "title": "How to Raise a Genius: Laszlo Polgar", "chunk_index": 8, "publication_date": "2021-09-17", "total_chunks_in_doc": 14}}
{"text": "tried to bear that in mind , whenever I ' m doing something , I ' m trying to keep it in mind right now as I ' m narrating . But I think it ' s a really great head state to try and put yourself in aggressive . How to Raise a Genius: Laszlo Polgar: You're looking for opportunities. You are kind of leaned forward, you're, you're attacking, you're aggressive, but you're relaxed. You're not too intense. You're not, um, going to psychologically break down and things don't work out. So I just think that's a really smart way to think about the optimal head state for high-performance relaxed and aggressive. Um, another note he says, quote and intensive collaborative contact between the child and an adult must be formed in which the child does not feel subordinate. Okay. So in other words, The instructor, the tutor, or if you yourself are instructing your child, you should kind of put them, treat them almost as a peer. They shouldn't be made, made to feel subordinate. He also says that a child should experience success early and should not experience failure too often. In other words, if you got a kid playing soccer football for our friends outside of. Don't put them in the super advanced league where the older kids are way more athletic than them and just dominating them. Like, sure. It might be good for them on some level to get used to playing against superior competition. But according to Laszlo, it's going to do more harm than good cause it's going to crush their confidence. So especially when they're young, you should keep them at a level where they get used to. And then only move them up a level, uh, when they're ready to start winning on a regular basis at that level too, Laszlo also thinks every child should learn chess and every child should learn a foreign language, no matter what they're specializing in. Because according to him, it's an easy way for them to master a new skill and teaches them about learning. So, yeah, those are some of the minor notes that I took, but those three things are really the heart of his pedagogical theory start early, specialized unify work and play. And once you start looking at the world through that lens, you see it everywhere, especially when it comes to children's specializing early. So if you look at history, many of the great ones started their specialized started their specialized education really early, for example, Serena and Venus Williams through the greatest women's tennis players. Started serious tennis instruction from their father at age four, which meets that time deadline, that, that last load put out there.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/how-to-raise-a-genius-laszlo-polgar", "title": "How to Raise a Genius: Laszlo Polgar", "chunk_index": 9, "publication_date": "2021-09-17", "total_chunks_in_doc": 14}}

Started serious tennis instruction from their father at age four , which meets that time deadline , that , that last load put out there . How to Raise a Genius: Laszlo Polgar: Father Richard Williams later said he thought he started them too early and, and wishes that he hadn't started them so early. But according to pull guard, no he's wrong. Uh, starting them so early was actually one of the things that gave them such an advantage. Mozart began playing the piano at age four and began composing at age five. There's a, this is just a side note, but there's a great story, uh, about Mozart that, uh, someone comes up to him on the street and says, uh, you know, Mozart, how do I, uh, how do I begin to learn to compose as well as you. And Mozart says, well, how old are you? He says I'm 22. And he says, oh, you're too young to start composing already because I'm too young. You started composing when you were only five in Mozart says, yeah, but I didn't run around asking someone how to do it. Okay. But that has nothing to do with anything. Uh, John Von Neumann, possibly the greatest mathematician of all time began his math education around age four or five. I actually couldn't find when he began. But, uh, it is recorded that he was able to divide six digit numbers. By the time he was six, which means obviously he had to start serious math by at least age five Picasso was the son of a painter and a painting teacher. And his first word was peace short for lobbies the Spanish word for pencil. He began his formal painting education at age seven, but was already receiving informal instruction from his father by age five. And so I could go on, but it is actually really remarkable as you look through history, how many geniuses began. Their art or their field of study by the age of five. It's not all of them, of course, but Laszlo definitely seems to have a point here that it really helps. But as I mentioned, the rest of Laszlo's book is a defense of the idea of intentionally raising geniuses. I think the idea it needs to be defended whenever I have brought up the story of the poll guards to friends. Uh, and ask them if they think I should raise my daughter to be a genius, they have reacted with shock and borderline disgust and horror. Um, so I do think it's important to outline his defense of why it's a worthwhile project.

{"text": "if they think I should raise my daughter to be a genius , they have reacted with shock and borderline disgust and horror . Um , so I do think it ' s important to outline his defense of why it ' s a worthwhile project . He begins by How to Raise a Genius: Laszlo Polgar: quoting the Scots English historian and polymath Thomas Carlyle, who wrote quote, everything that we see realized in this world is nothing more than the external result. The practical realization, the embodiment of thoughts that lived in eminent people throughout the world. The soul of the full story of the world is we may assert there. So according to Carlisle and probably according to pull guard as well, when it comes to pushing their field forward, geniuses don't contribute two or three more times than the average person. They contribute something more like a hundred times more than the average contributor in their field. Art history, uh, our culture, our society, science, art, everything is pushed forward. Monumentally by these geniuses. As Paul Gar says, quote, a genius is a collective creation who becomes a communal treasure. Okay. So if geniuses are such a treasure, well, why doesn't anyone want to raise one? Why, why don't all people do this? Well, here are a few of the objections that Laszlo raises in response to, and I've heard a lot of these as well, so we'll go through them one by one. First, the idea that geniuses aren't well-rounded \\ I already addressed this a little bit. Obviously I believe that this does not need to be the case. The geniuses can be well-rounded. I mean, I think it's funny. Like if you look at the Olympics, , do you think that the average Olympian has read more? Or fewer books than just your average person. Let's say your average American, since I live in America. And I'm willing to bet that it's more than that, that your average Olympian is more well-read than your average person. Right? So I just think this is not true at all. People who specialize in who are great at one thing, tend to also be pretty good at other things. They tend to be more well-rounded than your average person. And obviously we see this with the poll guards who were incredible linguists and athletes and other things. You may ask yourself, like, how is this possible? How do you have the energy to do all these things? Have you have the energy to become the top women's chess player in the world and still have time to be competitive ping pong player and learn five languages. And, uh, I mean, obviously my first answer is, I don't know, I've", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/how-to-raise-a-genius-laszlo-polgar", "title": "How to Raise a Genius: Laszlo Polgar", "chunk_index": 11, "publication_date": "2021-09-17", "total_chunks_in_doc": 14}}
{"text": "energy to become the top women ' s chess player in the world and still have time to be competitive ping pong player and learn five languages . And , uh , I mean , obviously my first answer is , I don ' t know , I ' ve How to Raise a Genius: Laszlo Polgar: never done it, but I do think that it comes from this idea of the unification of work and play. So they were spending five to six hours. Not in Drudge work that they hated, but in playing, in doing things that they loved. So instead of sapping their energy as normal school does, it gave them energy. When they were done playing chess for six hours, they had plenty of energy to do athletics or study languages or study anything else. The other objection that you often hear is that these geniuses are going to be. You know, you're just going to be worked to the bone. They'll have no friends, they'll have a horrible relationship with their father. Who's pushing them way too hard and they'll have these miserable lives and their childhood will be stolen from them. Now, all three pole guard, girls refute this, they all say they're happy. And Laszlo refutes this in his book. He writes quote, I do not assert that the way of genius leads necessarily to happiness, but indeed that it is more likely to than otherwise as it concretely concerns my daughters, they confirm, thank God this last. Those who think otherwise did not seem to have enough information or maybe are envious or jealous. My daughters are in fact fulfilled, joyful, happy people. Those who know them personally can confirm this. I will say that I understand why people would have this concern. We've all seen the father, Who wishes he had been a baseball star. So he berates his son, forces him to practice baseball all the time because he's trying to live his dreams through his son. Or sometimes it's the mom here in the United States. It's the cheerleader mom. Who's forcing her daughter to do cheerleading all the time, but you know, that's not pull GARS method at all. You've got to do it for the benefit of the child, according to Laszlo and not for your own benefit, it's gotta be something that they enjoy doing and you can't force them to live out your dream. And obviously we see this in his idea of the unification of work in play. If they're not enjoying it, then it's just not going to work. Okay. So geniuses can be well-rounded. They can be happy. What other objections are there? Um, the last objection that I hear all the time is that they will be.

Um , the last objection that I hear all the time is that they will be . That these How to Raise a Genius: Laszlo Polgar: geniuses won't be like other kids. Right. So who cares if they're successful or they're happy? Okay. I'll grant you that they might be, they might be successful at this and they might be happy, but they won't be like other kids. And this is the one criticism that I actually think is true. . One reporter asked Laszlo's neighbor. If the pole guard girls were happy and the neighbor responded, quote, certainly although maybe in other ways than other girls. In other words, yeah, they're happy, but in a little bit of a different way, they're not like other girls, they are a little different and this is by definition. True. To be great.

{"text": "Thomas Edison: Hello and welcome to how to take over the world. This is Ben Wilson. It's good to be back. Today I'm going to be talking about Thomas Edison, the world renowned inventor and businessman. I'm really glad that I chose to do this episode about Edison because honestly, he's underrated. I learned a lot while doing this one, and I think you will learn a lot listening to it. He was an unbelievably prolific inventor, filing 1093 patents in his lifetime. Among, those are two of the most important inventions of all time. The light bulb and recorded sound. And Thomas Edison is interesting because he is, in many ways the original inventor, entrepreneur, celebrity. There is sort of a playbook. Now, if you think about someone like bill Gates or Steve jobs or Elon Musk and that playbook for how to be a famous inventor originated with Thomas Edison. He was really the first one to do it. In fact, Edison's celebrity really surpassed any of those guys. I mean, yeah, bill Gates and Elon Musk, they are famous nowadays, very famous, but Edison was literally the predominant celebrity of his day. The most famous man and celebrity is almost kind of underselling what he was. He was viewed in these almost mythic, godlike terms. After he died in the USA, there was an effort made to extinguish all the electric lights in the entire country for a minute. As a tribute to Edison. He seemed to represent progress itself, and the idea that man had mastered the elements and could do anything. Now, Edison was born in this era of incredible change, and he wrote that to levels of celebrity's previously only enjoyed by Kings and conquerors. So I want to study on this podcast is two things. One, Edison, the businessman, and inventor. And how he was able to achieve success in those domains to the extent that he did because it was truly remarkable. And then secondly, Edison, this celebrity and how he's able to spin the perception of his success into nearly unparalleled fame and influence. This first episode will cover Edison's life through the invention of recorded sound. And then the second part, which should be coming out in just a week or two, will cover his life from the invention of the light bulb to his death.

{"text": "cover his life from the invention of the light bulb to his death . But before we dive in , let ' s hear a word from our first ever sponsor . As you studied the lives of these great historical figures , you started to pick up on little Thomas Edison: similarities. Some of them are really obvious like that. These are all very intelligent and hardworking people, but other similarities seem rather odd. And one of those odd similarities is the way they dress. They all seem to adopt the prevailing fashion, but with just a little bit of flair to make them stand out from the crowd. Julius Caesar had his fringe on his Toga, Alexander the great war Medusa on his breastplate, and of course, Steve jobs wore his famous mock neck shirt. Well, I reached out to Taft to be a sponsor of today's show because they fit into that tradition perfectly. Taft is a men's footwear brand that specializes in boots and shoes. They take shoes with a very classic and timeless look and mix up the design just a little bit and give their shoes and a flair to stand out in a really cool way. All their boots and shoes are handcrafted in Europe. They're incredibly well-made. They're super comfortable. They last forever, and you'll look great. I wear my tank boots all the time, and they look and feel incredible. So head over to Taft clothing.com and use the code how to 10 for 10% off your order of any fully priced boot shoe or sneaker. Again, you'll really love them. Wear the shoes that Caesar or Alexander the great would wear if they were alive. Go to Taft, clothing.com and use code how to 10. So let's start at the beginning. Thomas Alva Edison was born in Milan, Ohio on February 11th, 1847 he came from a family, a very contrarian men. His grandfather had opposed the American revolution and been forced to flee to Canada when the U S successfully gained independence from great Britain, but then his father, Samuel made the opposite mistake and back a failed rebellion in Canada. And was forced to flee back to the U S Thomas was the youngest of seven children, born to a moderately wealthy family. He was born in Ohio, but mostly grew up in port Huron, Michigan, a frontier town right on the border with Canada, about 50 miles North of Detroit. It was a major transportation hub located right where the st Clair river meets Lake Huron, and also along a major train line growing up, he actually went by his middle name, so his family called him Alva and his friends called him out. He was a medium height. He stood five foot nine and adulthood, and he was really scrawny as a child, though he eventually filled", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/thomas-edison", "title": "Thomas Edison", "chunk_index": 1, "publication_date": "2020-04-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 53}}

He stood five foot nine and adulthood , and he was really scrawny as a child , though he eventually filled Thomas Edison: to a medium build, but the feature that most frequently drew people's comments and attention were his piercing gray eyes as a child. Thomas Edison attended a few months of school, but he was mostly homeschooled by his mother. And you might think, okay, yeah, frontier town, 1850s. It was normal to be homeschooled, but no, actually most kids went to school. Uh, they went somewhat irregularly. Things were definitely a little different back then, but Edison was unusual in the fact that he attended very little school and was almost entirely homeschooled. And that's because Thomas Edison was not like the other boys. He didn't fit in naturally. He was, he was kind of odd. A schoolmate wrote years later, quote, I often run across him in town with just as dirty nose and face as the other boys, but he seemed to be thinking of something all the time and not playing much. Another wrote that. He was, quote. A child that was always doing funny things different from other children, love to be by himself, and this aloofness was taken for stupidity. Actually, his father later said, was he a remarkably smart boy? Why? No. Some folks thought he was a little adult. I believe teacher told us to keep him in the streets because he would never make a scholar. All he ate went to sport his brain, and he was puny. He was forever asking me questions and when I would tell him, I don't know, he would say, why don't you know? And it's difficult to know how much of this aloofness and this kind of weirdness was due to his hearing. Addison had progressive deafness that got worse throughout his life, and we don't have good records of when this first started because Edison didn't really like to talk about it. All we have is a single statement when he said, I haven't heard a bird sing since I was 12 years old. So it's clear that he had already started to go death as a child, but that doesn't seem to explain all of his social aloofness. He was also just different. He thought different. He acted different from other boys his age. He had a very analytical mind. As a consequence, he looked at the world kind of like an alien the way some really smart people do. At one point in his childhood, he burned down his father's barn. And when his furious father asked him why,", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/thomas-edison", "title": "Thomas Edison", "chunk_index": 2, "publication_date": "2020-04-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 53}}

And when his furious father asked him why , Thomas Edison: he said, I just wanted to see what it would do. So his deafness combined with his kind of oddness, set him apart and isolated him. The thing that saved him in the midst of this isolation was his mother. Mrs Edison was a very strong and literary woman. She saw the intelligence in her son, nurtured it, believed in him, and told himself she homeschooled him by buying textbooks and reading through them with young Al. Edison would later write quote, I use never to be able to get along at school. I don't know now what it was, but I was always at the foot of the class. My father thought I was stupid, and at last I almost decided I must really be a dunce. My mother was the making of me. She was so true. So sure of me, and I felt that I had someone to live for someone I must not disappoint, but his mother's education could only take him so far. And at age 12, young Edison became an independent man, and his young adulthood from 12 up through his teenage years is the most frontier America Mark Twain sounding story you have ever heard in your entire life. In fact, if Mark Twain had written it, you might say it's good, but it's a little much tone it down a little bit. Um, it starts, like I said, when Thomas is 12 years old and the family falls on hard times due to a big economic recession. So Edison takes a job as a newsboy, eventually selling papers on the train. To and from Detroit, he had an entrepreneurial streak from a young age and as soon selling other things on the train as well, from candies to fruit and other produce. As he's doing that, he realizes that the produce is cheaper in the big city of Detroit than it was in his small town. So he starts buying produce in Detroit and taking it home when selling it at a profit, uh, on the streets of port Huron. And pretty soon he's growing this little business, setting up a couple of fruit stands and hiring out other little boys to Mandarin. And so it is that age 13 Edison was running a thriving business with multiple under Hage employees. He even bribes the train conductors because technically he's transporting goods on the train without paying, and he bribes them in the best possible way. He goes to their wives and offers them berries and butter at wholesale prices. So now even the wives of the train conductors.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/thomas-edison", "title": "Thomas Edison", "chunk_index": 3, "publication_date": "2020-04-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 53}}

They're invested in Thomas Edison's succeeding, and so of course, the conductors allow him to continue to transport his goods for free. One of my favorite stories from the stage of Edison's childhood is how he reacts to news about the battle of Shiloh. This is all happening during the American civil war, and for those of you who don't know, the battle of Shiloh was one of the biggest battles of the war. Edison is in Detroit. When new starts to come in about the battle and he can see that it's a huge sensation, people are following it like it's the super bowl. So he formulates a plan. He walks into the Detroit free press and buys a thousand copies of their paper. He doesn't actually have the money to do that, so he buys the paper on credit with no collateral. Essentially they do it because they're charmed by this precocious young kid demanding to buy a thousand papers. And he then bribes the Telegraph operators to send word to all the towns between Detroit and his home of port Huron that the battle of Shiloh had commenced was underway, and there was more news to follow in today's edition of the Detroit free press, which by the way, will be coming on the evening train. Well, of course, Edison takes his normal evening train home and he gets to the first stop and there is a mob of people at the train station waiting to buy papers. He had to raise the price from 5 cents of paper to 25 cents a paper just to keep from running out right away. And he ends up making a huge profit on selling all a thousand papers at a markup of 25 cents five times its normal price. And Edison gets up to all sorts of plots and schemes. As a young teenager at 15 he decides that rather than sell someone else's paper, he's going to start his own. He calls it the weekly Harold. He brings a printing press onto the train. And starts printing in this office that he's made for himself in a little spare room and creates the first ever newspaper printed on a moving train. The paper does decently well. Actually. It gets a maximum circulation of 400 copies a week, uh, at its height. But even this enterprise is not enough for curious young Edison. He has been experimenting with chemistry sets in his basement, and that was becoming his true passion. In fact, he's", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/thomas-edison", "title": "Thomas Edison", "chunk_index": 4, "publication_date": "2020-04-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 53}}

He has been experimenting with chemistry sets in his basement , and that was becoming his true passion . In fact , he ' s Thomas Edison: so passionate about learning science and chemistry and conducting these experiments that he sets up a chemistry lab on the train. Um, unfortunately this leads to his Icarus moment when he goes to far reaches too high and the lab catches fire which not only puts an end to his chemistry experiments, but actually gets him kicked off the train with his chemistry set, his printing press and everything else he's done on the train between port Huron and Detroit as his career as a budding merchant is put to an end, Edison picks up a new interest. He becomes a Telegraph operator, what they called at the time, a station agent. And Edison jumps in and immediately becomes obsessed. He spends 18 hours a day Learning Morse code, learning how to send and receive the dots and dashes that make up Telegraph messaging. and in short order he becomes a pretty good station agent. He apparently became a very good receiver, which is of course when you listen to the Morse code and transcribed the messages. But he was always a relatively self self sender, which is funny because you know, he was mostly deaf. You'd think that he would have trouble hearing and transcribing the messages. But no, that was what he was a good at. In fact, eventually after a few years, he becomes the best in the country. Um, he could receive and transcribe even the fastest messages with few to no errors. But yeah, never was a great sender. And this is enough to really make a name for himself in the community of Telegraph operators around the country. In 1863, he leaves Michigan and becomes what was called a traveling tramp operator. Um, cause this area was more or less frontier country in America, the American, Midwest, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, all those States were very much still developing and settling. So new towns and cities were popping up all the time and many were growing rapidly. So it was a very fluid and changing scene. And the areas where station agents were needed was changing all the time. So station agents were hopping from city to city as needs cropped up, often sharing room and board with each other as well as tips. For where to find good whiskey and pretty girls as they moved from city to city. Hence they were called tramp operators. They actually didn't call themselves that. They called themselves sparkers or lightning slingers, which are both very steampunk.

And it ' s funny to me cause it seems exactly what kids of that age would still call themselves if they Thomas Edison: were around today. They were a tight knit group of intelligent and technically skilled 20 somethings. Who were well educated in a very frontier sort of way. Not a lot of theory and formal university training, but a lot of experimentation and practical knowledge. They were also dealing on a daily basis with some of the most advanced and sophisticated technology in the world at the time. And this created a perfect storm for experimentation, for learning, for innovation, and also for hi-jinks. I've talked before about the type of maniacs phenomenon, and it was in full effect here. In fact, this is sort of a textbook example, and it's crazy how much it resembles Silicon Valley in its heyday, both around the frontiers of America, born a generation or two after it was settled. And during a time of really rapid population growth, both had access to the most advanced technology at the time. Silicon chips in the case of California telegraphs, in the case of Edison and his contemporaries, both scenes were started and run by men in their twenties who were obsessed with tinkering. And both scenes were dominated by playful applications. The new technology, especially for the use of practical jokes. And in the same way that Steve jobs was kind of the King practical joker and his circle, Thomas Edison was the King practical joker. And his. That's another funny little coincidence that we see. For whatever reason, great innovators are also very often great practical jokers. Most of the practical jokes that Edison and his buddies were doing focused on one thing physically shocking, unsuspecting bystanders. Remember, this is a world where electricity is essentially a brand new technology. There was no power grid. Electricity was only used to send Telegraph messages, and your average person had no experience with it whatsoever. So when people get shocked, they have no idea what is happening to them. And so the Telegraph operators who did understand it had endless fun with this. There is a story of Edison putting a wire in some shallow water and flipping the current whenever people walk through it and their arms would fly up over their heads and then he turned it off after a couple of seconds. And these people's arms would fall back down to their sides and they look around completely bewildered and what had just happened to them while Edison in his traveling tramp operator buddies are cracking up, looking down from a nearby window.

But Edison wasn ' t just innovating with his practical jokes . He ' s all starting to invent . The first thing he comes up with Thomas Edison: is a clever device that records incoming transmissions so that it can be played back slower and soon. Inventing becomes an obsession, like a real obsession, like a borderline unhealthy obsession. In fact, Edison starts to take on an appearance of a junkie. Basically. He sounds remarkably like a drug addict. He's well paid, but he's always broke because he's spending all his money on spare parts and extra batteries. He barely sleeps. He was notorious his whole career for pulling all nighters and only sleeping when he absolutely had to. He would sit at his work bench and invent and tinker and work until he just passed out or lay down and sleep for an hour or two and then get right back at it. He always looked disheveled and dirty because whenever he did sleep. It was usually him falling asleep in his work clothes at the work bench. And so he also rarely changes and almost never buys new clothes. Heel sticks on a really gone to appearance because he's barely ever eating. And if you listen to this podcast, you know, this is one of my hobby horses, um, that all these great men wear light eaters, Caesar, Napoleon, Putin, Steve jobs, all of them that we've covered so far, at least. And I tried to let this rest. I decided that when I started doing this episode that I wasn't going to bring it up anymore, even if it didn't turn out. Edison was a light eater because I'm starting to sound like a freak who's weirdly obsessed with this one little thing, which is kind of true. But then I started reading the Edmund Morris biography. And this is the second paragraph of the entire book. Okay. He said, quote from earliest youth, he had half starved himself, even in early middle age, while earning big money and enabling two successive wives to fatten on oat cuisine, he would eat no more than six ounces a meal. Generally only four. And drink nothing except a milk and flavored water. A man can't think clearly. When he's tanking up, he would say, okay, so rant over. But I do want to make the point that Edison was commented by a ton of people by his friends and associates. This was something really remarkable about him, that he ate hardly anything. And so with all these things put together, he's becoming sort of and invention junkie. He's obsessed with it, barely eating, barely", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/thomas-edison", "title": "Thomas Edison", "chunk_index": 7, "publication_date": "2020-04-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 53}}

And so with all these things put together , he ' s becoming sort of and invention junkie . He ' s obsessed with it , barely eating , barely Thomas Edison: sleeping. He loves it. He can't get enough of it. And then he has like an episode. He has a moment that almost eagerly parallels an incident from Julia Caesar's life. He's studying Michael Faraday's book experimental researches to try and figure out a solution for one of his telegraphic inventions. And fair day was a very famous English scientist. One day, Edison comes home at 4:00 AM and rather than go to bed, he starts studying. Fair day. Until he bursts out to his roommate quote, I am now 21 I may live to be 50 can I get as much done as heated? I have got so much to do in life is so short. I am going to hustle. And if you remember, Cesar had an incident where he sees a statue of Alexander the great and burst into tears because Alexander had already accomplished so much by his age. So like Caesar Edison decides he has to hustle the next year in 1868 he moves out to Boston where he drops out from being a station agent and starts a business where he can focus more fully on inventing. His first invention is an electric vote counter, which totally flops. But then he starts to develop advanced telegraphy technology for the financial sector. You'll remember from the Ross child episode that getting information faster than your peers creates enormous financial opportunities. So he's helping these bankers in Boston, in New York, by creating the first electric stock ticker machine. But more than anything, by creating various techniques for sending more messages faster. Uh, he's getting them prices of commodities like gold and also prices of stocks before anyone else. So they can profit off that information. And so as great as Boston was, if you're going to be working with bankers and finance seers, you gotta be in New York city. So he moves down from Boston to Newark, New Jersey, which is just across the river from New York and moves his business down there as well. In 1874, Tom invents his first mass market product. The inductor corium, which is essentially a machine that shocks you. Uh, this being the 1870s, people are like, Oh, awesome. Just what I need, and actually sells pretty well. It was marketed as something that should be in every family as a specific cure for rheumatism and as an inexhaustible fount of amusement. Look, I know some people tend to glamorize the good old days.

I can be guilty of this . But I for one , am grateful to Thomas Edison: live in an age where people are not so bored that they will sit around an induction coil and shock themselves for hours on end just for entertainment. His other consumer facing invention was the electric pen. The best way to think about an electric pen is it was like a tattoo pen, except instead of skin, it made perforations in a stensul. You could then roll ink over the Stenzel to make hundreds of copies of a handwritten note. It was actually exactly like a tattoo pen. The first tattoo pens, even modern tattoo pens were basically made by simply adapting the Edison electric pen to be used on skin. But the success of these inventions are modest compared to his invention of the quadroplex. Which is a system for sending up to four signals across the same Telegraph line, which is a big deal because it increases the bandwidth of communication a lot, right? Um, four X is it, the quadruplex is really successful both financially and in terms of raising Thomas Edison's profile amongst fellow scientists and fellow inventors he gets married in 1871 to a 16 year old by the name of Mary Stilwell. Which uh, was not as weird back then. Um, being the work addict he is, he works until well after midnight on the day of his wedding. But regardless of his work addiction, these are good years. He's married and in love. The business is doing well. He's got over 70 employees and he's having a great time thinking of new inventions all day. The quadruplex sells so well that he's got some more money and decides he wants to move out to the country where he can have a little more room to experiment, a little, little more elbow room. So he moves his laboratory to Menlo park, New Jersey, and Menlo park was essentially the middle of nowhere. It's just 20 miles from Manhattan, but it was a part of New Jersey that had been completely undeveloped up to that time. So that was what he liked about it. It was close to his clients in New York, but at the same time, kind of out in the country. So Edison moves his operations out of Menlo park, and it's like Disneyland, but for inventors and electricians. But this paradise is broken in 1876 when Edison hears rumors about an invention that threatens to undo all of his hard one success that he got with the quadruplex. Alexander Graham bell has invented the telephone. Now the times of homes being wired up with telephone wires was still long in the future.

{"text": "Edison hears rumors about an invention that threatens to undo all of his hard one success that he got with the quadruplex . Alexander Graham bell has invented the telephone . Now the times of homes being wired up with telephone wires was still long in the future . Neither Thomas Edison: Edison nor bell really envisioned this quite yet. They saw the telephone as the evolutionary next step of the Telegraph. And in their minds, what the telephone did promise to do was make Edison's quadroplex obsolete. Even if you're able to send four Morse code messages at the same time, it's still not as efficient as just being able to pick up a phone and simply tell someone a message. Luckily for Edison, while Bell's telephone was technically capable of carrying sound, it wasn't yet a very practical invention. It couldn't carry messages very far or very clearly. The sound was really garbled and it got even more distorted the further the signal had to carry. So the race was on to create a functional telephone, something that could actually be used in Telegraph stations. Edison is as ever completely obsessed with the problem and with inventing. He's working day and night every day to build a new transmitter, and his approach is to just try every material possible until something works. There are essentially two parts to the transmitter, a hard casing, and a diaphragm. For the casing. He tries graphite, carbon dust, um, led. Anything else that seems like it might do the trick. Uh, and the diaphragm got even weirder. He's testing rubber leather cloth, silk, ivory pig's bladder fish guts. I mean, he's just trying any substance he can think of to see if it will work for this diaphragm to help carry sound better on this new transmitter. But it works. I mean, eventually he finds a couple of substances that work and Edison's carbon transmitter vastly improved the telephone. Whereas Bell's original telephone barely allowed you to make out the outlines of what the person was saying on the other end. Edison's transmitter more or less, sounded like a telephone that we're used to. So it was an enormous improvement. The question was would improve the telephone as much as whatever improvement Alexander Graham bell had been working on since he invented the telephone. He had also been trying to improve it and make it so that. You know, you could, you could hear it and it could sound better. Bell had not been idle Western union, which was the Telegraph company that had a near monopoly on all the wires in the United States decided to stage a competition between Edison's transmitter and Alexander Graham Bell's new transmitter, new telephone.

{"text": "company that had a near monopoly on all the wires in the United States decided to stage a competition between Edison ' s transmitter and Alexander Graham Bell ' s new transmitter , new telephone . And when they put them head to head , it turned out to be Thomas Edison: a blowout. Edison's phone could pick up a whisper from three feet away and transmit at 70 miles, whereas Bell's telephone couldn't even carry a shouted call from New York to Newark. So with that, essentially Edison had won the first round of the telephone battles. And I think there's a really important lesson to be drawn from this victory. One of Edison's greatest weaknesses turned out to be one of his greatest advantages. In this instance. And that weakness was that he was not a particularly good theoretical scientist. He didn't really know the underlying physics and chemistry all that. Well, I'm not, I'm not trying to say he wasn't like ignorant of the science he did. He knew the basic principles of science. Um, but he was self-taught. Right. He didn't know the theory nearly as well as his peers who were Harvard educated or who had gone to universities. In London or Paris, you know, he was by comparison, a tinkerer, and he compensated for that by acting like a tinkerer. He experimented like crazy with a telephone and later with the electric light bulb he didn't really try to reason it out. He didn't start with first principles and, and think his way to his inventions. He just dove in and started trying to stuff and he was just unbelievably persistent. He tried and he tried until he brute force his way into a solution, into an answer. Listen to how he described his own process and the way he viewed genius. Edison said, quote, everything on earth depends on will. I never had an idea in my life. I've got no imagination. I never dream. My so called inventions already existed in the environment. I took them out. I've created nothing. Nobody does. There is no such thing as an idea. Being brain born. Everything comes from the outside. The industrious one coaxes it from the environment. The drone lets it lie there while he goes off to the baseball game. The genius hangs around his laboratory day and night. If anything, he's there to catch it. If he wasn't, it might happen just the same, only it would never be his.

Um , it reminds me of an experiment frequently cited and discussed where different groups of people are put in teams and asked to make a tower as tall as they can out of marshmallows , scotch tape and some spaghetti sticks . And they have 18 minutes Thomas Edison: to make this tower. And I did this when I was in a consulting firm, and the famous result from the study is that kindergarteners actually regularly outperform business school students, um, among others, also lawyers and CEOs. Um, and actually when I did this experiment with, with my consulting firm, our tower was shorter than the average tower created by a team of kindergarteners. Uh, so why would that be? Well, usually adults spend the first five to 10 minutes discussing how they're going to build. And putting together a plan and debating ideas for the best way to build a structure out of these weird substances. And kindergartners don't do that. They just start sticking spaghetti into marshmallows and taping it up and building, and then, you know when their tower collapses, and it usually does, it's only been a couple of minutes. So they just fix it and adapt on the fly, or they try something different. They try a new way of building the tower. And so they spend less time planning than adults do, and more time just trial and error and they trial and error. They're way too taller towers. When we did this experiment at the consulting firm, many of us had, you know, these very nice looking towers that were either pyramids or kind of square looking structures that you'd probably imagine, and the team that actually won, they got the highest tower, didn't look anything like that. It looked like this total freak show of a structure. That they had just kind of, they started experimenting from the very beginning and, uh, it was kind of leaning and weird, but you know, it worked. It was the tallest by far. So anyway, obviously there's a takeaway from all this. Um, I would say that it is plan less, do more. You have to try and fail and try and fail until you find something that works. Whether that's in business, art, sports, writing, whatever it may be. That was the approach. That worked for Edison, and I think it's the approach that works for most people. Most people spend more time planning and thinking that they need to, and less time just getting in reps, trying, experimenting and failing and figuring out things that do work the hard way. But okay, back to the start. Back to the life of Edison.

So Edison sold the rights to his new transmitter , to Western union for $ 100 , 000 which Thomas Edison: seemed like a ton of money. Um, but alas, it was kind of shortsighted for Edison. Telephones obviously became one of the most important technologies in the years to follow. And his receiver was actually widely used for the next 100 years. If you went and picked up a phone in the 1960s. It would have a carbon based transmitter based on Edison's patent. So he lost out on millions and millions of dollars by selling that patent to Western union. Uh, unfortunately, this was kind of typical for Addison. He was a really great inventor, obviously, but he was not a great businessman. He was. He was okay. I mean, he wasn't like a dunce, but he wasn't, he wasn't in the type of businessman that he wasn't inventor. Um, it was in the midst of working on this transmitter. The Edison made his first truly great world changing discovery. And it happened really late at night. Edison would have these great midnight work parties. Generally speaking, the environment at Menlo park was very professional, very buttoned up, and Workman like, but being the insane insomniac that he was, he would often make his men work very late with him and when he did, he would have the nightwatchman bring up a midnight dinner. The men could relax and converse. It was the one time that he kind of let their guard down and joke around, have a good time while they were at work. And then after they did this, after this midnight meal, the hours after midnight were often their most creative and led to some of their most productive experiments and big breakthroughs. And one night, shortly after their midnight dinner, Edison was testing out different materials for the diaphragm of the transmitter. And since he was hard of hearing, Edison had to hold his finger to the diaphragm to feel how much it was vibrating to see how well it was transmitting sound. Because again, you know, he couldn't really hear how well it was transmitting sound. As Edison was doing this, it kind of dawns on him like, Oh wait, this is making unique vibrations for each sound he makes. So he turns to his assistant Batchelor and says, batch, if we had a point on this, we could make a record on some material, which we could afterwards. Pull under the point and it would give us the speech back. So that's the way that recording works. Right? And he just kind of intuits this that, huh?

And he just kind of intuits this that , huh ? If Thomas Edison: my voice is making these vibrations, will then, if I could make these vibrations kind of solid, then in whatever way I record them, I could just reverse the process and make the sound again. And it's kind of like a big realization to have all at once. Right? But he does. So he calls his master machinist, a German man by the name of KUSI. And by the way, this guy and bachelor were geniuses, especially Colussy. He was an absolute savant at taking Edison's ideas and turning them into machines. And so Edison tells this machinists that they're going to try to do this, make an indent on some wax paper, and then pull it back through to see if the noise will reproduce. Uh, KUSI said, this is absurd, but Hey, you know, I'll try it. There's no way this is going to work. But sure. Whatever you say, mr Edison, it's a real statement to their adaptability and ability to move quickly, that they have an experiment rigged up and ready to try in just an hour or so. Naturaler pulled the wax paper along the wheel, and Edison spoke loudly into a telephone mouthpiece with a point attached to the back. and he used the stock phrase that they used for experiments such as this. He said, Mary had a little lamb. They pulled out the wax paper and examined it, saw the marks of the vibrations, and then put it back under the needle at the beginning and they pulled it along roughly the same speed and as they did, they heard Edison's voice saying Mary had a little lamb back to them. Crucey cried out my guts in hemo or in English, my God in heaven, it is like his mind is blown, right? Mascular would later say it was not fine talking, but the shape of it was there. There were cheers and congratulations all the way around. People can't believe it. They have imagine for the first time in history. Heard recorded human speech and it can be difficult to understand just how monumental this was. When Edison told his attorney Benjamin Butler about the invention, the ladder's response was my dear Edison. Tell me something more about your wonderful invention in recording the human voice.

He wrote , quote , you probably remember our experimentation about printing Thomas Edison: the human voice. I have not done that, but I have produced in recording the voice on a paper from which I can reproduce the same voice at any future time. As you can listen and recognize the voice of the original speaker. In speaking to the Philadelphia record, a newspaper, Edison's colleague, Edward Johnson, described it similarly. He said that Edison had invented an instrument quote by which a speech can be recorded while it is being delivered on prepared paper, and that it could be redelivered at any time. I mean, even by today's standards, that kind of sounds like magic. I can record a voice on paper and then make the paper repeat back the same voice and the people at the time, it was like magic. It was a complete sensation. It's difficult to put ourselves in their shoes because now we are so used to seeing and experiencing new technologies that were sort of jaded to it. I mean, what could be invented now that would truly blow your mind? What was the last invention that you saw it and were just like, Whoa, mouth agape. You couldn't believe what you are seeing or hearing. It's really rare these days. Right? I don't even know what could do that now to us. Maybe like a, a teleportation device or something like that. And that's kinda like what this was the people at the time. It really, it, it melted their brains. Uh, there are stories that they test the device with random strangers. They play it for people. And they ask them, what do you hear? And the people respond, I have no idea what this is. I don't know what I hear. And, you know, the audio was not as high quality as recorded audio, not as high quality as the audio that you're hearing right now. For me. But it was audible, right? But these people could not decipher the words, and then the person who was playing the audio for them would say, this is a recorded human voice that you're about to hear. And they would play it again. And the person could tell them, every word that the person had spoken is when they heard it the first time. Their brain could not compute.

It is a, it is crazy how much this invention blew their minds. How incomprehensible it was to them. In fact, after it was announced, one professor wrote to Edison asking him to repudiate what obviously must be a hoax. He said, quote, the idea of a talking machine is ridiculous, but the article is so ingeniously constructed that some persons are so ignorant of the first principles of science that they are apt to believe it. True. Unless you deny it. In other words, this scientist is asking Edison to repudiate reports of this talking machine. Cause obviously that's ridiculous. That could never happen. Despite these reactions. Edison doesn't immediately recognize how this might be commercialized. Notice that in his letter to his lawyer, he starts by saying, you remember our experimentation about printing the human voice? I have not done that. What Edison was trying to do was print human speech in order to make telegrams easier to send. Telephones had been invented, obviously, as we've discussed, but these were still being used as more reliable ways to send telegrams , rather than having to tap out messages and Morse code. You could call up the station agent and he would just write down the message as you've said it, and it would later be delivered to the intended recipient. Uh, in writing, right. He was trying to invent a way so that you could speak in the words, would simply type themselves out, automated voice transcription, essentially something that is still not totally reliable in 2020, uh, if you ever use voice transcription on your phone or something like that, you know, it makes lots of mistakes. So he felt like he had only solved half the problem. He had invented a way to record sound. But you could only play it back with sound. You couldn't automatically convert it to writing, which is what he was trying to do. Edison, in his colleagues, failed to anticipate the mass market appeal of their achievement. Um, they would really gain that perspective accidentally. and article in the scientific American reported breathlessly on the work of some French researchers who were attempting to record human speech, but they were attempting to do so by measuring the movement of the lips, tongue, mouth, larynx, and so on of, of the speaker, right? So they're trying to measure the way that your mouth and your throat is moving as you speak. And then they were going to try and use that", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/thomas-edison", "title": "Thomas Edison", "chunk_index": 16, "publication_date": "2020-04-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 53}}
{"text": "lips , tongue , mouth , larynx , and so on of , of the speaker , right ? So they ' re trying to measure the way that your mouth and your throat is moving as you speak . And then they were going to try and use that Thomas Edison: to create a robot that would do basically the same motions, you know, like artificial lips and stuff, uh, with an artificial throat that was like a pipe organ and they would recreate the sounds. Somewhere else. So, so you could speak, they would measure it. Then they would send that information across telegram and essentially a robot would recreate your speech on the other end. We know that this was not a reliable way to record and reproduce human speech. But at the time it seemed rather promising and impressive. The reporters of the scientific American, so they write an article about it saying that it's the bees knees. These friends researchers are really on the verge of remarkable breakthrough and soon they will be able to record and reproduce sound. How exciting is that? Well, Edward Johnson, who was kind of like Edison's chief marketing officer. Sees this and it really grinds his gears. Right? It really makes him mad that these guys are getting all this press for claiming to be on the verge of something the Edison had actually already accomplished. So with Edison's permission, he writes a letter to scientific American and basically says, Hey, we already recorded human speech and we can reproduce it at any time. And he sends a diagram of their as yet unnamed contraption, which would come to be known as the phonograph. This creates an international sensation and people's first reaction is essentially, wait, you're telling us that we can hear the voices of dead people? And that's kind of the first application that people make in their minds is that if we can record people's speech, then we will be able to hear them continue to talk after they are dead. Which tells you something about human nature right? And that doesn't seem so remarkable to us now, right? We're used to hearing the voices of Pass statesman, you've heard the voice of John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, and if you're an American, you've heard all of these actors and actresses from old time movies who are now dead. And that doesn't seem weird to us, but this was really remarkable. And I think one of the reasons why is that for thousands of years across many different places and cultures , soothsayers and magicians, fortune tellers had claimed to be able to speak for the dead via magical or divine powers. We have , for whatever reason, this , internal natural urge to connect with our loved ones who have died.

We have , for whatever reason , this , internal natural urge to connect with our loved ones who have died . And so Thomas Edison: that was like kind of a staple of magic. And now along comes this man who had made that promise real. We're going to be able to hear the voices of dead people from beyond the grave, if they record something before they die. no wonder he was soon given the nickname the wizard of Menlo park. A few short weeks later on December 7th, 1877, Edison and his colleagues walked into the offices of the scientific American to display a working model of the phonograph. Here's what scientific American wrote about what happened next. Mr. Thomas a Edison recently came into this office, placed a little machine on our desk, turned to crank in the machine, inquired as to our health, asked how we liked the phonograph, informed us that it was very well and bid us a cordial good night. These remarks were not only perfectly audible to ourselves, but to a dozen or more persons gathered around and they were produced by the aid of no other mechanism than the simple little contrivance explained and illustrated below. The photograph was obviously then diagrammed below in the article It was huge news all over the world and though he didn't realize it at the time, this Mark, the beginning of the end of Thomas Edison's life as a private person, he would be a celebrity for the rest of his life. Letters from the adoring public constantly streamed in. And eventually so did interested onlookers who crammed into public viewing areas in the Menlo park lab to catch a glimpse of the legend at work. Edison soon discovered that he was a natural showman. He was sort of Steve jobs like in his ability to get the press to report breathlessly on any new invention that he had made or even claimed to have made. In fact, Edison served as a direct inspiration for C jobs in 1984 when job's pulled the bag off the first Macintosh, it's first words mimic those of the phonograph. Hello, I am Macintosh. It sure is great to get out of that bag. So anyway, all this leads to a huge international profile and a big platform, but not huge profits. Addison would struggle to find a profitable use for the phonograph for quite a while, and everybody would, it would be decades before recorded audio found a use that many people would use in their homes and was widely available. Part of this was Edison's fault. He was an inveterate tinkerer. he just couldn't stop trying to perfect the machine . And just kinda get something done and ready for release.

{"text": "use in their homes and was widely available . Part of this was Edison ' s fault . He was an inveterate tinkerer . he just couldn ' t stop trying to perfect the machine . And just kinda get something done and ready for release . But part of Thomas Edison: it was also just the technical difficulties inherent in creating a useful product. Edward Johnson wrote quote, the phonograph is creating an immense stir, but I think it impresses people more as a toy than as a practical machine, which was definitely true. Around this time, the New York sun released an article titled a marvelous discovery, a man of 31 revolutionizing the whole world, and it was really a hagiography. It was the first of many articles that would portray Edison in an almost legendary light hued closely to an old American stereotype of this wild frontier inventor is first established by Benjamin Franklin about a hundred years earlier. Edison was portrayed as a plain-spoken, approachable, normal seeming man who nevertheless possessed and almost godlike ability to create technology that revolutionized human life out of thin air. He was usually portrayed as dirty and grinding with grease, chewing tobacco and speaking plain, unaffected language. And though Edison was definitely trying to portray a certain image, you know, he liked playing up this folksy inventor. Um, the appearance that was in these reports was for all intents and purposes. Correct. He did kind of look like that. Uh, he did love to chew tobacco or chomp on a cigar. He did in fact, do a lot of the work himself at this time and could often be found at the work bench with dirty shirt, greasy hands. Um, and he was often found in unkempt conditions because he had once again slept at the office. so he is kind of playing up his celebrity, but you know, it's based on, on a truth about who he really was. but this article spurs even more people to come and see him. Menlo park started to turn into a zoo where he's the main attraction, and at the same time, pressure is mounting from creditors and business associates to find more profitable uses for the phonograph. So Edison decides that he just needs to get away for awhile and takes a trip to the Western United States. He starts, uh, in Wyoming where he goes to observe a solar eclipse, and he then proceeds to go even further West to California before turning home, making a stop at st Louis on the way. When he gets back, he tells her porters that the trip was a lot of fun, but he hadn't come back with any ideas for new inventions. but less than 24 hours after returning, he made three sketches in his notebook and at the top of the page, he titled them electric light.

Thanks for listening. ‚Äç Hello and welcome to how to take over the world. This has been Wilson, and this episode is the second episode about Thomas Edison covering his life from the invention of electric light until his death. And I'm going to do something a little bit different. This go around. I'm going to do this episode two, and then next week I'm going to do something called end notes where I'm just going record sort of my thoughts that didn't fit neatly into the narrative that I laid out in part one and part two. Um, so it'll just be kind of some ramblings and some extra notes and. You guys can let me know what you think of that. But for this episode, where we're starting at is, if you remember, Edison invented the phonograph and then he went out West. He took this kind of big vacation and came back with ideas about electric light. Uh, this was in 1878. Addison is 31 years old, , and when Edison invented the phonograph and with it, the entire idea of recorded sound, it was basically by accident. If you remember, he was working on a different problem and it just kind of came to him all at once. And his invention of the light bulb could not have been more different. Electric light was something that dozens of people were working on. Everyone kind of knew it was the future. It was just that no one could really figure out how to make it work. And so when Edison starts working on perfecting the light bulb in 1878. It's the ultimate heat check. Dozens of other men with more impressive academic credentials than him had been working on it for years, and he thinks he can just come in and figure it out. No problem. Right now, it's important to keep in mind that a form of electric light actually already been invented by the time Edison came along. But it wasn't electric light like we know it. They had what were called arc lights. The first arc light was developed way back 20 years previous in 1855 and what it was is essentially a giant open current. So you got two big metal poles and there's a continuous electric current passing from one to the other. If you've ever seen a welder with one of those big heavy masks in their tools, throwing off this huge bright white", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/thomas-edison", "title": "Thomas Edison", "chunk_index": 20, "publication_date": "2020-04-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 53}}
{"text": "open current . So you got two big metal poles and there ' s a continuous electric current passing from one to the other . If you ' ve ever seen a welder with one of those big heavy masks in their tools , throwing off this huge bright white Thomas Edison: light that is actually called arc welding. And arc welding is essentially just using mini arc lights to fuse together metal. So that's really what an arc light is, right? But there's a problem with it. One is that they are incredibly dangerous, so you got to keep them far removed from pedestrians. The other problem is that they're incredibly bright. So with an ArcLight, the strategy is to put it way up high. And let a single arc light light a block, or even a few blocks. This creates problems because it casts horrible shadows. And also because you can't really use it for indoor lighting, it's, it's just too bright. and so these lights were sort of a novelty, but people were still looking for a better solution, something that they could actually replace candles and gas lamps with, which brings us to incandescent lighting. of course, as you probably know with incandescent lights, instead of using an open current as the light source, like an ArcLight, instead, you send a charge through a filament, heating it up until it starts to glow. and again, incandescent lighting had already been discovered far before Edison, at least in principle. But the problem in 1878 was finding a material for the filament of an incandescent bulb that would last for long enough to make it practical. Because if you imagine most things that you heat up so hot that they glow usually either melt or burst into flame. And even if you had a good substance that would not Mel or burst into flame, most of them would burn out after only a few minutes and a light bulb that needs to be replaced every five minutes is like, that's not practical, right? That's a science fair project. So everyone was trying to figure out how to make a practical incandescent light bulb that would last. And Edison was not lacking in self-confidence. He was certain that. He could succeed or others had failed. It seemed easy to him. In fact, so easy that he starts telling newspaper reporters that he has this thing figured out. He's got an incandescent light bulb invented. After only a few weeks of working on it. He comes up with this bulb and it's lasting longer than anyone else's, and he figures, Hey, that was easy.

It becomes huge news. They're reporting it in the New York times, reporting it in the papers all over the world. Edison has invented. The electric light bulb. And not only that, but Edison has a pretty fleshed out idea of how these new bulbs could be used to make electric light practical for millions of people. Listen to what he wrote, and remember, this is before any of this is invented. This is just Edison speculating off the top of his dome. In fact, they were still years away from, from anyone getting electric light. but here's what Addison wrote quote With the process. I have just discovered I can produce a thousand bulbs from one machine. Indeed, the number may be said to be infinite when the brilliancy and cheapness of the lights are made known to the public, which will be in a few weeks, or just as soon as I can thoroughly protect the process, illumination by gas will be discarded with 15 or 20 of these dynamic electric machines. I can light the entire lower part of New York city. Using a 500 horsepower engine. I propose to establish one of these light centers in Nassau street. Once wires can be run uptown, these wires must be insulated and laid in the ground in the same manner as gas pipes. I also propose to utilize the gas burners and chandelier's. Now in use in each house, I can place a light meter once these wires will pass through the house, tapping small metallic contrivances that may be placed over each burner . Whenever it is desired to light a jet, it will only be necessary to touch a little spring near it. No matches are required. again, the same wire that brings the light to you will also bring power and heat. with the power. You can run the elevator, a sewing machine or any other mechanical contrivance that requires a motor and by means of the heat, you may cook your food. so this seems like pretty simple stuff to us today because he's just describing a power grid. Yes. You flip a switch and you get light, or you get appliances, you can run a sewing machine, you can get heat through your electricity. But that was totally revolutionary at the time, right? Because there were no power grids. so in order to say this, Edison sort of had to imagine this future out of the void, and in order to make it", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/thomas-edison", "title": "Thomas Edison", "chunk_index": 22, "publication_date": "2020-04-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 53}}

Not only the light bulbs, but the generators, the wiring, the meters, the appliances, even the light switches. first, the key to this entire system of electric light, the first step that would unlock everything else and make it possible. Was finding a light bulb that could last, and Edison had a problem in this regard because the bulb that he had invented, the one he told all these reporters about and sent off a firestorm of publicity, it's a total and complete failure. He had gone down the wrong path. He was using a zinc and platinum construction, which is cleverly designed, but it doesn't last much longer than anyone else's bulb. It showed promising results at first, so he thought that if he kept tinkering with it, you know, he could, he could figure it out. He could get it to last longer. But no, uh, that, that particular road he was going down was a total dead end. And Edison is starting to realize that he's got absolutely nothing in terms of a light bulb, right? As the media attention is reaching a fever pitch. People are saying the Edison has struck gold twice in a row. He's invented the phonograph and now the light bulb and are shouting his praises. And everyone is so intrigued to see this new light bulb in action. And again, he's just realizing he's completely wrong. He's got nothing. It's not a great situation to be in. In fact, it's, it's so stressful that he has a complete nervous breakdown. Uh, he's bedridden for a week and a half with a horribly painful condition called facial neurology. Uh, but luckily there is one thing that he's got. And that's boatloads of money because the richest and most powerful men in the world were tripping over themselves to fund Edison's new venture in discovering electric light. the financier's that Edison actually goes with our men representing Western union and JP Morgan, they capitalize his new electric light company to the tune of $395,000. Which is the equivalent of about 10 point $5 million in 2020 money. He's well-funded, but he's on the hook. He has to invent the light bulb. Now he's got the eyes of the world on him.

And so Thomas Edison: Edison goes to the strategy that had always worked best for him. Which is to forget the clever theorizing and just experiment and tinker like crazy until he figured something out. So he staffs up and he and his team try out thousands of different substances to see what will work. and he continues these experiments over months and months with everyone pressuring him and waiting to see what he will come up with. Edison reportedly said during this time quote, I think there's no doubt. I am the busiest man in America. Which is true. He's got a group of workers that are referred to as the insomnia squad, and people refer to this bizarre situation that you'll visit the lab in Menlo park and it looks like, like a homeless shelter. There are just people fully clothed, sleeping all over the place, under benches, under tables in random corners and closets. And that's because Edison was completely obsessed with figuring this out. He had all the pressure of the world on his shoulders, and he expected his employees to feel the same way about it that he did. So there was no regular sleep schedules. You came into the lab, you worked on finding a working light bulb until your body just couldn't take it anymore, at which point you curled up and grabbed an hour or two of Shaddai under some bench somewhere, and then you got back to work. There were no other priorities and there were no distractions. Well, actually there was one minor distraction for Edison when a minor scientist by the name of Clarence Blake. Gives a lecture in which he pays tribute to Alexander Graham bell for inventing the telephone without mentioning Edison. Edison goes berserk. He considered himself essential to the creation of the telephone because of the transmitter that he had invented, and it was a really big deal. It made the telephone much more usable over much longer distances. And so Edison kind of had a point when he said that he was one of the fathers of the telephone. So for someone to give a big public speech . Where they only mentioned bell as the sole inventor of the telephone that insulted Edison, and he felt slighted. So when one of Edison's European agents, a guy by the name of George Guerard sends Edison a letter saying, you know what? We need. Is a better receiver for the telephone. Edison jumps at the chance. He takes a couple months away from the light bulb and invents a new chalk receiver that makes a telephone much more functional and capable of receiving messages from far greater", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/thomas-edison", "title": "Thomas Edison", "chunk_index": 24, "publication_date": "2020-04-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 53}}

He takes a couple months away from the light bulb and invents a new chalk receiver that makes a telephone much more functional and capable of receiving messages from far greater Thomas Edison: distances. It's a monumental achievement, a stunning success in a very short period of time, and he doesn't just as a sideshow, and then he's right back to the light bulb. And to me, this is kind of like, this is peak Edison. This is him at his powers where he's inventing stuff just to stunt on people, just to show them that he can, you know, he's, he's inventing world changing inventions just to solve petty slights, but despite this, the light bulb is still actually not going that great and the news is starting to get out that things are not going well. 14 of the 16 patents that he submitted to the us patent office are rejected as unworkable in the newspapers, who just months ago were reporting that he had solved the problem of the light bulb are now reporting. The Edison actually has no idea what he's doing, . And it's not just the press who are coming after Edison. The scientific community always had a particular hatred for him because he was a highly successful inventor and scientist despite having virtually no formal education, and so they were launching a bunch of invective against him. In one case, Edison had invented a new dynamo, which is an early form of like generator to generate power for his light bulbs. And it was weird looking. It was kind of clunky and awkward. And, um, unlike anything else that had been invented in terms of dynamo, it didn't look like a, a good functioning dynamo and the scientific community, just Savage, this new machine, they're brutal in criticizing it. The Irish physicist and academic John Tyndall said about it, quote, it is difficult adequately to express the ludicrous inefficiency of the arrangement, but one thing is abundantly certain, and that is that the person who seriously proposed it was wholly destitute of a scientific knowledge of either electricity or the science of energy. so it's not what you want people to be saying. But meanwhile, I mean, Edison actually tries to thing and it generates so much energy that it breaks the coils that get hooked up to it. it's a very raw invention. It needed a bunch of modifications to become practical, but it was a breakthrough in generator design and academics and theoretical scientists just don't give it the time of day. They're totally dismissive and condescending, and this would be one of the inciting incidents, you know, long feud with the academic and scientific establishment.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/thomas-edison", "title": "Thomas Edison", "chunk_index": 25, "publication_date": "2020-04-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 53}}

They ' re totally dismissive and condescending , and this would be one of the inciting incidents , you know , long feud with the academic and scientific establishment . Thomas Edison: They generally refuse to give Edison much respect. And he always had some nasty words for what he considered do nothing academics who never actually did or invented anything and only ever criticized those who actually did get out there and invent things. Edison has quotes. He says things like, take a whole pile of theoretical scientists that I can name and you will find uncertainty if not in position in half of what they state as scientific truth. and with this already, you can definitely see his perspective why he would feel this way. Well, in the midst of all this pressure and skepticism from the press and infected from the scientific establishment, Edison finally does have his breakthrough with the light bulb on Tuesday, October 21st. Edison had his lab assistants test a bulb with a carbonized filament using lamp black and either thread or a fishing line. The light lasted for 13 and a half hours. Edison wrote Eureka in his laboratory log book. Now, you probably wouldn't buy a light bulb that was going to last for just 13 and a half hours, but it was enough to demonstrate that, Hey, we're onto something here. We can build on this. And sure enough, two months later, by new year's Eve, they have 59 reliable lamps to show off at Menlo park. With bulbs that can last for over 600 hours. They throw a great big party, and it's really the arrival of the electric light bulb. I mentioned this party because it's at this party that Edison has. One of my favorite quotes, um, at the party, someone asks Edison if he is a genius and he responds. You know well enough, I am nothing of the sort unless we accept the theory. The genius is prolonged patients. I'm patient enough to be sure, and I would just like to point out that that that kind of actually is exactly what genius is. Prolonged patients, a good amount of intelligence married to an unfailing energy and level of effort. , you may have heard the other saying genius is 1% inspiration, 99% perspiration. And it sounds kind of corny, but that is actually a Thomas Edison quote. And if you can kind of remove the cliche aura around it, I think it's, it tells you a lot about what it takes to do something great about genius and about who Edison was.

{"text": "you a lot about what it takes to do something great about genius and about who Edison was . Now I ' d just like to take a second to talk about the nature of this discovery , because on its surface , it isn ' t this earth shattering Thomas Edison: thing. It isn't this breakthrough. It didn't blow people's minds in quite the same way that recorded sounded. And that's because Edison didn't strictly invent electric light or even the incandescent light bulb. So you'll see some people out there who say, Oh, you know, Edison was a fraud, and a greedy businessman who really just stole his inventions from other people and claim them as his own, which is a nice story, right? It fits a certain narrative of the greedy capitalist, but it's just not remotely true. Edison absolutely deserves credit for inventing the light bulb. Yes. Other people made other important contributions in the field. But who deserves credit? I mean, on October 21st, 1882, no one had electric light, uh, basically, , and after that date, they were on the road, , to that becoming a reality and to giving electric light to millions of people. So when people try to claim the Edison doesn't deserve credit for the light bulb and for electric light, I think of the line from the movie, the social network. When Mark Zuckerberg says. If you guys were the inventors of Facebook, you'd have invented Facebook. I just, I feel that way about the light bulb. If someone else had invented the light bulb, they would have invented the light bulb, and these claims are not new. People at the time tried to downplay his achievements or even downright denied them, especially members of the academic and scientific community. As I was mentioning earlier, when Edison applied for patents in London. His lamp was dismissed as, quote, a hopeless failure, wrong in design, wrong in principle, useful only in showing how singularly devoid of sound, scientific knowledge, a clever practical man might be. I mean, that's above and beyond what is necessary to shoot down what they thought was a failed Bible. Right. And add to that, that they were wrong. It was working. Um, the Frenchman, Dumont cell, they're our greatest scientists on the subject of electric light. Said that all should regardless suspicion, the pompous announcements that come our way from the new world and even in America. Professor Henry Morton, president of the Stevens Institute of technology called Edison's bulb, a conspicuous failure. All of these experts claim that the incandescence of Edison's light bulb.

{"text": "Stevens Institute of technology called Edison ' s bulb , a conspicuous failure . All of these experts claim that the incandescence of Edison ' s light bulb . Was clearly fake and sure to burnout after a few hours if only given closer inspection and an honest test , Thomas Edison: and you can't blame them too much. I mean, Edison is the same guy who was claiming that he had invented the light bulb years ago, so his claim probably did deserve some skepticism, but the condescension was over the top. And of course they were wrong. He had figured it out. Edison referred to electric light as the greatest adventure of my life, akin to venturing on an uncharted sea. And even after the invention of the light bulb, that adventure was just starting out. A light bulb is just a bulb, and if you have nothing to plug it into, it's not going to do you much. Good. So Edison and his company had already started working on things like generators and a delivery system, but now they really kicked into high gear working on these things. The number of patents that Edison and his team submit during this time period is staggering. They're coming up with and patenting dynamos and engines to create energy wires to transport the electricity systems for laying out and distributing it. Lamps, bulbs, and appliances that can be used with it. Safety fuses and centrifical governors to control the running of motors as demand Rose and fell meters to measure the usage of electricity and more . At this point in his career, Edison was receiving a new patent roughly once every four days, which is just mind boggling. Again, inventing the light bulb was a monumental task, something no one else had been able to achieve, but developing everything else around it to deliver power to people's homes was no less of an achievement. In fact, it's probably a, an even bigger achievement, and it required an enormous amount of intelligence and ingenuity, not just from Edison, but from his team as well. He definitely didn't do it all himself. Crucey who you'll remember as Edison's brilliant machinist from last episode was really crucial in developing the insulated copper wiring that would transport energy to homes all over the world. Crucey also basically invented the grid prior to his invention. Edison's idea was to send out energy, like a tree branching off into smaller and smaller wires as it gets closer to individual homes. Well, Crucey comes up with a grid system that reduced the need for copper by seven eights and really made electric light economical. It was a really elegant, really efficient invention So it definitely wasn't a one man show. But at the same time, I think Edison deserves a lot of the credit for the accomplishments of his subordinates.

But at the same time , I think Edison deserves a lot of the credit for the accomplishments of his subordinates . He did Thomas Edison: a lot to push them and guide them towards solutions. He was a great, not just an inventor, but leader. This was expressed well by one of his junior electrical engineers who had joined the company. A couple years later. He said, quote, the effect that Edison produced on me was rather extraordinary when I saw this wonderful man who had no training at all, no advantages, and did it all himself. And saw the great results by virtue of his industry and application. I felt mortified that I had squandered my life. So, you know, this young engineer felt really inspired by seeing how much Edison could do and felt inspired himself to try and, you know, try and match that. and so in case you didn't guess that young engineer who was working for mr Edison was a guy by the name of Nikola Tesla. Uh, I'll get into their relationship. They're supposed rivalry and some of their similarities and differences in a separate episode because I think it merits a longer conversation. . Although I will just say here that the idea of a rivalry between the two of them is sort of overblown. But even with the assistance of this big team of brilliant engineers who assisted Edison. The whole electrifying a city for the first time thing took a lot of effort and it took a long time, two years later, they still hadn't installed anything. And people start to get anxious naturally, you know, Hey, when are we actually going to get electric power? And especially the finance ears are like, okay, wintering to start seeing a return on this capital. One of the big obstacles was getting the approval of corrupt New York city officials. So Edison comes up with a pretty brilliant plan. He gets chief alderman, John C. Morris, and other New York city officials. To come to Menlo park where Edison gives them a long lecture during which they start to get a little annoyed and very hungry and then he leads them upstairs to a pitch black room as they stand there waiting in this dark room, soft golden electric lights slowly come on, revealing an extravagantly set dinner table. And white gloved waiters standing at attention the wine and the bourbon flowed. And by the end of the night, John C. Morris was telling the table the Edison was entitled to the thanks of the world for bringing this light to such perfection that it can now be made to take the place of gas and assuring everyone that he was now an advocate of electric light.

You could count on him . Thomas Edison: the next day. Addison had a permit to bring incandescent electric light to 51 blocks of downtown Manhattan. Around this time, Edison decides that he can't really afford to be way out in Menlo park. So he moves his family up to New York city and establishes a new operating base and starts work , on a power plant facility on Pearl street. He also establishes a new company. He wanted to manufacture all of his own machinery, but his board of getting into manufacturing. So he starts to, Edison machine works as a separate company, which turned out to be a pretty good call as that little company would go on to become what we know as general electric, which was a pretty big deal for quite a long time. Edison was juggling all these different constraints, inventing and patenting the technology, building and manufacturing, all the different components necessary for all this to finally happen, but delay after delay piled up. and then finally on Monday, September 4th, 1882. Edison turned the lights on on New York city. He actually has them turned on at 3:00 PM so that no one would notice if they didn't work. But by 7:00 PM people start becoming aware, Whoa, wait, the electric lights are on all over the city. It was a total transformational moment in the history of the world. But it was also a little anticlimactic. There were a few news reports about it. No parties, no celebrations, just steady, practical, warm light. But it was enough for Edison who said, quote, I have accomplished all that I promised. Now, Edison has a really, really packed life. He invented a lot and did a lot over a long period of time. Um, none of it probably matches the Heights of inventing the phonograph and the electric light. So I'm gonna do sort of a quick overview of the rest of his life before going back and diving deep on a few stories. Things started to go really well for Edison's electric business, but then in 1884 he had the worst year of his life, a giant financial crisis hits the U S and sinks him into debt, and around the same time his wife dies at the time, no one could, or no one would say what exactly it was that she died from. But in retrospect, it's pretty clear that she sadly died of a morphine overdose over the next couple of years.

Edison managed to pull himself out of financial crisis , and by 1886 he ' s in a really Thomas Edison: good situation with more than 300,000 lamps in his circuit and booming revenue and profits. He also remarried in 1886 to a woman by the name of Mina Miller, and it's a great year for him. Business is doing well. He's in love, he's teaming with invented energy and even has time to patent an important non-electric light invention, the phone of Lex, but there's something else that happens in 1886 that should have concerned him on November 2nd a patent was filed for alternating current electricity, which would allow power to be sent over distances, far longer than Edison's direct current system and at power levels that were much higher. Despite these advantages, Edison decides not to take advantage of AC power. He said this was because AC was dangerous and could kill people. which to be fair to Edison was true. AC was in fact much more dangerous than DC. But it didn't matter all that much. The people, when it provided much more benefit for far cheaper than his DC electric light, the Westinghouse company with Nikola Tesla, who had left Edison as one of its chief engineers, takes up the mantle of AC power. And acquires the rights to it in the United States. By the end of 1888 Westinghouse is crushing Edison electric in terms of subscribers. At the same time, Edison nearly bankrupts himself again by putting money into an improved phonograph business. In the late 1880s Edison starts to put more and more control of his existing business into the hands of professional managers so that he can focus more time on inventing. Consequently, in the late 1880s Edison makes integral contributions to the development of moving pictures, but we now call cinema or movies. And in 1892 Edison is forced out as the director of his electric light company and decides to go into of all things mining. He establishes this enormous mine called the Ogden mine in New Jersey and develops all these crazy mining and refining technologies to try and make this mind competitive, even though the aura at this location was significantly less pure , than other mines in the United States. He keeps selling off ownership of his other companies, especially general electric, in order to fund this mining operation, which is crazy. He's just sinking good money after bad for this reason.

There's basically a small group of millionaires and billionaires, , most famously Samuel Insull, but Edison isn't one of them.

There ' s basically a small group of millionaires and billionaires , , most famously Samuel Insull , but Edison isn ' t one of them . He keeps pouring money from his profitable businesses into Thomas Edison: his unprofitable ones. Edison was never really poor during his life, but he was never rich either. He was basically always a minor millionaire. Whenever he achieved a ton of success, he poured a bunch of money from that into these new ventures where he could tinker and invent new things, but then often lost a bunch of money for him. , and that's because for Edison, money was never the point. You might remember from the last episode that he was literally addicted to inventing like a junkie who only makes money in order to buy more drugs. Edison only made money to pour it back into unprofitable ventures where he could invent new things. And so his mining business is just a total money pit. He's losing astronomical amounts of money, but he just keeps pouring more and more money into it. Until he literally can't lose anymore. He basically hits rock bottom and people refuse to fund the mine anymore. Despite this, he never really cared. He was never bitter about the mine. In fact, he had the time of his life. He was inventing cool new mining equipment and would later write quote. I never felt better in my life. Hard work, nothing to divert my thought. Clear air, simple food. It was very pleasant. On a return visit to the mine after it had failed, he was able to cheerfully joke, I put $3 million down that hole in the ground and never heard it hit bottom after he leaves the mine, he comes back and partially resumed control. Off phonograph, electric light, and moving picture businesses over the years. He also makes important new inventions in the areas of cement, manufacturing, x-ray technology, and most profitably with the development of rechargeable batteries. These were used in cars, submarines, and dozens of other uses. Speaking of car batteries, one of the most productive relationships of Edison's life came with a young engineer who worked for him early in his career. The young man named Henry Ford expressed to Edison a desire to keep tinkering on combustion engines, which Edison encouraged. Addison and Ford struck up a strong relationship that would last Edison's lifetime. And Ford really, really looked up to and admired Edison and continued to fund some of his less profitable ventures. Even when Ford kind of knew that, that he was probably not going to see a return on these investments. He just really, you know, admired Edison as like , the Saint Louis father of invention who gave him his start and would do anything for", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/thomas-edison", "title": "Thomas Edison", "chunk_index": 32, "publication_date": "2020-04-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 53}}

He just really , you know , admired Edison as like , the Saint Louis father of invention who gave him his start and would do anything for Thomas Edison: him. So it was a very productive relationship for both of them in different ways toward the end of his life. Edison spent time trying to come up with inventions for the U S Navy, but none of them were ever implemented, after that, the last major initiative of Edison's life, which he undertook in his late seventies and early eighties was trying to find a domestic source of rubber in the United States, but he wasn't able to complete that work before he died. During his lifetime, Edison invented the phonograph, the practical light bulb, the rechargeable nickel battery. The kinetoscope, the electric pen, the electric stock ticker, the underwater microphone, the fluoroscope, and he was a key innovator in mining motion pictures, cement and chemical manufacturing, telepany and telegraphy. He also founded one of the great American companies of the 20th century general electric and established many other crucial international companies. That brought light and electricity to millions. He did this despite growing up in obscure circumstances with no formal education and a disability deafness that he never made a big deal about and hardly ever mentioned. To me, the biggest lesson of Edison's life is finding something that you are passionate about. The way he was passionate about inventing. This is a little bit different from doing what you love. As people say. In a subtle but important way. I'm reminded of one of my favorite quotes from my favorite TV show, a show called Patriot. Where one of the lead characters says, quote, you are what you can't stop doing. What that means is if we discover what someone is passionate about. Then that person and that thing will intersect. Passion involves compulsion. people and what they love don't always intersect. People in their compulsion's do. So if you're trying to be successful, lean into doing what you feel compelled to do because if you do, it's like a superpower. You can overcome any obstacle, deal with any setback. None of it matters because you get to wake up every morning. And do the thing that you are compelled to do, the thing that you are borderline addicted to. So, for example, in 1914 an enormous fire swept through Edison's laboratories and manufacturing plants in New Jersey, damaging or destroying more than half the buildings and doing millions of dollars in damage, really destroying his company. He could only watch as the fire spread from building to building each new chemical or material that burned being set apart by a different color of", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/thomas-edison", "title": "Thomas Edison", "chunk_index": 33, "publication_date": "2020-04-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 53}}

He could only watch as the fire spread from building to building each new chemical or material that burned being set apart by a different color of Thomas Edison: fire. And so what was Edison's response to this total catastrophe that destroyed his business? He pulled aside his son and said, quote, get your mother and her friends over here. They'll never see a fire like this again. And when someone from the advertising department said, mr Edison, this is an awful catastrophe for you. He responded, yes. Maxwell a big fortune has gone up in flames tonight. But isn't it a beautiful site? One other story that I found highly instructive about Edison came from a lunch he had with Henry Ford and a man by the name of Daniels. It's very bizarre, but here is what Daniels wrote and keep in mind. This happened with Edison was in his late sixties. Daniels wrote quote, I do not suppose anything so strange ever occur to the luncheon in New York and elsewhere. After the first course, Edison pointing to a large chandelier with many gloves in the middle of the room said, Henry, I'll bet anything you want that I can kick the globe off. That chandelier hung high toward the ceiling. Ford said he would take the bet. Addison Rose pushed the table to one side of the room, took his stand in the center. And with his eye fixed on the globe, made the highest kick I have ever seen a man make and smash the globe into smithereens. He then said, Henry, let's see what you can do. The automobile manufacturer took careful, lame, but his foot missed the chandelier by a fraction of an inch. Edison had one, and for the balance of the meal or until the ice cream was served. He was crowing over Ford. You are a younger man than I am, but I can out kick you. He seemed prouder of that high tech than if he had invented a means of ending the U boat warfare. And that last sentence is a reference to something he was working on during world war one during the time of the story. So does that story remind you of anyone I know who it reminds me of? Admittedly, I've just been watching some of the last dance on ESPN, but it sounds just like Michael Jordan to me, getting way too competitive over totally small and meaningless stuff, but like MJ, Edison had this compulsion to win, to be the man in charge.

I'd like to finish up with two last stories from his life. You know, I like to draw comparisons between people on this podcast. so, I particularly enjoyed this little anecdote. a journalist asked Edison, whose voice out of all the people in history he most would have liked to have heard? Napoleon Edison replied. Instantly, the journalist responded in her approving tone. Well, the voice I should most like to have heard is that of our savior. Edison thought for a moment and said, well, you know, I like a hustler. The last story I want to share comes from the very end of Edison's life. Just two years before his death, he was getting old and finally slowing down. It was the 50th anniversary of his incandescent light bulb and a huge international celebration was planned. as part of it. Henry Ford had the entire lab complex from Menlo park, which was long since abandoned dissembled and put back together in Dearborn, Michigan. As essentially a museum. Ford had Edison's old lab completely restored to exactly how it looked when he invented the light bulb. He even went so far as to track down the old chemical manufacturers who had stocked his lab so that he could have the shelf stock with the exact same chemicals. And materials as Edison had had at the time. He also excavated the top foot of soil from Menlo park and had it shipped out so the old laboratory could even sit on top of the same soil as it had when the 80 year old Edison entered his old lab. It took his breath away. Where do you suppose they got them all? He asked, they're all here. Every one of the chemicals I had at Menlo park. He paced around for a few minutes and then sat down at a work bench with tears in his eyes. He said, I could sit right down here and go to work with my old tools. He attended a party and gave a speech later that night, but in the morning he was uncharacteristically exhausted. The exhausted old man needed arrest. He turned to his assistance and said. I'm tired of all this glory. I want to get back to work. thank you for listening to this episode of how to take over the world next week.

A little more relaxed, a little more loose , where this came from was I was looking at all of my notes that I had written for the Thomas Edison episodes, and I realized that I had about 60 pages of notes and I had written. And I had used about 30 of them for the two episodes, which meant I had nearly half of my work go unused. So I thought to myself, why not use that in some form or fashion? So these are notes. This is stuff about Edison that didn't really neatly fit into the narrative, but I still thought was interesting. So it's going to not have the same structural flow. It's not necessarily going to follow his life in chronological order. It's literally just kind of a. A stream of consciousness of some things that I thought as I was studying the life of Thomas Edison. So before we dive into all that, let's take a quick break to hear from our sponsor. So I wanted to start off talking about what is by far one of Edison's most underrated inventions. And that is the word hello. , if you think I'm joking, I'm not, I double and triple check this just cause it seems so unbelievable to me. Um, but it's true. Thomas Edison invented what is now one of the most fundamental words in English language. Before Thomas Edison, when people saw each other, they would say, greetings, good day, salutations. I don't know. They said other things, they generally did not say hello. It did exist as a word.

{"text": "English language . Before Thomas Edison , when people saw each other , they would say , greetings , good day , salutations . I don ' t know . They said other things , they generally did not say hello . It did exist as a word . It Thomas Edison: was pronounced differently. It was pronounced usually halloo and it was usually used as an expression of surprise. So, uh, you can hear that still sometimes. That's someone I don't know. For whatever reason, I think of it in a British accent, someone saying hello, you know, like they get surprised by something. And that was the way that this word, Hulu was used as an expression of surprise. , but then in the old, old days of telephones, when they were essentially still used as a tool for Telegraph operators. They needed a way to, get each other's attention because they didn't have ringers yet. So really they just had open lines between Telegraph stations. So if you needed to get in contact with someone, you just shouted. And so they needed something to shout. Alexander Graham bell suggested the word, uh, Hawaii. it's, I would love to live in the alternate universe where that becomes the standard greeting between people. But Edison suggested that they use this word Hulu, but that was, you know, the vowels are kind of soft. It didn't carry that well, so he changed the vowels to. Hello, because you can shout that really easily and be heard really easily. So Telegraph operators start using this when they want to be heard from station to station. So, Hey, I've got a message for someone. I pick up the telephone and I yell, hello, hello, until someone picks up. And then I give them the message. Of course, when telephones made their way to the general population, then people started using that in their homes when they picked up the telephone. Hello. And then it just made its way into the language as the default greeting. Hello. and so that word traces its roots directly back to Thomas Edison. I think that's just indicative of the way that Edison has had a huge impact on all of our lives in a way that we don't necessarily think about and we often take for granted. Okay. Let's talk really quickly about the Edison versus Tesla angle. Uh, something I've received a lot of questions about. As I mentioned in the last episode, a Tesla started working for Edison in 1884. He got right to work on a problem on a dynamo, on a boat. The Edison had been having a lot of problems with, and he stays up all night and he's able to figure out the problem and solve", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/thomas-edison", "title": "Thomas Edison", "chunk_index": 37, "publication_date": "2020-04-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 53}}
{"text": "for Edison in 1884 . He got right to work on a problem on a dynamo , on a boat . The Edison had been having a lot of problems with , and he stays up all night and he ' s able to figure out the problem and solve Thomas Edison: it. Edison supposedly remarks the bachelor. This is a damn good man. Uh, so he had good things to say about him. Then he had good things to say about him throughout his career. They respected each other as geniuses. Of course. Tesla was very inspired by Edison, as you might recall from last episode. They did have a falling out when Tesla stopped working for Edison. There's a disagreement about money. , essentially Tesla thought that Edison had promised him $50,000. Tesla is this new immigrant and he's just off the boat. He goes in for his first meeting with Edison and you know, they're talking about stuff. And Tesla says, well, what happens if, if I invent something that even you can't invent? And Edison goes, look, buddy, if you can invent something that I can't event, you can have $50,000 edison is joking. He, you know, he was not flush with cash at this time. He didn't have $50,000 to give, but Tesla is a very recent immigrant. His English is not great and he doesn't get the joke right. He thinks that Edison is serious. All he hears us. Well, I invent something that Edison. Can't then, uh, or hasn't, then I get $50,000. So when he does, uh, cause he, you know, he's a genius himself. He invented something that Edison didn't invent. He goes and says, where are my $50,000? And Edison says, you know, There are no $50,000. That was a joke. And a Tesla leaves in a Huff. But, uh, they, they didn't exactly reconcile. They were never like friends, but they were cordial throughout their careers. And I think Tesla came to understand that Edison wasn't serious and he had misinterpreted this because Tesla did have kind things to say about Edison, uh, which you wouldn't expect if he felt like he was truly ripped off by a dishonest man. They did have tremendously different approaches, which they talked about sometimes, and look, they were rivals. They were both competitive guys who took a lot of pride in their work. Pestle said of his approach. I did not need any models nor drawings or experiments. I could do it all in my mind.

{"text": "guys who took a lot of pride in their work . Pestle said of his approach . I did not need any models nor drawings or experiments . I could do it all in my mind . The way I unconsciously developed a new method of for materializing inventions and Thomas Edison: ideas is exactly the opposite of the purely experimental method of which undoubtedly Edison is the greatest and most successful exponent. I liked one quote that described their differences. let's say, quote, Tesla's was a more original genius than Edison. He surrounds himself with a halo of electric light and calls purple streams from the soil. His aim is to hook man's machinery directly to natures. And, , I think that statement that Tesla's was a more original genius than Edison, , is, is certainly accurate from a certain viewpoint. I think Tesla was probably smarter from a pure IQ horsepower standpoint than Edison was. But, you know, obviously Edison had the more successful career, had more inventions. which is why I always say the energy and work ethic matter more than intelligence in the long run. I also think that Edison's approach, which was this experimental method, rather than Tesla's more theoretical way of doing things is a better approach. And I think that's another reason why Edison had more success, despite probably on an objective level, being less intelligent than Tesla was. I think one thing that kind of demonstrates the difference between them is an incident in 1895 Nikola Tesla saw his entire lab burned down. , much as you'll remember, Edison did. And, um Edison was very about seeing his, uh, lab burden down. Tesla was not, , he said, and I quote, I am in too much grief to talk, what can I say? The work of half my lifetime, very nearly all my mechanical instruments and scientific apparatus, everything has gone. I must begin over again. , so you can see from that that Tesla, even though he was this genius, probably didn't have quite the same grit and determination that Edison did. Not quite, he did start over again. And so I would say he did have a lot of that. But you know, Edison was sort of extraordinary in that regard. And, uh, to speak to their relationship a little bit. Uh, Tesla also said after this, you know, great fired his lab quote I ever received a letter from mr Edison offering me the use of his workshop in which to continue my experiments. He has shown me the greatest kindness and consideration. I do not think, however, that I will accept the offer. So anyway, it was sort of a, it was a competitive, but you know, also sort of friendly relationship. I like to think of it as", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/thomas-edison", "title": "Thomas Edison", "chunk_index": 39, "publication_date": "2020-04-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 53}}
{"text": "greatest kindness and consideration . I do not think , however , that I will accept the offer . So anyway , it was sort of a , it was a competitive , but you know , also sort of friendly relationship . I like to think of it as Thomas Edison: like professor X and Magneto or something like that. Speaking of Tesla, I find it hilarious that Elon Musk named his company Tesla because Elan is so much like Edison, , in big ways and in like funny little ways as well. Both spent time in Canada in their teenage years. But then became successes in the United States. , both are known for their tireless work effort and a demanding leadership style. Both are known for wanting to control every aspect of sourcing and manufacturing. Both made meaningful contributions to battery technology. One of Edison's biggest dreams actually that he never got to see through was he wanted to create an electric car, a mass market, electric car. Uh, of course, Elon did popularize the electric car. both are definitely experimentalists. Um, rather than, you know, theoretical guys. the story about Elon that reminds me most of Edison was when Elan started the boring company. I don't know if you've heard this, but the boring company is Elan's company for. Digging tunnels. Uh, he, one day has to go into work and is just so frustrated by the traffic in Los Angeles where his company is based. And so he decides, you know, it'd be logical rather than having to meet with all this traffic, just having tunnels so that we could go underground and, and avoid all that traffic. So what does Elon do when he has this idea? He starts the boring company and literally just starts digging a hole in the parking lot and then starts digging and digging, and then they start digging over and they just kind of, as they go, start figuring out better and better technology for digging these holes and digging these tunnels. And that's kind of how Edison would do it too. You know? First just start experimenting, start figuring it out, and eventually you'll figure it out rather than, you know, sit down with some textbooks and try and figure it out. From a theoretical standpoint, what would be best. It also, there's similarities. Uh, get down to smaller stuff too. Uh, you know, I mentioned their time in Canada also, you know, in contrast to Tesla's very well known celibacy, both Edison and Ilan have had multiple children by multiple women. Uh, both even kind of look alike if you ask me. So anyway, I thought the similarities are too much. I'm sure someone has to have asked you on about it. Right. And so I", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/thomas-edison", "title": "Thomas Edison", "chunk_index": 40, "publication_date": "2020-04-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 53}}
{"text": "had multiple children by multiple women . Uh , both even kind of look alike if you ask me . So anyway , I thought the similarities are too much . I ' m sure someone has to have asked you on about it . Right . And so I Thomas Edison: went Googling, I looked, and sure enough, Elon did an interview, and here's what he had to say about his relationship to Edison. In an interview, so there you go. I do think that Elon is probably the closest living thing that we have to Edison. , and you know, he acknowledges that he, he takes some inspiration from, from Edison's life, which is not surprising to me. Speaking of comparisons, uh, obviously another easy comparison to make is with Steve jobs. both had a propensity for starving themselves and for weird diets, Steve jobs would have periods of his life where he would only eat apples. And Edison had a period in his life where he would only drink milk. That's the only food or drink that he would consume. Uh, so that's again, kind of a. A weird similarity between the two. They also had this flair for showmanship. that was very akin. and then, , another connection that I just think is funny is that, you know, Edison did not invent, but he did perfect the telephone. And similarly, Steve jobs did not invent the smartphone, but he kind of perfected it and made it this new mass market thing with a, with the iPhone. And when Steve jobs introduced the iPhone, he did so with a commercial call. What else? Hello? . This commercial featured famous movie moments where people answer a phone and say hello, and then it shows the iPhone and just says hello on the screen. And I'm sure that it was unintentional to pay tribute to a word that Edison invented, but I find that meaningful in a cosmic sort of way that he did kind of accidentally pay tribute to Edison. Okay. Uh, other notes. Um, okay. So Edison was like a classic mad scientist. He was always blowing himself up, poisoning himself. he nearly killed himself all the time. So, uh, he nearly choked himself on poison gas. He nearly radiated himself to death with x-rays. He nearly blinded himself by staring at lights. He electrocuted himself multiple times. He set himself on fire, burned himself with acid. He held things that blew up in his hands, including tons and tons of light bulbs. Um, in fact, it's my conspiracy theory that he probably made himself death with an experiment gone wrong. you know, the famous quote that he had about when he went deaf is he said that he hadn't heard a bird chirp since he was", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/thomas-edison", "title": "Thomas Edison", "chunk_index": 41, "publication_date": "2020-04-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 53}}
{"text": "in fact , it ' s my conspiracy theory that he probably made himself death with an experiment gone wrong . you know , the famous quote that he had about when he went deaf is he said that he hadn ' t heard a bird chirp since he was Thomas Edison: 12. And I find it odd that he targeted it to that exact date in the story about what did make him death, um, was kind of always changing, right? There there, there is no good answer. Uh, different diseases, different conditions were put forth and Edison himself said different things. but you know, he said, I haven't heard a bird chirp since I was 12 years old, and that's right when he was starting to get all these chemistry experiments and experiment in his basement, and there are reports, he said his mother said that he blew out the windows in the basement multiple times. He was always blowing stuff up. and, and blowing out the windows. And of course that's what he did on the train that got him kicked off the train. So it's my, I think it's kind of a conspiracy theory, I guess. Uh, cause I haven't heard anyone else say this, but I think it's possible that he at least made his deafness worse by blowing out his eardrums in an experiment, uh, when he was a young boy when he was 12 or 13 years old. , so there you go. But I just find it funny that, uh, he was like this classic mad scientist who was nearly always killing himself. His hair was always, you know, singed and standing on end. And, uh, he was that like classic mad scientist experimenting, blowing stuff up. Some of my favorite quotes that I didn't get to put in a famous Edison quote that he would say all the time is all things come to him who hustles while he waits. Uh, which I think is something good to remember. All things come to him who hustles while he waits quote from someone else. Uh, an MP from Ireland named TP O'Connor. Said quote, he's like a great school boy. The simplicity of genius was never before so remarkably illustrated, and I like that. The simplicity of genius, and I like to think about that. Sometimes the genius does not come from being involved in all of these things and being able to be everyone everywhere. No genius comes from simplicity, comes from focus on a single thing and becoming the best at that one thing. one other quote that I liked was from Francis Upton who said, the one great impression of my years in Menlo park was how impenetrable the veil of the future seems to be when new problems are to be solved and how simple", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/thomas-edison", "title": "Thomas Edison", "chunk_index": 42, "publication_date": "2020-04-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 53}}
{"text": "best at that one thing . one other quote that I liked was from Francis Upton who said , the one great impression of my years in Menlo park was how impenetrable the veil of the future seems to be when new problems are to be solved and how simple Thomas Edison: the result often is. When the darkness of ignorance is lighted by the genius of one man. , one story that I had to cut that I really liked and actually probably wish I had left in his from the time when he was demonstrating his light bulb in New York city, and it's in this great concert hall and the dynamo is not yet perfected. There's no power grid. So how has he powering this thing? Well, next door, they literally have a. Coal burner, that they're using to generate electricity. And so at some point during the demonstration, the lights start to go a little bit dim. And so Harrison's going home now, what's going on? So he goes next door, and the guy who was on the job had fallen asleep, who was supposed to be loading coal to keep this thing fired, to keep this thing powered, to keep the lights on next door. And so as in, you know, he takes off his jacket and starts shoveling coal. To keep the lights on. I like that story because it demonstrates kind of how hands on and how basic the technology was. Right? and I just think it's cool to think about that era of technology and everything was so tactile and kind of hands on one other kind of small story. Speaking of tactile and hands on that I didn't get to mention was. You know, Harrison is doing all this work on the photograph and he can barely hear, and especially late in life, he's working on perfecting the phonograph and coming out with new versions of it. And at this point, this guy is really deaf. I mean, really can not hear much. people have to shout into his ear in order to be heard. So how does he hear the music that's coming out of his phonograph? How does he know if it sounds good or not? And so what he would actually do is they had wood casing and he would bite the wood and the sound would vibrate through his teeth into a skull. And that's how he would hear. And the consequence of this was, that's a different way of hearing. Right? it just sounds different. And so the decisions that he made about the phonograph and about the music that was being played on it. We're, uh, we're kind of bad. But he was so confident that he understood. He knew what was, what sounded good and what didn't", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/thomas-edison", "title": "Thomas Edison", "chunk_index": 43, "publication_date": "2020-04-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 53}}

He knew what was , what sounded good and what didn ' t Thomas Edison: sound good. but he insisted on making those decisions. , even though he had this really weird way of listening to the phonograph of, of biting the photograph, of biting the wood around it. Um, , next, my review of the current war, uh, which is a movie that came out last year, I think it came out late 2019. That is about the rivalry between Edison and Westinghouse, uh, and features Tesla very heavily. So it's supposed to be, um. Kind of historical fiction. Right. And, um, so I guess I'm not going to discuss every historical inaccuracy of the movie, cause I just don't want to be that guy. Uh, there are a lot. so just know that, um, so that if you're watching it and you say, Whoa, it says that Edison's wife died of an incurable brain disease. , but I heard on how to take over the world, but she died suddenly of a morphine overdose. I'm right. The movie's wrong. They just, I don't begrudge them that. It's a movie. They have to make it an interesting narrative. so they deviate a lot. A lot of the dates are wrong. A lot of the people are kind of, they have to mash them together and all sorts of stuff. Right. So, uh, I'm not gonna correct every single historical inaccuracy, but just some things, I guess overall. Uh some thoughts I had. Number one, they make Edison this amazing family man, and as I've told you. He was really doting, , and loving towards his wife and children, wives and children. But he was never home. I mean, he was at the office, he was at the workstation all the time. And so, especially, you know, second wife, Mina would talk about how she would bring her children and go in to see Edison, and she'd be so mad at him. But he had this like charm thing that if you hear people talk about really charismatic people, I've heard people say this about bill Clinton, who's a former president of the United States, that he would, he can turn this charm on and he just focuses all his attention on you, like a laser beam. And people who hate him, who hate his guts just find themselves instantly won over. And Edison had this too. Amina would go in and", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/thomas-edison", "title": "Thomas Edison", "chunk_index": 44, "publication_date": "2020-04-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 53}}
{"text": ", he can turn this charm on and he just focuses all his attention on you , like a laser beam . And people who hate him , who hate his guts just find themselves instantly won over . And Edison had this too . Amina would go in and Thomas Edison: she's mad because she hasn't seen him in like two weeks. He's been sleeping at the office. He just hasn't come home. She's mad. And she walks in there with her kids, say, Hey, look at your children. Say hi to them. Spend some time with them. And he just shifts all his attention to her. She says, Mina, I'm so happy to see you. And immediately the anger is gone. He melts her. , and so he was this like really super loving, doting husband and father. When he was around, which was like never. so anyways, I think the movie probably makes him seem a little more present than he actually was. Another thing that's funny to me, I just have to point this out. Samuel insole in the movie, they make this like meek little secretary who is Edison's pawn and does whatever Edison wants. Edison actually at various times felt very betrayed by insult because he became this nigga millionaire. In part by doing some stuff, some business decisions that probably had to be made. But he cut Edison out of a lot of the decision making at general electric. And he was like a very strong personality, , who kind of took no prisoners. And so it's funny to see him portrayed as this like, yes, sir. Yes, mr Edison, whatever you want, sir. And just on the nature of personality, like I just think they make Edison in the movie scene. Uh, to adapt at social situations. I don't think they quite got right. The like addictive nature of Edison's personality. If he was doing anything except for inventing, , he was just, he wanted to get it out of the way. He wanted to get back to inventing. Another weird thing about the movie is their insistence that no one died from alternating current. Uh, except for people who were executed in the electric chair. , it's just not true at all. I mean, in the early days of electricity when they were stringing up wires, people died relatively frequently and people died all the time from electric power. It was a new and dangerous technology. So, um, I'm not sure why the movie went that direction. And they also don't get into what was a huge part of the war between Westinghouse and Edison, which was a patent lawsuit. A Westinghouse lost the patent lawsuit and had to pay Edison $15", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/thomas-edison", "title": "Thomas Edison", "chunk_index": 45, "publication_date": "2020-04-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 53}}
{"text": "m not sure why the movie went that direction . And they also don ' t get into what was a huge part of the war between Westinghouse and Edison , which was a patent lawsuit . A Westinghouse lost the patent lawsuit and had to pay Edison $ 15 Thomas Edison: million. For violating the basic light bulb patent, , which essentially took the, the current Wars, as they call them. this war between Edison electric and Westinghouse, Westinghouse was destroying Edison, and then Edison wins this patent battle, and Edison has paid $15 million, which was a ton, a ton of money, which kind of turns it into a draw. So I find it funny that they didn't mention that patent lawsuit, but that was also an important part of it. One thing that they do demonstrate I didn't talk about was Edison's assistance in developing the electric chair. A William Kemmler was the first man given the electric chair. And it was a disaster. , they thought it would be like this quick, painless thing, flip the switch and boom, he's that instant, painless. Great. Uh, what actually happened was they flipped the switch and it took two minutes to kill the guy. , the body hair on his body was singeing off and it was making people sick. spectators were starting to throw up, who would come to watch and observe the execution. , and it just like, it was gruesome, the way that he eventually died. Like essentially they fried him. That's how he died. from like being cooked from being heated up from the inside out. So really, really gruesome. They, they kind of worked on it. They got higher voltages. Electric chair did eventually, I guess, get a little more humane. but, but not much. There's a reason that people don't die really from the electric chair anymore. It was not a great form of execution. probably not exactly a proud moment of Edison's life that he, uh, that he worked on that , one question that people have asked me a couple of times was about his marriages. And his marriages, um, were not the happiest because he was around so infrequently. Uh, his wives sometimes felt a little bit abandoned, which is obviously very easy to understand. I would say that his first marriage was worse because Mary didn't know what she was signing up for. Right. Edison wasn't famous at the time, so he kind of charmed her. She said, yes, she married this guy and all of a sudden. She's thrust into the spotlight of being married to this world famous man, and he's never around, and she didn't know that was going to be part of the equation.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/thomas-edison", "title": "Thomas Edison", "chunk_index": 46, "publication_date": "2020-04-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 53}}
{"text": ", she married this guy and all of a sudden . She ' s thrust into the spotlight of being married to this world famous man , and he ' s never around , and she didn ' t know that was going to be part of the equation . Thomas Edison: whereas MENA, when she married Edison, he was already famous and she knew what she was signing up for. Uh, maybe not the extent of it. She was certainly still annoyed frequently that he was not around as much as she would like. And it's just difficult to deal with celebrity. And she was in the spotlight a lot, but you know, I think she dealt with it better than Mary for that reason. She kinda knew what she was getting into. His children. Um, his sons from his first marriage, William and Tom, were, uh, they were a thorn in his side for his whole life. They were always making trouble. They embarrassed him. They married kind of disreputable women. they would make all these claims that, you know, especially Tom Thomas Edison, jr would sell the rights to his name because then people would just take any old invention and say, Hey, you know, this is the Thomas Edison, and then very little letters jr this is the Thomas Edison. Lamp, this is the Thomas Edison, whatever, and uh, and trying to scam people into buying it, these kind of low quality products. So Tom was going around selling his name. Edison had to like, threaten to Sue his son to get him to stop. So yeah, William and Tom troublemakers never really made much of their lives. his sons from his other marriage were much more helpful. So Charles was one of those sons. He was like the most interesting man in the world. He was not only a very successful business executive, he wrote poetry and composed songs and was was kind of a ladies man early in his life. He eventually became the governor of New Jersey, and he was the CEO of Edison inc for a while and was a very successful CEO. Did well and uh, had a working relationship with his father. His other son, Theodore, was the only son who really followed his dad's path in becoming an inventor and Theodore, while not as prolific as his father was, a very gifted mentor, had over 80 patents, I think, in his life. So he did well for himself as well. In terms of the daughters. Marion, who was a daughter from his first marriage, married a guy in Germany, and, uh, that marriage didn't last. So eventually she came back to the United States. Never had children, never had a career. Um, so her life was, was a little bit sad. And then his", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/thomas-edison", "title": "Thomas Edison", "chunk_index": 47, "publication_date": "2020-04-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 53}}
{"text": "guy in Germany , and , uh , that marriage didn ' t last . So eventually she came back to the United States . Never had children , never had a career . Um , so her life was , was a little bit sad . And then his Thomas Edison: daughter, Madeline from his second marriage, , was very intelligent, very ambitious, was actually probably the most like Thomas Edison, frankly, um, did not have a career, decided to get married. Instead, she married a very successful airplane manufacturer. Successful businessman. And she had four children of her own. She's actually the only Edison grandchild to have children, which is kind of funny to me that five of his six children did not have children of their own. But, uh, but Madeline did. Um, another similarity. Elon Musk, Thomas Edison was very interested in solar power and figuring out how to harness it and store it. And Edison was something of a, uh, environmentalist. They didn't really have environmentalist back then in the same way that we do now. Uh, it was kind of just emerging as a school of thought. But, uh, listen to this quote from Edison, I think it's interesting. He said, quote, someday some fellow will invent a way of concentrating and storing sunshine to use instead of this old, absurd Prometheus's scheme of fire. I'll do the trick myself if someone doesn't get at it. This scheme of combustion in order to get power makes me sick. To think of it is so wasteful. We should utilize natural forces and thus get all of our power. Sunshine is a form of energy and the winds and the tides are manifestations of energy. Do we use them? Oh no. We burn up wood and coal as renters burn up the front fence for fuel. We live like squatters. Not as if we owned the property. There must surely come a time when he empower will be stored in unlimited quantities in every community, all gathered by natural forces. Electricity ought to be as cheap as oxygen for it cannot be destroyed. End quote . One other thing that I thought about interesting. Someone has a quote, they mentioned the peculiar nocturnal brightening of the human owl and yeah, I like this idea of referring to Edison as a, as a human owl. , not only did he work really weird hours, really late hours, but he actually did some of his best work, , between the hours of like 10:00 PM and 6:00 AM. Uh, and I don't know particularly why that is, but I do think that he got some sort of high off of working when other people were not working. There's a famous quote I've heard that I like,", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/thomas-edison", "title": "Thomas Edison", "chunk_index": 48, "publication_date": "2020-04-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 53}}
{"text": "AM . Uh , and I don ' t know particularly why that is , but I do think that he got some sort of high off of working when other people were not working . There ' s a famous quote I ' ve heard that I like , Thomas Edison: I've heard it variously attributed to, so I don't know who really said it first, but the quote is, when you are not practicing, remember someone somewhere is practicing and when you meet him, he will win. And so I think the Edison probably felt that way. It sure seems like it. That Henny moment, he wasn't inventing. Someone else was, and so he wanted to make as few of those moments as possible. He wanted to be there at the lab bench when no one else was, and if that seems totally unsustainable. Uh, it is, uh, if you don't do it right. remember, Edison didn't just work all the time. He did work all the time for long stretches, but then he would also take these multi-week vacations out West or down to Florida. And so I do think it's important to think about that of Metta balance. You know, I think that probably balance in any given day is overrated. You don't necessarily need to eat a balanced breakfast and work out every day and do yoga and meditation and all these things that people tell you you should do every day. I don't think you necessarily need to, but it's important to balance it out over time. So if you're going to be a workaholic for a week or two, which is something I'll often do, especially when I'm turning out these episodes, you know, I just will, will not sleep much and I'll do my day job and then I'll straight go to working on this. And uh, go to bed really, really late, wake up really, really early. But then I'll spend the weekend sleeping a lot, a lot, a lot, and just relaxing and doing nothing. And . Edison kind of did this in the most maximalist sort of way. He just worked all the time, all the time. And then when he went on vacation, he went for weeks and sometimes months. One, one small note. Edison went on a grand tour of Europe with his family, and one of the things that he commented was that Europeans were, were too fat. , he was disgusted by how, you know, grotesquely obese, how fat all of these people were, which to me is just so funny that, Americans were criticizing how that Europeans were a hundred years ago. Oh, how the times have changed. one other kind of small", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/thomas-edison", "title": "Thomas Edison", "chunk_index": 49, "publication_date": "2020-04-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 53}}
{"text": "how , you know , grotesquely obese , how fat all of these people were , which to me is just so funny that , Americans were criticizing how that Europeans were a hundred years ago . Oh , how the times have changed . one other kind of small Thomas Edison: note, I guess I wanted to make. Is that. Thomas Edison's mother homeschooled him, educated him, and to me, he was kind of the perfect example of a Puritan woman. So if you don't know Puritans, where this religious sect that came from England settled in new England, the area we now know is new. England kind of started in Massachusetts and spread out from there. And they were very, very religiously observant, extremely strict. and very highly educated. You can look them up. They're the pilgrims that you hear about sometimes. Uh, if you, if you live in America, the people that were there at Thanksgiving, right? Those are the Puritans. and, um. Edison comes from very, very Puritan stock. , and his mother was the daughter of a Methodist minister. So, uh, yeah, like very, very Puritan. And I commented this to someone that, you know, that doesn't, his mom was like the perfect Puritan woman, super educated, always, you know, teaching him. And they went, Whoa. Puritan women were educated and I thought that they were like super oppressed and under lock and key because. Uh, of Handmaid's tale. And I guess they use kind of like Puritan imagery in Handmaid's tale. I don't know. I haven't seen the show, so I'm not gonna criticize it too much, but I do just want to comment that if this is something that is portrayed in Handmaid's tale, that Puritans were somehow extremely oppressive of women. I mean, Puritans were just like oppressive, right? Uh, they were super, super strict. , in a lot of different ways, but it was one of the peculiarities of their culture that Puritan women were highly educated. It was a very egalitarian society. And so that's just not accurate. I think that's a misconception that a lot of people have. And the other thing about Puritans, I mean, I think Edison is like the end result of a couple of hundred years of like Puritan interbreeding because Puritans were obsessed. With working these people. Just thought that was how you demonstrated, you know, your faith and belief to God was, was hard work. and they really valorize that in their culture. In Puritan society, it was a crime to do nothing. Like literally you could just be doing nothing. And that was a crime cause you weren't working. Right.

{"text": ", was hard work . and they really valorize that in their culture . In Puritan society , it was a crime to do nothing . Like literally you could just be doing nothing . And that was a crime cause you weren ' t working . Right . So Thomas Edison: you get a couple of hundred years of Puritans. Intermarrying and hand, uh, having this culture. And then you get the daughter of a Methodist minister, you know, from peer 10 stock, she marries a, another peer of 10. She has a son. And then you have this guy who is completely obsessed with working, right? He's a complete, he's a workaholic and invents his whole life. So, you know, I. I don't think it's an accident that a, the Edison was like this. When you take into consideration where he came from and the, the culture and the history of, of the Puritan people, uh, if you want to learn a little bit more about this, um, and how kind of Puritan culture in some ways still shapes America. A really interesting book. It's called Albion seed that talks about that. I highly recommend it. But yeah, Thomas Edison, super Puritan, even though he wasn't religious, super Puritan. a couple other things. One is industrial sabotage. Industrial espionage. Both were extremely common during Edison's time. So, um you know, he's inventing the light bulb, especially when he's having public demonstrations. People from Westinghouse, people from other companies are just walking into Menlo park and just unscrewing light bulbs and taking them. And, uh, in fact, it gets, it gets really bad. They have these public demonstrations and they can't tell the difference between Westinghouse people who are stealing them for, uh, for espionage purposes. And just, you know, bystanders who want a souvenir and take the chance to, to lift a Edison light bulb. Uh, but this was a big problem. It was a, it was a different time, like during the current war is when Westinghouse and Edison are both trying to electrify New York city. You know, it got really, uh, it got dirty, you know, with people intimidating each other and beating each other up and, and business was really like bare knuckles back then. That's not something I talked a lot about because. Edison himself didn't have a lot of involvement in it, but I do think it's a really interesting aspect of, of that time period, and if you want to learn more about it, the book, the current war is, is good.

And so his last days of night , there ' s another interesting book about that time period . Thomas Edison: the last thing, and then I'll end on this, even though it's kinda early from his life, here's a quote from Edison. So his very, very first you mentioned the first thing that he successfully patents is the electric vote recorder. And so Edison is a nobody, right? So how are you going to make an electric vote recorder to show off for the patent office? He has to. Make it. Um, and so he literally has to, you know, the casing for the thing. Of course he can do the electronics. He's a Telegraph operator. He's working with electronics all the time, but he has to like carve the casing for this thing. So he does, he carves the wood and makes the casing for this thing. And he has a quote that he said later in life, he said, to become a good inventor, you must first know how to use a Jack knife. In other words, like you gotta know how to do the nitty gritty, dirty details of inventing. You can't just sit there with your head in the clouds and think up new things, right? Get out the knife and start carving wood. And that reminded me of a quote from Pablo Picasso. He said, quote, when art critics get together, they talk about form and structure and meaning. When artists get together, they talk about where you can buy cheap turpentine. And, uh, I think that's very true. So, uh, if you want some parting advice on the life of Thomas Edison, uh, I think it's, you know, make yourself useful. don't be one of those people who thinks about a forum and structure and meaning. And I always have my head in the clouds because I am a big thinker, you know, learn a skill, be useful to other people and, and build off of that. Build your way up. Um, okay. That's it. This was a little bit rambling. a little bit different. let me know what you thought in terms of the future. Uh, we've got some Catherine the great episodes coming.

{"text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger: Arnold! Arnold! Arnold, come on! The voices of his friends drifted up from the lake. Arnold was 15 years old, hanging out with his friends by the lake in his hometown of Thal, Austria. They had carried in weights and were working out in the grass and trees. Arnold was far from the biggest or strongest. In fact, he was brand new to bodybuilding. But already, he was showing signs of promise. He was naturally athletic and his body was very adaptive, rapidly building strength and size in response to the little weight training he had already undertaken. He had a vision now. He later said, It was more than a young boy's mere pipe dream of a distant hazy future, confused fantasies of being a fireman, detective, sailor, test pilot, or spy. I knew I was going to be a bodybuilder. It wasn't simply that either. I would be the best bodybuilder in the world. The greatest. The best built man. He shook himself out of his daydream and joined his friends curling dumbbells, doing pull ups on tree branches, and doing handstand push ups in the grass. He was lifting more intensely than them, pushing himself harder, because he could see his destiny now. He saw himself standing on a podium, holding a trophy, and he could hear the cheering in his ears. It would take years for the rest of the world to find out, but he already knew his destiny. Run footage from one of his victories where people are shouting Arnold, Arnold, Arnold. Hello, and welcome to How to Take Over the World. This is Ben Wilson, and this episode is about the life of Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Austrian American bodybuilder, actor, entrepreneur, and politician. How I already know that some of you are going to complain that he didn't truly take over the world. And you're right insofar as clearly he's not a Caesar or an Alexander, and he's still alive. He's not even a historical figure. But there are a few reasons why I wanted to do this episode. One is that Arnold's first autobiography, The Education of a Bodybuilder, is one of my favorite books of all time. It's really amazing. And the second reason is that I just love Arnold's mindset. I find it incredibly motivating. And obviously the story is going to have a lot of applications to a lot of people, aspiring athletes, entrepreneurs, actors, influencers, and politicians can all learn something", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/arnold-schwarzenegger", "title": "Arnold Schwarzenegger", "chunk_index": 0, "publication_date": "2024-03-21", "total_chunks_in_doc": 26}}

And obviously the story is going to have a lot of applications to a lot of people , aspiring athletes , entrepreneurs , actors , influencers , and politicians can all learn something Arnold Schwarzenegger: from what he did. I really loved researching it and I hope you enjoy it. My sources for this episode are Arnold's three autobiographical books. The first is Arnold, The Education of a Bodybuilder, written in 1977. The next is total recall, which he wrote in 2013. And then the last is called be useful seven tools for life, which was published this year in 2024. And by the way, if you like it and you want to learn more about Arnold, let me recommend the founders podcast episode 309 founders is a lot like how to take over the world, but it's about great founders. And it's specifically for aspiring entrepreneurs. And in episode 309, the host, David Senra, goes over his takeaways from the book, Arnold and Me in the Shadow of the Austrian Oak, which is a biography from Arnold's first girlfriend. And it's a really interesting perspective because she's kind of an outsider, so it dives into, um, how other people saw him early in his career, and it gets into a lot of stuff that I don't talk about in this episode. So thank you to founders for supporting how to take over the world. I love David and he's got a great podcast, so go check it out wherever you get your podcasts. Okay, let's get into it. Here is the life of Arnold Schwarzenegger origins. Arnold Schwarzenegger was born in Thal, Austria in 1947. In the wake of world war two, his father was a proud and strong man who keenly felt the sting of defeat of the German army in which he had served during the war. His father cared very much for his two sons, but he could be very strict and implemented a very regimented life of discipline. Here's what Arnold wrote about it. He said, His answer to life was discipline. We had a strict routine that nothing could change. We'd get up at six, and it would be my job, or Meinhard's, that's his brother, to get milk from the farm next door. When we were a little older and starting to play sports, exercises were added to the chores, and we had to earn our breakfast by doing sit ups. In the afternoon, we'd finish our homework and chores, and my father would make us practice soccer no matter how bad the weather was. If we messed up on a play, we knew we'd get yelled at. He had high expectations,", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/arnold-schwarzenegger", "title": "Arnold Schwarzenegger", "chunk_index": 1, "publication_date": "2024-03-21", "total_chunks_in_doc": 26}}
{"text": "the afternoon , we ' d finish our homework and chores , and my father would make us practice soccer no matter how bad the weather was . If we messed up on a play , we knew we ' d get yelled at . He had high expectations , Arnold Schwarzenegger: which Arnold often failed to live up to. Arnold was entrepreneurial, and this sometimes got him into trouble. For example, he found one good way of getting money was simply asking for it. He would go to the nearby city of Graz and pretend that he had forgotten the money for the train ride home and make decent money asking various people, usually older ladies, for a few bucks for the trip home. But soon, his father found out that his son was begging in Graz. Arnold wrote, This led to a huge uproar at home with tremendous physical punishment, and that put an end to my panhandling career. He was also an athletic boy, competing and standing out in a number of sports. The one that stuck out the most was soccer. He liked soccer, but didn't love it. Arnold loved being the center of attention, and a big team sport like soccer didn't lend itself to the kind of glory that he enjoyed. However, Arnold made a fortuitous discovery when his coach took the team to do some weightlifting to strengthen the boys legs. And Arnold immediately took to it. He later said, I'm not exactly sure why I chose bodybuilding, except that I loved it. I loved it from the first moment my fingers closed around a barbell and I felt the challenge and exhilaration of hoisting the heavy steel plates above my head. And one of the reasons I love the book, The Education of a Bodybuilder, so much is that you can just feel the enthusiasm and the obsession dripping off of Arnold. He's so in love with bodybuilding. He said, After two or three months with the bodybuilders, I was literally addicted. I loved the feel of the cold iron and steel warming to my touch, and the sounds and smells of the gym, and I still love it. There is nothing I would sooner hear than the sound of heavy steel plates ringing as they are threaded onto the bar or dropped back to the rack after a strenuous lift. I remember the first real workout I had as vividly as if it were last night. I mean, to me, it sounds a lot like a love letter. It's almost romantic. As you might have gathered from that passage, Arnold quickly progresses beyond just lifting with the soccer team, and he starts working out with real weightlifters and bodybuilders. And he really falls in love with this crowd. He loves them and they love him. But the sport isn't popular. Weightlifting and bodybuilding were totally different back then. People really looked", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/arnold-schwarzenegger", "title": "Arnold Schwarzenegger", "chunk_index": 2, "publication_date": "2024-03-21", "total_chunks_in_doc": 26}}

Weightlifting and bodybuilding were totally different back then . People really looked Arnold Schwarzenegger: down on it. Bodybuilders were thought of as freaks. Almost no one just casually engaged in weightlifting. His friends, and especially his parents, try to talk him out of this newfound obsession. But he just can't be dissuaded. He says, I remember certain people trying to put negative thoughts into my mind, trying to persuade me to slow down. I had found the thing to which I wanted to devote my total energies, and there was no stopping me. My drive was unusual. I talked differently than my friends. I was hungrier for success than anyone I knew. I love that passage. I had found the thing to which I wanted to devote my total energies and there was no stopping me. I think there's so much clarity that comes into your life when you find that one thing. Another big moment for young Arnold is when he first gets a bodybuilding magazine and sees a photograph of someone named Reg Park. Reg was Mr. Universe, the world's top bodybuilder, and he had leveraged his status as a bodybuilder into success as an actor as well. Arnold becomes completely obsessed with Reg. I love that passage. with the look of his physique. He was enormous, his body was breathtaking. Arnold writes that, from that point on, my life was utterly dominated by Reg Park. In weeks that followed, I refined this vision until it was very specific. I was going to go for the Mr. Universe title. I was going to break records in powerlifting. I was going to Hollywood. I was going to be like Reg Park. The vision became so clear in my mind that I felt like it had to happen. There was no alternative. It was this, or nothing. He puts up pictures of Reg in his bedroom. He read everything that Reg wrote that had been translated into German. He studied every photograph he could find. He is just obsessed. And this follows a common theme, great achievers always pattern themselves after other greats. And this is sort of the thesis of this podcast, that you can become great by studying the other greats. You know, John D. Rockefeller was patterning himself after this guy Amos Lawrence, who made a bunch of money and gave it away. Napoleon was trying to be Julius Caesar. Steve Jobs was trying to be Edwin Land. Thomas Edison was trying to be Michael Faraday. It goes on and on. But it's not always just one person.

So his life becomes consumed by trying to imitate Reg Park , but he is able Arnold Schwarzenegger: to actually have contact with and learn from a guy named Kurt Marnul, who was Mr. Austria. So not as accomplished as Reg, but still a great bodybuilder in his own right. And Kurt kind of takes Arnold under his wing. And Arnold is totally obsessed. He writes in Total Recall, Soon life at the gym totally consumed me. Training was all I could think about. One Sunday when I found the stadium locked, I broke in and worked out in the freezing cold. I had to wrap my hands in towels to keep them from sticking to the metal bars. So, he's so obsessed he's willing to do anything and nothing is going to stop him. So throughout high school, he's lifting weights and getting stronger and stronger and bigger and bigger. And this obsession has a special effect. He says, before long people began looking at me as a special person. Partly this was the result of my own changing attitude about myself. I was growing, getting bigger, gaining confidence. I was given consideration I had never received before. It was as though I were the son of a millionaire. I'd walk into a room at school and my classmates would offer me food or ask if they could help me with my homework. Even my teachers treated me differently, especially after I started winning trophies in the weightlifting contests I entered. This is one of my biggest takeaways from the life of Arnold. When you have a really clear vision, the world almost like conspires to help you achieve it. This isn't something woo woo, like the universe isn't speaking to you, um, there's nothing like weird metaphysical. I think it's more about people are really attracted to a strong vision, to a strong will. They want to be a part of it. And the world really lacks people with strong vision and will. So when you express that, people just respond. They're willing to help you out. And that is something you see over and over in Arnold's career, is people helping him for no apparent reason. But it's because when you see someone with that strong of a vision, you want to see them accomplish it. You want to help and be a part of it in some way. Early on, that is something as simple as his neighbor saying, Hey Arnold, let us know if you need extra eggs or milk. I know for weightlifting you need milk.

Another great example of this is when he graduates from high Arnold Schwarzenegger: school and has to go into the army. They have compulsory service in Austria. You have to serve time in the army when you graduate from high school. So Arnold goes in and he is a tank driver. And while he's in the army, he gets invited to the junior division of the Mr. Europe contest in Stuttgart, Germany. But he's in basic training. You can't leave. And he asks for leave. He says, hey, can I go compete in this competition? And his officers say no. So he has to decide, all right, what do I do? Well, he decides, he sneaks out anyway, and he goes and he competes in Mr. Europe. He has to borrow money to get there and back. He has to borrow posing trunks, like all these strangers are just giving him stuff to help him realize his dream. And, uh, and be able to compete in the contest. In the Genghis Khan episode, I called this the golden boy effect. People just wanting to help you for no reason. But again, it's not for no reason. Genghis Khan wrote, Without the vision of a goal, a man cannot manage his own life, much less the lives of others. And that's exactly what it is. That vision of a goal that people respond to and makes them want to help you. So anyway, he goes, he sneaks out, and he wins the Mr. Europe competition. This is his first real taste of international recognition. People go wild for his physique. He's the toast of the competition. He's not the most chiseled or the most fit, but he's huge and people really respond to that sheer size. He's only 19 years old. He's already much bigger than a lot of the other competitors and the judges and the people in the competition, they can tell that this guy, that this kid, Arnold is going to be the next big thing, but he doesn't get to bask in his victory for long. He's got to go back to Austria and try to sneak back into his military base. But when he's climbing the wall, he is caught. And thrown in military jail, but in jail, he's telling everyone about his victory showing off his trophy and eventually his officers decide that this success is actually bringing prestige and honor to the army. So not only do they let him out of jail, they create a", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/arnold-schwarzenegger", "title": "Arnold Schwarzenegger", "chunk_index": 5, "publication_date": "2024-03-21", "total_chunks_in_doc": 26}}
{"text": "jail , but in jail , he ' s telling everyone about his victory showing off his trophy and eventually his officers decide that this success is actually bringing prestige and honor to the army . So not only do they let him out of jail , they create a Arnold Schwarzenegger: weight room, fully stock it with weights and give him relief from his regular duties so that he has time to train and give him full access to the mess hall whenever he wants so that he can get as much nutrition as he needs. So, in this year, in the army, half of it, he's basically a full time bodybuilder. You know, this should have been an obstacle to his bodybuilding career. He instead comes out 25 pounds heavier and is in even better shape. Rise in Europe. One of the judges in Mr. Europe, a guy Arnold calls Schneck, had taken a liking to Arnold and made him an offer. He said, whenever you're done in the military, come see me in Munich, Germany. And I'll give you a place to stay and a place to train. And he tells him, if you come out and train with me, I'll even buy you a ticket to London to go watch the Mr. Universe contest. And Arnold's immediate response is, watch, I'm not going to go, just watch. So he has plans that, uh, he's going to go, he's going to stay with this guy, Schneck, he's going to train. And then in only a year, as a 20 year old, he wants to compete in Mr. Universe. So after only a year in the army, Arnold shows up in Munich penniless. And true to his word, Schneck gives him a place to stay and a place to work out and a job as a trainer at the gymnasium. Schneck said that he had an extra bedroom. But when Arnold shows up at his apartment. Uh, this extra bedroom doesn't have a bed in it. And so he tells Arnold that the bed is coming really soon, and in the meantime, he can sleep on the couch. But day after day, the bed never comes. And finally, Schneck comes in at night and says, You know, that couch looks really uncomfortable. Why don't you just come stay in my bed with me? And, uh, he's clearly making moves on Arnold. And so Arnold freaks out and tries to leave and Schneck follows him into the street and reasons with them saying, look, don't go, just come inside. It's not that bad. Lots of guys do it. And if you will be my special friend, I can make everything happen for you.

I can get you into all the big competitions. I can pay for your equipment and your travel. All you have to do is come back inside. And Arnold says that he actually considers it. He had this clear vision of exactly what he wanted and here was someone offering him all of it Everything that he wanted in life, but to his credit Arnold says no and he walks away He wasn't willing to compromise on who he was on his fundamental values and he wanted to accomplish his dreams on his own terms So he finds some ratty spare bedroom that he can stay in and continues to work out And actually Schneck allows him to continue to work at his gym. Their relationship is obviously kind of weird and a little strained. Um, but he is working for this guy. Munich was a boom town in the late 1960s. He was a fast city with a huge population of recent transplants and a vibrant nightlife. And Arnold fed on the energy. He also fed on his association with the other regulars at the gym. This was the first time he could seriously train with other serious bodybuilders on a regular semi professional basis. And he had only one goal. Become Mr. Universe. He said, At that point, my own thinking was tuned into He said, At that point, my own thinking was tuned into only one thing. Becoming Mr. Universe. In my own mind, I was Mr. Universe. I had this absolutely clear vision of myself up on the dais with the trophy. It was only a matter of time before the world, it was only a matter of time before the whole world would be able to see it too. And it made no difference to me how much I had to struggle to get there. So he's got this clear vision. He really wants to be Mr. Universe. But as he starts to study the other competitors, the people who he knows will be competing next year in Mr. Universe, he starts to get a little bit intimidated. He says, no, I decided I can't be the guy who won. I'd look at the second place winner. No, I can't beat him. I'd look at the guy who placed third. I can't beat him either. I went right down the line trying to figure out who I might beat. I got to 8th or 9th place and figured I might have a chance if I tried hard enough.

{"text": "who placed third . I can ' t beat him either . I went right down the line trying to figure out who I might beat . I got to 8th or 9th place and figured I might have a chance if I tried hard enough . It was a Arnold Schwarzenegger: loser's way of looking at it. I defeated myself before I even entered, before I'd even completed the year's training. But I was young, I was being self protective. I hadn't yet pulled together my ideas about positive thinking and the powers of the mind over the muscles. So he trains all year with his mindset, and then, He goes, he enters the competition, and he competes with what he calls, this is his loser's mindset, and he does surprisingly well. He's just hoping to place in the top six. Um, but he takes second place. He loses to the American Chet Yorton and, uh, and gets the silver medal. He's not optimized at all. He hasn't optimized his physique, he's too heavy, he hasn't optimized his posing, he doesn't know the proper way to pose to maximize the effect on the judges and the crowd. He said, as always, once I was over the initial disappointment of losing, I began trying to understand exactly why I had lost. I tried to be honest, to analyze it fairly. Aside from my total lack of finish, I still had some serious weaknesses. I'd come to the contest with something good, but not good enough to win. I had a lot of mass, a great rough cut. My weak points were calves and thighs. I needed to work on posing, on diet, and all the finer points of bodybuilding. So he is very honest with himself, and that was one of his trademarks, was he wanted to be completely honest in his self criticism. He didn't want to have any surprises for himself. He didn't want to delude himself. So he has an opportunity to up his game when he's brought in by one of the judges. A guy named Charles Wagbennett, who helps him train in London in preparation for the next Mr. Olympia the following year. He also works out with Chet Yorton, the guy who had just beaten him. Wagbennett teaches him to put music to his posing routine, and works with him on his legs, his calves, his thighs, and his abs, all his weak points, to get ready for the next year. He is a data junkie, is what you might call him. He's constantly measuring himself, so he doesn't want to just rely on Kind of amorphous impressions. He really wants to know, okay, what's my", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/arnold-schwarzenegger", "title": "Arnold Schwarzenegger", "chunk_index": 8, "publication_date": "2024-03-21", "total_chunks_in_doc": 26}}

He really wants to know , okay , what ' s my Arnold Schwarzenegger: ratio of my arms to my waist with my ratio of my calves to my thighs. He's constantly measuring to see when he's adding mass and to see exactly what he needs to do. He also at this time, um, is kind of a, a self described dirtbag. Um, he says that when you're at that time in life, When you're striving really hard for something, but you're not yet at the top, it's typical for people to become kind of jerks. He is a jerk at this time. He's just running through girls and relationships. You know, he won't settle down into a real relationship, different girl every night, because he thinks that any sort of relationship might distract him. And he's also picking fights all the time because he knows he's big. Uh, he knows he can beat up on a lot of these people and he likes this way of kind of puffing himself up. So he's getting into bar fights like every weekend. So it's not the best mindset for him as a person. It's maybe a little bit toxic, but he is training really hard and he is. Uh, at least inside the gym, trying to get his mindset right. He wrote, I knew I was a winner. I knew I was destined for great things. People will say that kind of thinking is totally immodest. I agree. Modesty is not a word that applies to me in any way. I hope it never will. He's also dialing in his training. And one of the ways he does that is when he works out with Chet Yorton, the guy who had beaten him, he's observing exactly how he lifts, how he trains, to see if he can pick up any secrets. And here's what he says. He said, I had thought perhaps he had some special exercises. But that wasn't true. He concentrated on the standard exercises. That was his secret. Concentration. He worked to get everything an exercise could give him. And so concentration becomes a big theme for Arnold. Becomes a part of how he differentiates himself and succeeds. So he has a bunch of great quotes that I love about concentration. So here's one. He says, I started training in an area where there were no distractions. There was nothing else going on.

{"text": "love about concentration . So here ' s one . He says , I started training in an area where there were no distractions . There was nothing else going on . And that gave me enough time to concentrate and find out what bodybuilding was . was really all Arnold Schwarzenegger: about another one. He says they weren't mentally prepared for intensive championship training. They weren't thinking about it. I knew the secret concentrate while you're training. Do not allow other thoughts to enter your mind. Another one. He says it became part of my routine that year to start out every day with total concentration. The way I did it was to play out exactly what I was going to use, how I was going to pull my muscles, and how I would feel it. I programmed myself. I saw myself doing it. I imagined how I would feel it. I was thoroughly, totally into it mentally. I did not waver at all. All my energies, both psychic and physical, were focused on one thing. Becoming Mr. Universe. And so that emphasis on concentration really stands out to me because it reminds me of of a quote from John D. Rockefeller about concentration. He said, Do not many of us who fail to achieve big things fail because we lack concentration, the art of concentrating the mind on the thing to be done at the proper time and to the exclusion of everything else. Another thing that Arnold does is just train more. So yeah, he's trying to train differently by concentrating more, but he's also just like, you know, One of the only ways to be better is to work harder, do more. So he says, I sacrificed a lot of things. Most bodybuilders didn't want to give up. I just didn't care. I wanted to win more than anything and whatever it took to do it, I did. So he's spending insane amounts of time in the gym, five, six hours per day. No one is going to outwork him. One of my favorite stories is when he starts to plateau and he's trying to find new things to do. So in weightlifting, um, you know, especially when you're starting out, you lift and your body just responds, you're just growing, you're getting stronger. But then you realize after a while of working out in the same way, um, your body stops growing and you hit these plateaus where you just kind of your progress flattens out. So he's hitting one of those plateaus and here's what he says. He says, Arnold, I asked myself over and over, what can you do to be special and different? I finally arrived at the idea of shocking the muscles.

{"text": "s hitting one of those plateaus and here ' s what he says . He says , Arnold , I asked myself over and over , what can you do to be special and different ? I finally arrived at the idea of shocking the muscles . If you do Arnold Schwarzenegger: 10 sets of bench press or any other exercise regularly for a year, the muscles gradually get used to 10 sets of bench press and the growth slows down. So once a week I took a training partner and drove out into the country with the weights. We limited ourselves to one exercise for a particular body part. I remember for the first day, we carried 250 pounds out into the forest and did squats for three hours straight. I began by doing 20 repetitions with 250 pounds. Then my partner did whatever he could. Then it was my turn again. We ended up doing something like 55 sets of squats each. The last hour seemed endless. But it worked. Our thighs pumped up like balloons. That first day, we gave our thigh muscles such a shock that we couldn't walk right for a week. We barely could crawl. Our legs had never experienced anything as tough as those 55 sets. And each of us put something like an eighth or a quarter of an inch on our thighs. They just blew up. They had no chance to survive. And so, you know, with this, he breaks through that plateau and his physique is just blown up. And he wants to have everything locked, everything dialed. And sure enough, when Mr. Universe comes around in 1967, he feels supremely confident. Victory is on the tip of his tongue, just out of reach. He felt confident and prepared enough that he's not just worrying about his own performance. He's trying to psych out his competitors. His main opponent asks him how he's doing and he responds fantastic It's the kind of day when you know, you're going to win But he's so psyched up that he can't sleep the night before the competition begins He's so tired on the day of the competition that he takes a nap In the middle of the day and he wakes up to someone pounding on his hotel door judging has already begun If he's not downstairs and on stage in 10 minutes, he'll be disqualified. So he jumps up and runs downstairs and has to go straight on stage. Now, bodybuilders pump themselves up before competing. Literally. If you've never lifted weights before, there's something called the pump. And that is when you lift weights, the blood flows to your muscles, uh, when you're working out, which causes them to expand. You can literally see your muscles getting bigger. As you're working out, so", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/arnold-schwarzenegger", "title": "Arnold Schwarzenegger", "chunk_index": 11, "publication_date": "2024-03-21", "total_chunks_in_doc": 26}}
{"text": "the pump . And that is when you lift weights , the blood flows to your muscles , uh , when you ' re working out , which causes them to expand . You can literally see your muscles getting bigger . As you ' re working out , so Arnold Schwarzenegger: every bodybuilder before they go on stage is lifting weights, doing push ups, doing everything they can to get their blood pumping and their muscles expanded to look as big and buff as possible. Coming into a competition cold is a huge disadvantage. But Arnold, you know, he just woke up. He has no time to pump, but he isn't worried. He says he had begun to get what he calls the feeling of magnificence. I just, I love that the feeling of magnificence. It's this supreme feeling of confidence that you have, that nothing can go wrong, that you're just bound to win. He watches as others pose. There are a lot of great bodies, some very impressive muscles, but nothing that overawes him, nothing that he doesn't think he can beat. The competition was run according to height, and Arnold was pretty tall, 6'2 so he went last. He steps on the stage and starts posing. Here's how he describes what happened. When I hit my first arm pose, the place fell apart. Everybody started roaring. I swept into a back pose and the same thing happened. I had people screaming and whistling and hollering. I finished off with the most muscular pose. Everybody started applauding and applauding and going crazy. Usually at the prejudging, applause is not allowed because it might influence the judges. But the people couldn't hold themselves back. The next day, when he poses for an audience, the reception is even more enthusiastic, and he is called back on stage for an encore. He wins the competition and is Mr. Universe. At 20 years old, Arnold Schwarzenegger was already the greatest and best bodybuilder in the world. Only he wasn't. As he soon discovered, there were overlapping governing bodies that administered different bodybuilding contests. Arnold was something of a provincial at this point in his career, and wasn't totally aware of the wider world of bodybuilding. And he was only now learning that there were other competitions, and that those winners also had a claim on the title of best bodybuilder. If he wanted to be the undisputed greatest bodybuilder in the world, he would need to go to America, And win a separate Mr. Universe contest and win Mr. Olympia, another building competition that was, once again, run by a different governing body. As he learned about the bodybuilders who had won those contests, especially two guys, one named Frank Zane and another one named Sergio Oliva, he saw that their physiques truly were", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/arnold-schwarzenegger", "title": "Arnold Schwarzenegger", "chunk_index": 12, "publication_date": "2024-03-21", "total_chunks_in_doc": 26}}
{"text": "another building competition that was , once again , run by a different governing body . As he learned about the bodybuilders who had won those contests , especially two guys , one named Frank Zane and another one named Sergio Oliva , he saw that their physiques truly were Arnold Schwarzenegger: amazing. And he wasn't necessarily ahead of where they were. He would need to up his game if he wanted to defeat them. He went back to Munich where he worked out with his training partner, Franco Colombo, and where he now owned and managed the gym that he worked out at. He used the publicity from his win at Mr. Universe to publicize his gym and get more members. He really wanted to break through to the non gym going public. As I said, most people thought that Weightlifting was weird and like, um, in some ways kind of sinister. So everyone who lifted weights in Munich already knew his gym. There were only like two or three gyms for weightlifting at. But he wanted to get through to everyone else. And so he comes up with an ingenious way to do it. From Total Recall he writes, But Albert came up with an idea. If we had asked the newspapers to write a story about me winning Mr. Universe, they'd have thought we were nuts. Instead, he had me walk around the city on a freezing day in my posing briefs. Then he called some of his newspaper friends and said, You remember Schwarzenegger who won the stone lifting contest? Well now he's Mr. Universe, and he's at Stackis Square in his underwear. A couple of editors thought that was funny enough to send photographers. I led them all over the city, from the market to the Hauptbundhof, where I made a point of chatting up little old ladies to show I was friendly and nice and not some kind of monster. This is what politicians do all the time, but it was very unusual for a bodybuilder. In spite of the cold, I was having fun. The next morning, a picture ran in one of the papers of me and my briefs at a construction site where one of the workers, who was all bundled up against the cold, was gawking at me in amazement. And this works. Um, it makes a big splash in the newspaper and it gets a lot of people who otherwise wouldn't have been interested saying, okay, what is this with weightlifting? This guy looks great. And more people start coming to the gym. Now in 1969, he flies out to America to compete against Oliva and Zane, and he comes up short. He comes in second against both of them. And he has to admit that the judges are right. He doesn't just lose. Uh, he loses because.

{"text": "to compete against Oliva and Zane , and he comes up short . He comes in second against both of them . And he has to admit that the judges are right . He doesn ' t just lose . Uh , he loses because . They are better than Arnold Schwarzenegger: him. They have better physiques. He's very honest with himself about that. And, again, that is one of the major themes. Always be honest with yourself about where your strengths and weaknesses lie. He decides that if he wants to be able to beat Zayn and Oliva, he needs every advantage. He needs to up his game. And the best way to up his game was to go where the action was. The place where he had always wanted to end up. Arnold was headed to America. Musical cue. When Arnold first showed up to Los Angeles, he was a little bit disappointed. He thought everything was supposed to be bigger in America. But there were few skyscrapers in LA, Hollywood was just a bunch of walled off lots, you couldn't see the movies being made, and Gold's Gym, the bodybuilding mecca of the world, was just a dingy little weight room. After overcoming this initial shock, Arnold quickly fell in love with California, a love affair that would last right up until the present. The sunny weather matched his cheerful disposition, people were friendly, open, and helpful, quite unlike Austria. The place really was quite free. You didn't have the same kind of suffocating regulations and controls and social expectations like you had back in Austria either. Despite the weather, Arnold spent most of his time indoors, working out. One of the things he had become famous for were his splits. He would do one three hour workout in the morning and then a second one in the evening. He's training so hard that he has professional bodybuilders with him at both workouts, and that is their only workout for the day. So he is literally working out about twice as much as other professional bodybuilders. When 1970 comes around, the three competitions that he needs to win to be the undisputed bodybuilding champion are within a few weeks of each other. Mr. Universe, Mr. World, and Mr. Olympia. They're back to back to back. And as I mentioned earlier, one thing that Arnold was great at was that he would be so prepared and dialed in that he didn't have to worry about himself at the last minute. He knew he was ready to go. So he could worry about competing. He could look at the other bodybuilders, try to psych them out, try to match their energy, their strategy, their posing, whatever. I think this is best illustrated by what he did to Sergio Oliva at Mr. World in 1970.

They are way ahead of everyone else, so they have what's called a pose off. The judges ask the two of them to pose next to each other so that they can get a more direct comparison. Here's how Arnold describes, uh, what happened next. He said, we were exhausted. That's when I went in for the kill. An idea came into my head. I said to Sergio, I've had it. I think those guys ought to know now. However, the chips fall. He said, yeah, you're right. He walked off one side of the stage and I started to walk off the other, but I walked only two steps. Then I stopped and hit another pose. And I turned toward the side and shrugged as if to say, Where'd he go? Sergio came right back on stage a little confused, but by this time, Arnold was the only name they were chanting, and some of the fans were even booing him. I used the moment to execute my best professional posing and shots. Then it was over the judges held a little meeting backstage and the MC came out and announced that I was the new mr Olympia Sergio never said anything to me about how I'd mocked him, but he told other people he felt he'd been had That's not how I saw it. It was a primal moment I'd finished him off by instinct in the heat of a competition that I dominated by then all the same So he wins that competition and he completes the trifecta in 1970. He goes boom. Boom. Boom. Mr. Universe. Mr World and mr. Olympia And he is now, after having won those three competitions, the undisputed bodybuilding champion of the world. And at this point, he feels like he has proven just about everything he needs to prove. And he wants to pivot toward the next great goal in his life. Just like Reg Park, he wants to become a great actor. Now, over the next ten years, this would be a slow pivot. He still competed at Mr. Olympia, which he would win six more times.

And actually try and give him offers for he was always being asked to Arnold Schwarzenegger: play villains, Nazi guards, you know, things like that. And a big part of that is his Austrian accent, which despite years of classes, he was unable to fully shake and has still been unable to fully shake. As you probably know, it's during this time that one of Hollywood's most famous actresses, Lucille Ball gives Arnold some really interesting advice. She says, Arnold, when someone tells you, no, you should just hear. Yes. And he takes that to heart. When people tell him no, he just acts like they told him yes. And that's a technique that works in ingratiating himself to the Hollywood crowd. Because he's hearing no a lot, and yet somehow, he keeps moving closer and closer to the inner circles of the film business. He hires an agent who believes in him as a leading man, and refuses to compromise for him. He's not going to do anything that will get him typecast as a bit part actor or as a villain. He's got an interesting quote about this. Arnold says, it's easier to stand out when you aim straight for the top, which I think is a very interesting point. And luckily he's got the freedom to be choosy. Because he has a few side businesses. One is a mail order business that sells instructional weightlifting tapes. He and his Italian buddy, Franco Colombo start a bricklaying company as well. Um, I think it's really interesting their strategy. Here's what Arnold says about it. He said, I said to Franco, why don't we just start our own company? Franco knew bricklaying and I knew business. So that's what we did. We put an ad in the newspaper that said European bricklayers. Frank and I had noticed that Americans loved foreign names. Swedish massages, Italian design, Chinese herbs, German ingenuity. We decided that we should highlight being European. The fact that Franco was Italian was especially good. And one of the reasons that they do this, that he gets into bricklaying, is that it allows him to work out while he's making money. You know, bricklaying is very physical. You're doing lots of lifting and, um, and swinging when you're doing demolition with a big hammer. So he is getting more fit as he is working and making money. And the European marketing angle is genius. And the business does quite well for as long as he needs it to. He also invests", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/arnold-schwarzenegger", "title": "Arnold Schwarzenegger", "chunk_index": 16, "publication_date": "2024-03-21", "total_chunks_in_doc": 26}}

And the business does quite well for as long as he needs it to . He also invests Arnold Schwarzenegger: in an apartment complex and he starts investing more and more in real estate, especially in Santa Monica, which at the time was not very nice. It's kind of a rundown part of the L. A. area, but is now one of the nicest places in Southern California and one of the most expensive places on earth. So these investments do really well for him. But even while he's investing and doing all these businesses, he's also turning down any opportunities that don't fit into his master plan. For example, he's offered a job managing a leading gym chain for 200, 000 a year, uh, for this fitness guru Jack LaLanne, um, and 200, 000 a year, a lot of money now. It was a ton of money back in the 1970s, uh, but it would have taken all his time and wouldn't have left anything over for trying to make it as an actor. And so he says no, and he doesn't manage this gym chain. His first big break in terms of acting comes when a documentary is produced called Pumping Iron. Arnold is essentially the main character and definitely the breakout star. It's a pretty simple, straightforward documentary that is just trying to expose the wider public to this world of the sport of bodybuilding. But it's well done by a couple of talented filmmakers. And even though he isn't acting per se, you can see that Arnold is a natural in front of the camera. And as he goes around the country promoting the film, he gets to know other actors, directors, people who are involved in the movie business. So, a director named John Milius sees this movie, Pumping Iron, and he thinks that Arnold would be great on his upcoming film, Conan the Barbarian. He's looking for someone who can embody the physicality of Conan, who was a comic book character, who's supposed to be this tough, massive, sword swinging hero. And Conan is a weird story, it's a weird movie. It's set in the distant past during a time and place that you can't totally locate in history. And so Arnold's accent Isn't a problem at all because you know, it's this weird time unplaceable. So who knows what accents they might have back then There are a lot of concerns from the studio about this movie Conan the Barbarian They think it might not sell well because it's really violent very bloody Arnold takes", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/arnold-schwarzenegger", "title": "Arnold Schwarzenegger", "chunk_index": 17, "publication_date": "2024-03-21", "total_chunks_in_doc": 26}}

So he wants to help sell it. The studio wants to send him on a press tour internationally, but they wanna send him to just France and Italy, which is kind of standard for the time. But he manages to convince them that, hey, there are more European countries than just France and Italy. And there are more people that could see this movie, and so he convinces them to send him to six countries, more than they had planned. And he's the only actor they have who is pressing them to do more promotion work. And this is really smart for Arnold. You know, you don't get paid for doing the press tour. So most actors think, Why would I want to do this? Why would I want to do free work? I already got paid for the movie. So, you know, I have to do this as a Commitment to the contract but I'm not gonna do more than I'm getting paid for but Arnold is thinking that if this movie does well That will elevate him as a bankable star and he'll get more opportunities And he couldn't have been more right. Conan is a huge hit in part because of his massive promotional efforts. There are lines around the block to see it at the movie theaters across the country. And it's the one film that flips Arnold from a nobody actor to a star. Of course, the fact that his follow up film was The Terminator also helps. And this part of Arnold's life is crazy. He's still training for hours every day. He still occasionally competes. His last bodybuilding competition is in 1980. Uh, he's acting. He's got more and more real estate holdings. He takes courses at the local community college to improve his business knowledge and his English. He's got more fitness businesses. But he said, He was never tired out by all of this. He loves it. He had a passion for work. He has a quote that I love. He said, so for me, work just meant discovery and fun. If I heard somebody complaining, Oh, I work so hard. I put in 10 and 12 hours days.

What the hell are you talking about ? When the day is 24 Arnold Schwarzenegger: hours? What else did you do? He said, everything I did could have been my hobby. It was my hobby in a way. I was passionate about all of it. My definition of living is to have excitement always. That's the difference between living and existing. Later, when I learned about the Terminator, I loved that idea that he was a machine that never had to sleep. I said to myself, imagine what an advantage that would be to have those extra 6 hours every day for something else. Imagine you could study a whole new profession, you could learn an instrument. That would be unbelievable, because for me, the question was always how to fit in all the stuff I want to do. But like I said, his run of movies in the 80s is legendary. He produces some truly great movies, and his goal was to keep doubling his pay Which he manages to do for quite a while. He has paid 250, 000 for Conan the Barbarian, and then 750, 000 for Terminator, 1, 000, 000 for Conan the Destroyer, 1. 5 million for Commando, 3 million for Predator, 5 million for Running Man, 10 million for Total Recall, and then 15 million, uh, when he acts in a movie called True Lies. So in a decade, he more than 50Xs his pay per movie. In the late 80s, Arnold decides that, just like bodybuilding, he's kind of proved what he needs to prove as an action star and wants to show a different side of himself. So, he pivots to comedy. Even though he had proven all the doubters wrong with becoming an action star, once again, Hollywood producers are really reluctant to bet on Arnold as a comedic actor. And so, for his first movie, which is called Twins, he and his co star, Danny DeVito, have to pitch in and help finance the movie. And as a consequence, they get paid residuals. So, whenever the movie makes money, they get a cut of that revenue. And so once again, the film is a huge hit. And so Twins, even though it was far from his biggest movie, is actually the movie that Arnold has made by far the most money from. It's estimated that he made over 35 million from Twins, and he continues to make money on it to this day. So there's definitely something to be said for betting on yourself, which is what Arnold does here. Arnold bets on himself again when the opportunity comes", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/arnold-schwarzenegger", "title": "Arnold Schwarzenegger", "chunk_index": 19, "publication_date": "2024-03-21", "total_chunks_in_doc": 26}}

So there ' s definitely something to be said for betting on yourself , which is what Arnold does here . Arnold bets on himself again when the opportunity comes Arnold Schwarzenegger: to run for governor in 2003. I won't get into the full history here of his governorship. Um, he had prominently supported Republicans in the past, especially George H. W. Bush. He actually chaired the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports under Bush from 1990 to 1993. He ran for governor of California as a moderate Republican who was fiscally conservative, kind of common sense, but socially more lax. And this appealed in a state that had been mismanaged under its previous administration. He was elected, and at first he pushes through some really important legislation that helps to balance California's books, and it looked like he's going to be really successful. But then he tries to take on The public unions and basically California had promised these really cushy pensions to all sorts of public employees. Uh, these retirement benefits that were just really, really generous. And it was actually driving the state broke. And it actually still is. And you can't get the legislature to do that. To pass a bill, uh, to limit these really cushy retirement packages, uh, because the, the congressmen in Utah are kind of really beholden to these public unions. And, uh, and so he decides to put it as a ballot initiative. And in California, getting things passed through the legislature isn't the only way to pass laws. You can actually have the public vote on it. And so Arnold decides, all right, I can't get the legislature. I can't get the California Congress to work with me. I'm going to bypass them. Okay. And, um, and put it to a vote. So Arnold puts this ballot initiative out. And the problem is he was doing the right thing, or he was trying to, by targeting all public employees equally. Um, for all of them, he was saying, you can't have this retirement package, uh, that are this generous and we're going to make this, you know, fair across the board. And so this included teachers and public administrators who tend to be Democrats, as well as policemen and firefighters who tend to be Republicans. So all public employees in California. We're going to cut these retirement packages and benefit packages. And the result is he doesn't really have a base of support. You know, you've got the liberal side that that's attacking him, you know, all these public administrators, all these teachers who tend to come", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/arnold-schwarzenegger", "title": "Arnold Schwarzenegger", "chunk_index": 20, "publication_date": "2024-03-21", "total_chunks_in_doc": 26}}

The union spend hundreds of millions of dollars in TV ads that just crucify Arnold and again, this is coming from both sides. So it's making it seem. Like a bipartisan attack on Arnold. So the average voter is going, Well, this must be a bad idea because Democrats hate it and Republicans hate it. And so the initiative fails. And his job approval rating goes from over 50 percent down into the low 20s. And it looks like his governorship is over just as it was getting started. But, um, he does a smart move when this fails, he's embarrassed. It looks like his, his political prospects are in the toilet. He appears on TV and he's humble. He says, Hey, message received my bad. I'm going to try to work on bipartisan stuff. And I'm going to work on common sense things that improve the lives of Californians. I'm going to stay away from controversial stuff for the time being. And so he essentially pivots and decides to govern as a moderate Democrat rather than a moderate Republican, which is obviously much easier to do in California, which is heavily Democratic. And he's able to get more stuff accomplished, more stuff passed. He even gets a new chief of staff who was known as a liberal, like a pretty far left person to help him be able to work more successfully with Democrats. And this works to bounce back his approvals. He wins re election and had what can be described as a fairly successful tenure as governor, at least by California standards. For those of you who live outside the U S and might not know the reputation of California, which is where I grew up is, you know, it's an amazing place. It's one of the most beautiful places in the United States. It's one of the most beautiful places in the world. And it's really dynamic economically. It's got Hollywood, it's got Silicon Valley, Los Angeles, San Francisco, some of the great cities in the world. It's also got some of the best farmland in the world, which not many people know. I mean, it has a ton going for it.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/arnold-schwarzenegger", "title": "Arnold Schwarzenegger", "chunk_index": 21, "publication_date": "2024-03-21", "total_chunks_in_doc": 26}}
{"text": "got Silicon Valley , Los Angeles , San Francisco , some of the great cities in the world . It ' s also got some of the best farmland in the world , which not many people know . I mean , it has a ton going for it . Arnold Schwarzenegger: It's incredible place, but. It also has a reputation for almost comical mismanagement. It costs billions of dollars to get anything done. The public infrastructure is bad. You know, the trains, the metro systems are really dirty and gross. The infrastructure is crumbling. It's unbelievably corrupt. The social services are inept. The public schools are often horrible. The government is just known. As very bad in California. And so was Arnold able to magically turn that into an efficient and effective bureaucracy? No, no, he wasn't. But did it function a little better than it did before and a little better than it did after? Yeah, I would say it did. And in the public perception, I think that's true. So in that way, I would say he was a successful governor. Anyway, as his tenure as governor was ending, a scandal rocked Arnold's world. His wife found out that he had fathered a son with their housekeeper. Arnold had never acknowledged the child and he had never told his wife about the affair. But as the boy grew into a teenager, I mean, you can look up the pictures. It's actually kind of darkly funny how much the kid looks like his dad. And so his wife. He sees this kid walking around with their housekeeper who looks just like Arnold, and she figures out what's going on, she confronts him on it, he admits it, his wife files for divorce, and now, just as he was ending his tenure in politics, Hollywood studios no longer wanted to work with him because he was so toxic. Uh, because of the scandal. So he had to cool his heels for a few years while people, um, kind of waited for this to settle. In the recent past, he has focused more on his motivational content and building his fitness newsletter. And after a few years, he has finally got back into acting in movies. So I know that's kind of an anti climax to a story, but you know, so it goes sometimes. And who knows, maybe Arnold will surprise us. Your late seventies. Is not the easiest time to reinvent yourself, but if anyone is capable of it, I would say Arnold is so that's the story. So what were my big takeaways from this episode from the life of Arnold Schwarzenegger? The first is just what I said about vision.

{"text": "so that ' s the story . So what were my big takeaways from this episode from the life of Arnold Schwarzenegger ? The first is just what I said about vision . When you have a strong vision , the world conspires to help you achieve it . But Arnold Schwarzenegger: it's got to be very clear. According to Arnold, it should literally be a vision. You should be able to see it. And you've got to be able to articulate it. And of course, you've also got to work like crazy for it. The next thing, and this is something he talked about a lot, is concentration. There's one story that I talked about briefly that demonstrates these two things together. Vision and concentration, and that is when he has offered 200, 000 to run a chain of health clubs on behalf of Jack LaLanne. And here's what Arnold said about it. I like this quote. He said, Being a national spokesman for a health club franchise was not part of my vision. I didn't think it was embarrassing or beneath me or anything like that. Jack LaLanne was a hero to anyone who cared about physical fitness. The problem was that accepting his offer would prevent me from doing movies. Which is where my vision was taking me by this point in my bodybuilding career knowing that made saying no very easy I was comfortable with the idea of turning down all that money and the different type of fame the job would bring I was calm Knowing that I just sidestepped something that was also an amazing opportunity, but a big distraction Okay, so having that vision helps keep you from getting distracted. It helps you concentrate helps you focus on what matters most Other things I took away. One is that quote from Lucille Ball. When someone tells you no, you should hear yes. I just think that's such a powerful way to approach the world. And along with that, Arnold is a big believer in positive thinking, in always having a positive attitude. I love how he described that feeling of magnificence. If you want people to get on board with your vision, You need to come across as positive and confident. Some other ideas. One is it's easier to stand out when you aim straight for the top. That's a great quote from Arnold. This is an idea that I've heard Tim Ferriss talk about too, which is that less ambitious companies aren't necessarily less risky. Like you're going to have to put in the work and accept a high chance of failure no matter what you're working on. So you might as well work on something with huge upside, enormous potential. It also reminds me of the Jim Carrey quote, and he talked about his dad who had loved comedy, but had gone", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/arnold-schwarzenegger", "title": "Arnold Schwarzenegger", "chunk_index": 23, "publication_date": "2024-03-21", "total_chunks_in_doc": 26}}

It also reminds me of the Jim Carrey quote , and he talked about his dad who had loved comedy , but had gone Arnold Schwarzenegger: to be an accountant because it was safer, and he got fired as an accountant. And so Jim Carrey said, you can fail at what you don't want. So you might as well take a chance on doing what you do love. You might fail even if your goals are modest. So you might as well take a chance by aiming for what you really want. It's easier to stand out when you aim straight for the top, you know, and then this is one of the last things I'll say. A lot of Arnold's advice reminds me of a scene from one of my favorite movies, master and commander. And the protagonist, Captain Jack Aubrey, is talking about a time when he had met Lord Nelson, a very famous old British admiral, on the deck of his ship. And it's a cold night and he offers Lord Nelson a coat. And Lord Nelson says, no, I am quite warm. My zeal for king and country keep me warm. And so this is like touching, but kind of cliche. And so someone scoffs at this and Captain Aubrey says, I know it sounds absurd. And were it from another man, you'd cry out, oh, what pitiful stuff. And dismiss it as mere enthusiasm. But with Nelson, you felt your heart glow. And that is kind of how I feel about Arnold Schwarzenegger. Some of the advice he gives is sort of like roll your eyes, stock motivational advice. Uh, for example, I picked out a few quotes from his books. Uh, one is work works. That's the bottom line. No matter what you do, no matter who you are, my entire life has been shaped by that single idea. Another one is pain only needs to have meaning to you. For it to be bearable another. He says, let me put it another way. Busyness is bullshit. We're all busy. We all have things to do every day. Obligations and responsibilities. We all have to eat, sleep, pay the bills. What does that have to do with putting in the work to reach your vision? If it matters to you, do it. Make the time. Uh, another one failure has never killed a dream. Quitting kills every dream. It touches one last one. Turn your TV off, throw your machines out the window, save your excuses for someone who cares, get to work. So like, this is pretty cliche, just like work hard.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/arnold-schwarzenegger", "title": "Arnold Schwarzenegger", "chunk_index": 24, "publication_date": "2024-03-21", "total_chunks_in_doc": 26}}
{"text": "dream . Quitting kills every dream . It touches one last one . Turn your TV off , throw your machines out the window , save your excuses for someone who cares , get to work . So like , this is pretty cliche , just like work hard . Arnold Schwarzenegger: Okay. Novel strategy, Arnold, but just like captain Aubrey, I like hearing it from Arnold. He is so obviously sincere, he's full of enthusiasm, and he's got credibility from what he accomplished. And so, yeah, like, I know you have to work hard, but somehow hearing Arnold say it, and the way he says it, and the stories, Uh, that he tells with it, like just kind of helps it sink in, in a different way and helps me grasp some of these kind of simple concepts in a more profound way where I can start to envision how exactly this will apply to my life and exactly what I need to do to succeed. This is especially true for me. In the education of a bodybuilder, his first autobiography, which is one of my all time favorite books. And I recommend to anyone. So anyway, all this is to say, I guess none of these takeaways are super revolutionary, but the story and the writing of Arnold Schwarzenegger really brought them home to me. And hopefully this episode has at least somewhat done the same for you. Find that vision, find that thing you love, that obsession, be able to see it, to envision it, be able to articulate it. And then work for it. And as you do, people around you will help you. They will literally conspire to help you succeed. The universe will bend to your iron will. So that's it for this episode.

{"text": "Catherine the Great: This week you are getting a mini-episode on Catherine the Great. ‚Äç And I wanted to talk about Catherine, first because I‚Äôve been reading about her and I find her life interesting, but also because she embodies a very interesting attribute that is different than many of the men I have talked about on this podcast: Adaptability. ‚Äç When you think about Napoleon or Steve Jobs or Vladimir Putin‚Ä¶ many of these men attained such fabulous levels of success specifically because they were not flexible. They forced the world to adapt to them and their vision of the way things should be. ‚Äç But Catherine took a much different approach. She was a chameleon who could adapt to any circumstance. And she was able to accomplish just as much as anyone else with this approach. So let‚Äôs dig into her story a little. ‚Äç If you were to ask someone what they know about Catherine the Great, the one thing most people would tell you about her is that she‚Äôs Russian. And that‚Äôs probably it. Well, it turns out that the one that that one thing that they know about her is wrong. ‚Äç She was actually born Princess Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst, in the German kingdom of Prussia. So how did she end up as Catherine the Great of Russia? ‚Äç When Sophie was in her early teens, the tsarina, or empress, of Russia at the time, was a woman by the name of Elizabeth. She had no children, and so when she died the crown was going to pass to her nephew. He too was born in Prussia, in the city of Kiel, and his birth name was Charles Peter Ulrich of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp, but he would later go by Peter at the Russian court, since Ulrich isn‚Äôt exactly Russian sounding. ‚Äç The only problem was this Peter guy was a total weirdo. He was an alcoholic by the age of 10, he was sickly, reclusive, childish, aloof, and temperamental. ‚Äç But Sophie and her family didn‚Äôt know any of this, and when Elizabeth proposed that Catherine be betrothed to Peter, her parents jumped at the opportunity. After all, creep or no creep, it‚Äôs not every day that your child gets the chance to become a czarina. ‚Äç So Peter and Sophie get engaged, and they show up to the royal court in St Petersburg and re-start their lives there, and their reactions could not be more different.

{"text": "engaged , and they show up to the royal court in St Petersburg and re - start their lives there , and their reactions could not be more different . Peter freaks out . He hates it in Russia . Germany in general , and Prussia specifically , was really Catherine the Great: the center of European culture during that era. This was the time of Bach and Leibniz, and luminaries like Joseph Haydn and Immanuel Kant were born in Germany around the same time as Sophie and Peter. But Russia could not have been more different. It was considered a backwater. There were not a lot of famous musicians and philosophers being born in Russia at the time. ‚Äç And so when Peter has to make this move, he acts about how you might expect. He grumbles and he pines for home and talks about how awesome Prussia is all the time. He‚Äôs really slow to learn the Russian language, in fact even by the end of his life it was said that he could barely speak passable Russian. He‚Äôs reclusive and keeps himself aloof of the day-to-day events of the palace. ‚Äç Sophie, on the other hand, learns quickly and is hyper-adaptable. She fully embraces her new home. She came to Russia in 1744, at the age of 15, and she converts to Russian Orthodoxy, changes her name to Catherine because it was a thoroughly Russian name whereas Sophie was not, she learns the Russian language, and immediately starts making friends and establishing connections in the Russian court. ‚Äç Not only was she adaptable, but she had natural gifts as well. Catherine was tall, intelligent, and beautiful. And not beautiful in a dainty way, but in a larger-than-life kind of way. She rather looked like an empress, and that probably helped her along the way. Listen to this description from a French visitor to St. Petersburg: ‚Äç ‚ÄúHer figure is noble and agreeably impressive; her gait majestic, her person and deportment graceful in the highest degree. Her air is that of a sovereign. Every feature proclaims a superior character. her mouth is sweetly fresh, and embellished by a singularly regular and beautiful set of teeth, the chin somewhat plump, and rather inclining to double, but without the smallest tendency to fatness. Her hair is chestnut-coloured, the eyes hazel, and extremely fascinating. her complexion is dazzlingly clear. Loftiness is the true character of her physiognomy, taken as a whole.‚Äù ‚Äç Catherine and Peter were married in August of 1745, and it was a pretty messed up relationship from the start. They frequently disagreed and fought, and Catherine would even later claim that they never consummated their marriage. This was almost certainly not true, but it lets you know what she thought of the guy that she would claim it. ‚Äç Things get even worse when the Czarina,", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/catherine-the-great", "title": "Catherine the Great", "chunk_index": 1, "publication_date": "2019-10-11", "total_chunks_in_doc": 5}}

This was almost certainly not true , but it lets you know what she thought of the guy that she would claim it . ‚Äç Things get even worse when the Czarina , Catherine the Great: Elizabeth, dies and Peter becomes Czar of Russia in 1762. ‚Äç At the time, Russia was allied with Austria and France against Prussia in the Seven Years War. And Peter didn‚Äôt like that, remember he was from Prussia and he loved Prussia, he still openly spoke about how awesome Prussia was and how much he missed it. Peter openly spoke at court about the superiority of Prussia and the German way of life, which as you might imagine, the Russian nobles didn‚Äôt love. ‚Äç The king of Prussia, Frederick the Great was his idol. He probably had Frederick the Great posters up on his wall. ‚Äç Well, Peter became Czar just as the war against Prussia was going well for Russia. The Prussians had suffered heavy casualties and in spite of certain key victories, Frederick was losing badly. Russian dragoons even occupied Berlin for a period of time. ‚Äç But the last thing Peter wanted was for his new army to destroy the guy that he still fanboyed over. And so, not only did Peter offer peace to Frederick, he actually offered an alliance to Prussia. And at the cost of nothing. The Prussian territories that Russian men had fought and died over were immediately turned back over to the Prussians. ‚Äç I mean people accuse President Trump of having pro-Russian sympathies. But imagine if Trump was born in Russia, his birth name was actually Ivan Donald Medvedev, he barely spoke English and spoke it with a heavy Russian accent, he was openly saying that he wished our society was more Russian, that he preferred the Russian way of life, and then the first thing he did as president was give Alaska back to Russia. It wouldn‚Äôt go over well, to say the least. And that‚Äôs basically what‚Äôs going on here with Peter and it is NOT going over well, especially with the Russian nobles. ‚Äç Peace was struck between the Russians and Prussians, but there was anything but peace in St. Petersburg, where the Russian nobles were seething at the decision Peter had just made. ‚Äç Catherine was now Empress Consort, but because Peter spent most of his time at his preferred residence, which was secluded outside of St Petersburg, Catherine was the one who actually had more contact with the movers and shakers of the political scene. ‚Äç Peter‚Äôs unpopularity grew each week, especially among the nobility and the Church.

Peter ‚Äô s open distaste for the Russian Orthodox Church alienated Church officials . And he managed to offend Catherine the Great: one more important group: the rank and file soldiers of the army. ‚Äç The Izmailovsky Regiment was an elite group of royal guards stationed in the capital, and per Peter‚Äôs Prussian obsession, he redesigned their uniforms from their traditional Russian green to Prussian blue. This was considered a great insult to their honor. And this was an insane own-goal. There was no good reason for it. So now he‚Äôs surrounded by people who hate him: the aristocracy, the church, the soldiers, and last but certainly not least, his wife. ‚Äç He openly humiliated Catherine in public, especially in court. In one particular incident, he called Catherine a fool in front of dozens of uncomfortable on-lookers. The word echoed in the hall as no one spoke. Catherine burst into tears, unable to bear the public humiliation. In a letter to her friend, Catherine said that every insult that her husband shot at her would never be forgotten or forgiven. So she did what any upset wife would do, she plotted a coup to overthrow him. ‚Äç Catherine was quickly becoming convinced that her husband was a disaster as Tsar. By July 1762, Catherine and her court favorites had hatched a plot to overthrow Peter, which again, is pretty easy to do because he‚Äôs never actually at court, he‚Äôs in some palace outside of town. ‚Äç Having said that, Peter actually does find out about the conspiracy before it begins. One of his German-born agents arrests a conspirator and gets him to reveal the whole thing. ‚Äç But he doesn‚Äôt do anything about it. His response to this is to personally go search for Catherine at their residence. ‚Äç Catherine, on the other hand, springs into action as soon as she finds out that Peter has discovered her plan. This was an unexpected turn of events that threw her entire plan for a loop. The plan was not ready. But remember, one of Catherine‚Äôs key skills is adaptability. She immediately jumps into action. She visits the Izmailovsky Regiment, which is basically an elite regiment of guards for the royal family, and addresses them. ‚Äç What happens next is one of the most famous episodes in the life of Catherine the Great. Standing before the Regiment, Catherine told a story of a treacherous husband who threatened his innocent wife with bodily harm.

Tall, beautiful, and extremely gifted on horseback, she reveled in the fact that she cut a more imposing military figure than her feeble husband. And this is in the 1700s in Russia. ‚Äç Soon after the soldiers pledged their loyalty to Catherine, the Orthodox Bishops quickly hailed her as the rightful heir to the throne. And that just about sealed it. And so, on July 9th, 1762, Catherine was declared Tsarina of the Russian Empire. ‚Äç As Tsarina, she would expand Russian territory through war and conquest, enact reforms in art, education, health, and government, and transform Russia into a modern European state and one of the great world powers. ‚Äç Her two great twin attributes were ambition and flexibility. This combination allowed her to take advantage of the opportunities that were presented to her and deftly deal with any obstacles or setbacks that arose. ‚Äç Born the German-Lutheran Sophie, she made her name as Tsarina Catherine of Russia, protector of Orthodox Christians.

{"text": "The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World: Hello and welcome to how to take over the world. This is Ben Wilson. This is the Caesar guide to taking over the world. This is an episode about Julius Caesar. I read a new book on him recently. Not a new book, new to me. It's actually a very old book written in the 1800s. It's called Caesar a Sketch. It's called Caesar a Sketch. By James Anthony Froud. So this episode is me using a new source as an excuse to revisit Caesar, unpack his playbook a little bit more and talk about what made him so great and what I have learned from his life. If you want the blow by blow of, you know, going into his campaigns and exactly what happened, more detail, you can go back and listen to the four episodes series I did on Caesar. The one in which I mispronounce Pompey as Pompey the entire time. I'm sure I'll mispronounce other names in this episode. But Caesar is worth revisiting because his life is so extraordinary. To me, he is probably the second greatest or at least most impactful figure in human history right there behind Jesus. I think I'd put at number one. Caesar, you know, one of the facts that I love about him is his name becomes synonymous with emperor essentially. And so that gets translated as Kaiser in German and as czar in Slavic languages. So you can see it, his name was actually Kaiser is how they pronounced it back in the day. So you go from Kaiser to czar, czar, czar. Um, and so someone held the title of Caesar, was trying to carry on his legacy. Until 1946. Okay, that was the last Caesar. His name was Simeon II. He was a czar in Bulgaria, I believe. But that's extraordinary. I mean, you just think about it. And no one has that level of impact and notoriety over 2000 years. I really can't think of a comparable figure you know, people, when they talk about our current political situation in the United States and elsewhere, they still reference the Roman Republic, the Roman Empire, they reference Caesar and a lot of the events in his lifetime.

It wasn ' t just an accident that he ' s had a legacy The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World: that's lasted this long. He was a great general. He was a great politician. He was a great statesman and he was a great writer, which is something I don't think a lot of people know, but he was acknowledged by the greatest writer of his era, Cicero, as , you know, someone who he looked to as a peer in the field of writing. So this is someone who was a true genius and a master across multiple fields. Uh, others took over the Roman state before him. Uh, you had dictators like Sina, Marius, Sulla, the Gracchi brothers. And yet none of them established the legacy. Rome was very impressive at the time, but there's no reason that it should have continued to last for hundreds of years after Caesar. In fact, it was arguably in a death spiral before Caesar arrived, and it should have fallen apart. And instead we get the Roman Empire, which is one of the great political entities of all time. And so I think what Caesar did is one of the great accomplishments of all time. And there's just so much to learn from him. I know it's been nearly 2100 years since he lived, but I think the story is as fresh as ever. With all that said, let's get into it. This is The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World. üìç So according to James Anthony Froude, the Romans had it coming. Before Caesar took over, Rome was in an inherently unstable position. Rome was a republic, and that comes from reis meaning thing, and publica, meaning public, reis publica. Literally, the public thing, the joint affair. So to have a republic, You need people to be involved in that joint affair. You need free men who can stand on their own two feet. And the Roman Republic was increasingly composed of slaves. The rich were buying up the smaller farms of the bankrupt. who had often gone bankrupt because they had been off fighting Rome's wars and, you know, leaving their farms kind of untended while they were gone and missing income during that time. And so the rich would then buy up these farms from these bankrupt soldiers when they came home and then they would fold them into their huge landownings and send the poor bankrupt farmers into the city of Rome itself to look for work and eke out a living on the verge of hunger and poverty as a mass of urban poor. And this created huge pressure for reform. But the only reform that came", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/the-caesar-guide-to-taking-over-the-world", "title": "The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World", "chunk_index": 1, "publication_date": "2024-03-31", "total_chunks_in_doc": 27}}
{"text": "landownings and send the poor bankrupt farmers into the city of Rome itself to look for work and eke out a living on the verge of hunger and poverty as a mass of urban poor . And this created huge pressure for reform . But the only reform that came The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World: was the worst kind. Many pushes were made for land reform, to break up these big estates, buy out the landowners with public money, and distribute portions of their land to the urban poor to go work, so that they can once again be productive citizens who are farming for themselves. But these measures were vehemently opposed by the optimates. So you had two parties in Rome, the optimates and the populares. And the optimates meant the best men, the aristocrats. The optimates were interested in holding up the old order in retaining the power of the Senate and opposing reform. These were the patricians and those who supported them. And then you had the populares and that was the reform party. They tried to come to power through support from the people. They supported land reform and often other reforms like extending the franchise, extending citizenship and voting rights to non Roman Italians. And the optimates opposed any reform at all costs. And the populares, when given power, often only implemented reforms that were antithetical to what was actually needed. Such as free grain distributions in Rome, which actually, if you think about it, tempted more nearly broke farmers off their farms and into the cities. Cause that's where you get, you know, free grain, free bread. As Froude writes, quote, The peasant proprietors were melting away, and Rome was becoming choked with impoverished citizens who ought to have been farmers and fathers of families, but were degenerating into a rabble fed upon the corn grants and occupied with nothing but spectacles and politics. And as the underlying problems worsened, the senatorial class, the optimates, showed no initiative in addressing these issues. Instead, the two factions opposed each other at any cost and spiraled out into ever widening circles of polarization. So here's another quote from, um, Cesar Esketch. It says, patriotism survived on the lips, but patriotism meant the ascendancy of the party. Which would maintain the existing order of things, or would overthrow it for a more equal distribution. So in other words, uh, patriotism to people, they weren't really thinking about Rome as a whole. They were just thinking about their faction And I think, if you were so inclined, you could find some interesting parallels with that situation, and, uh, let's say other times, maybe more current in history. So this led to a series of dictators, who seized power on behalf of one faction or the other, and they would bloodily purge their enemies, decimate the opposing party, and rule Rome in the", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/the-caesar-guide-to-taking-over-the-world", "title": "The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World", "chunk_index": 2, "publication_date": "2024-03-31", "total_chunks_in_doc": 27}}

So this led to a series of dictators , who seized power on behalf of one faction or the other , and they would bloodily purge their enemies , decimate the opposing party , and rule Rome in the The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World: name of their faction. On behalf of the optimates, this was accomplished by a very gifted general named Sulla. And on behalf of the Popularities, this was accomplished by two men, Sena and Marius. But really, Marius was the more powerful and more famous of the two. Marius was a war hero, and importantly for our story, was Julius Caesar's uncle. So you have a decreasing standard of living for most Romans. You have increasing polarization, you have escalating use of force as both parties use the levers of government to punish one another. And you have increasing concern with personal matters, a decrease in legitimate public spiritedness of public feeling, you know, for example, when one general, a guy who we will hear about later named Pompey returns from a glorious conquest that greatly enriches Rome, his first concern. Is for his personal safety when he's returning to Rome, not when he's at war, but when he's coming home, because this level of accomplishment, you know, while he was given lip service in the Senate, he was actually hated by the senators because it meant that the triumphant general had a leg up on everyone else, he would become more powerful and that was threatening to others. And so you can see how like, this is not. A great situation, right? When no one is really concerned in how Rome is doing. They're just concerned in how their faction is doing. And even within that, how they themselves are doing within that party. So into the situation is born. Gaas Julius Caesar Rome is at an all time peak in terms of power, but the very foundations of the republic are crumbling. Here's Freud's description of Julius Caesar in his childhood, or, uh, I guess as a young adult, He says, and now for the first time, we catch a personal view of young Julius CAEs. He was growing up in his father's house, a tall, slight, handsome youth, with dark piercing eyes, a sallow complexion, large nose, lips full, features refined and intellectual, sinewy and thick beyond what might have been expected from the generally slender figure. He was particular about his appearance, used the bath frequently, and attended carefully to his hair. His dress was arranged with studied negligence and he had a loose mode of fastening his girdle so peculiar as to catch the eye.

So , if you didn ' t catch that there at the end , Caesar had this particular way of dressing and he was The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World: something of a fashion icon. He was a very glamorous youth who was handsome, well liked, and dressed just a little bit differently, which drew attention, and Yeah, he actually was like notable for his fashion. for his fashion sense and as being a trendsetter amongst young Romans in how to dress and groom yourself. He was, of course, clean shaven, as basically every Roman young man would have been. Which, of course, right? You can't see a world conqueror like Caesar having facial hair. You gotta be clean shaven, right? Apex predators have to have a clean face. Napoleon, Caesar, George Washington, anyone who has landed on the moon, any U. S. president since, um, I don't know, since the 1800s? Who was the last bearded president? Harrison? Anyways, they're all clean shaven. You let yourself get a mustache, all of a sudden you're in Hitler and Stalin territory. Well, that's why today's sponsor is Henson Shaving. Yeah, I'm not sure about that transition, but Henson Shaving really is great. They are a family owned aerospace parts manufacturer that has made parts for the International Space Station and Mars Rover and they are bringing that precision engineering to the art of shaving. Their shaving system leads to less irritation, which is a huge issue for me personally. It's the reason I didn't shave for a long time. I have really sensitive skin, but they minimize blade extension to create less irritation. So if you think of a razor as like a diving board, it's basically the wobble of the board that leads to nicks and cuts. So they stabilize that blade using their precision manufacturing to give you a better shave. And it just makes sense from a cost standpoint as well. They have a safety razor and interchangeable blades. So it's only going to cost you three to 5 a year to shave. You know, you don't need eight blades or whatever they're on with some of these other mainstream shaving brands. A single blade actually works better, and hey, if a single sharp edge was good enough for Caesar, it's good enough for me. It's a better shave, less irritation, and way cheaper. So go to hensonshaving. com slash takeover, and use code takeover, and you'll get two years worth of blades, that's a hundred blades, for free with your razor.

Sorry for comparing you to Hitler or Stalin. If you don't shave. Okay, so, Caesar encouraged that sense of glamour, that mystique, in a couple of other ways during his adolescence besides the way that he dressed. There's one story in which he is captured by pirates and held for ransom. And they're asking for a certain amount, and he says, No, no, no. You need to ask for at least twice that. Which seems to not make sense, right? Um. He's captured by pirates, like these people could execute him if the ransom isn't being paid. Why are you encouraging them to ask for a bigger ransom? But it's because he's thinking about his reputation. So let's say that Bill Gates, his son, was abducted and held for 10, 000 ransom. Okay, 10k. Your first thought might be, wait, only 10, 000? Like, what's going on here? Do these people not know who he is? Have the Gates given away too much money? Is there nothing left? But if you heard that Bill Gates son was being held for a billion dollar ransom, that would make headlines. That would drive stories. I mean, obviously Bill Gates son being abducted would make headlines either way, but like, it would be an even bigger story if you heard that he's being held for a billion dollar ransom. That would make headlines. A reputation for his son, the billion dollar boy. Apologies to the Gates family for using them in that horrible analogy. You know, I wish nothing but health and safety on all of them, but that is what Caesar is getting at. If his ransom is big, it's going to create a sense of mystique and glamor and make headlines and make him seem important. And so anyway, the ransom does get paid, uh, he goes back and then he actually turns around. He had made friends with the pirates. He goes back, finds them, and they have to be executed. They're pirates. But he's become friends with these people. So his one kind of concession to these people being his friends is that he has them killed before they're crucified. Crucifixion is a horrible, torturous form of death. So. He says, look,", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/the-caesar-guide-to-taking-over-the-world", "title": "The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World", "chunk_index": 5, "publication_date": "2024-03-31", "total_chunks_in_doc": 27}}

He says , look , The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World: we'll just stab you, you're dead, and, and then we'll crucify you so that, um, you're my friends, at least I won't make you suffer. The other thing he does as an adolescent is he gets married pretty young, and the dictator Sulla comes to power, and Sulla is an optimist. And so he's looking at Julius Caesar, the nephew of his enemy, the former popular dictator, Marius, and he's saying, hmm, this kid might need to go. But I'll tell you what, kid, young Julius. I'm the dictator. I have complete control of Rome and I've murdered thousands of people, but I'll spare you. If you divorce your wife, who comes from a prominent family in the popularize party and marry a relative of mine, he makes a similar demand of Pompe, who was a young Roman general, who was even more of a hot shot than Caesar and had already made a reputation for himself. And Pompey agrees. He divorces his wife and marries someone who Sulla had chosen. I actually think it's Sulla's daughter, if I recall correctly. So here's what Froud writes about what Caesar does next. If Pompey had complied, who had made a position of his own, much more might it be expected that Caesar would comply. Yet Caesar answered with a distinct and unhesitating refusal. The terrible Sulla, in the fullness of his strength, after desolating half the homes in Italy, revolutionizing all Roman society, from the peasant's cottage, to the Apennines, to the Senate House itself, was defied by a mere boy. Throughout his career, Caesar displayed always a singular indifference to life. He had no sentimental passion about him, no Byronic mock heroics. He had not much belief either in God or the gods. On all such questions, he observed, from first to last, a profound silence. But one conviction he had. He intended, if he was to live at all, to live master of himself in matters which belong to himself. Sulla might kill him if he so pleased. It was better to die than to put away a wife who was the mother of his child and to marry some other woman at a dictator's bidding. Life on such terms was not worth keeping. And so here's Caesar defying a dictator, defying basically, you know, the King of Rome, , on a seemingly trivial matter, at least as far", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/the-caesar-guide-to-taking-over-the-world", "title": "The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World", "chunk_index": 6, "publication_date": "2024-03-31", "total_chunks_in_doc": 27}}
{"text": "other woman at a dictator ' s bidding . Life on such terms was not worth keeping . And so here ' s Caesar defying a dictator , defying basically , you know , the King of Rome , , on a seemingly trivial matter , at least as far The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World: as politics is concerned, because he doesn't want to live life by his terms. And this does a lot to also increase his reputation. So Caesar has to go hide out in the mountains. He's nearly caught and killed a number of times. Eventually, some relatives who are kind of in with the optimates are able to plea for clemency on Caesar's behalf. Sulla refuses at first, but after a lot of begging, he finally relents. And apparently Sulla can really see the talent in Caesar and says, Take him, since you will have it so. But I would have you know that the youth for whom you are so earnest will one day overthrow the aristocracy for whom you and I have fought so hardly. In this young Caesar, there are many Mariuses. So with this, Caesar can return to Rome and begin the life of a young and ambitious Roman statesman. For someone who is synonymous with grandeur and world changing impact, his ambition was very sensible. At this stage of his life, and frankly, for the rest of his life. Yes, he wanted to be the first man in Rome. He wanted to be consul, which was the highest position of leadership in Rome, essentially being president. But that was it. And while those, of course, are ambitious goals, they were what made sense for him. You know, he's not thinking, Alright, I want to extend the borders and make the greatest empire of all time. Which is eventually what he would do. Um, and essentially become monarch of Rome and become a God and be worshiped as a God after my death. Like he's not thinking any of those things. He's just thinking about the next step. I want to be the first man in Rome. I want to be console. I want to be the best I can be. And it reminds me of a quote from Paul Graham, very famous entrepreneur, very famous investor in Silicon Valley. And, uh, he writes about having kind of sensible goals. Uh, here's what he said. He said, Empirically, the way to do really big things seems to be to start with small things and grow them bigger. Want to dominate microcomputer software for decades? Start by writing a basic interpreter for a machine with a couple thousand users. Want to make the universal website a giant vacuum for people's time? by building a website where Harvard undergrads can stalk one another.

Neither Bill Gates nor Mark Zuckerberg knew how big their The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World: companies were going to get. All they knew is they were on to something. Maybe it's a bad idea to have really big ambitions initially, because the bigger your ambitions, the longer they're going to take to realize, And the longer you project into the future, the more likely you are to be wrong. So I like that idea. The way to do big things is to start with small things and just grow them bigger. Do the thing in front of you and do it really well and then take opportunities as they come to you. Froud essentially writes the same thing when talking about Caesar. He says, Men of genius who accomplish great things in this world do not trouble themselves with remote and visionary aims. They encounter emergencies as they rise and leave the future to shape itself as it may. Okay? So I love that, that connection. Both of these guys have the same idea. Men of genius, great men, people who accomplish a lot, they don't think about remote and visionary things that they have no way of doing or impacting, you know, decades from now. They just focus on the thing at hand. Okay, and I think that the story of Julius Caesar adheres nicely to that theory. He doesn't set out to create the Roman Empire, he simply meant to make it to the top of the Roman Republic and do the right thing and carry out much needed reforms. So he is sort of a sensible populist, he favors land reform and extending the franchise, but he isn't a rabble rouser. He doesn't stoke riots or whip up the mobs into a fury or anything like that. And as Caesar rises, one of the things he does very well is establish strategic alliances. The first of these is with someone named Pompey, uh, who we've talked about, who helps fund Caesar's rise. Pompey was a very mild populist, not a very ideological person, and Caesar gives him much needed backing, and then also with Crassus. And Crassus was the richest man in Rome. The way that Caesar is operating in this time reminds me a lot of a good quote about Rockefeller from the book Titan, um, where Roncher now writes, Rockefeller had a longer time frame. A more settled will than other people. And that's true of Caesar as well. He he's thinking in the longterm and he's got this very settled will. He knows exactly what he wants to accomplish. So for example, as Caesar", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/the-caesar-guide-to-taking-over-the-world", "title": "The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World", "chunk_index": 8, "publication_date": "2024-03-31", "total_chunks_in_doc": 27}}
{"text": "more settled will than other people . And that ' s true of Caesar as well . He he ' s thinking in the longterm and he ' s got this very settled will . He knows exactly what he wants to accomplish . So for example , as Caesar The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World: is becoming the head of the populist party, and he's really rising to prominence in that faction of Roman politics, there's a big flare up about something the optimates have done to offend the common people. And, um, basically they're going to have Caesar removed from his position extra judicially. And, um, here's how Froud describes what happens next. The mob refused to be comforted. They gathered, day after day. They clustered about the Pontifical Palace. They cried to Caesar to place himself at their head, that they might tear down the Senate House. Caesar, neither then nor ever, lent himself to popular excesses. He reminded the citizens that if others broke the law, they must themselves set an example of obeying it. And he bade them return to their homes. So he's got this opportunity to use the power of the people, to put himself at the head of a mob and flex his power. But he's got a longer time frame. He wants to be consul and he wants to reform Rome and set it on the right footing. And that requires him being a respected leader and not just a rabble rouser. And so he passes up the opportunity. He has this absolute iron will. There's another good description that I think conveys this. Uh, Caesar gets an appointment where, uh, as part of his job, he's supposed to throw, you know, festivals and, and games and, and do public things to kind of appease the people. And so Froud writes, he charmed the populace with a show of gladiators, unusually extensive. Personally, he cared nothing for these exhibitions, and he displayed his indifference ostentatiously by reading or writing while the butchery was going forward. Okay, that's kind of an amazing scene. Nothing can distract him. He has this total focus. And so, you know, even while these games that he threw, these gladiatorial games, are, are going on, he's up there in the stands, reading and writing letters. And by the way, uh, that is kind of true to his character. Caesar was, uh, A total email junkie, right? He's like Napoleon in that way. He's always writing letters. You know, other than Cicero, maybe he was the greatest letter writer of his age, great communicator and, and was always keeping in touch with people. Okay. So as part of his rise, he goes next to Spain where,", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/the-caesar-guide-to-taking-over-the-world", "title": "The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World", "chunk_index": 9, "publication_date": "2024-03-31", "total_chunks_in_doc": 27}}

So as part of his rise , he goes next to Spain where , The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World: um, he administers the Roman colony there. And he serves very admirably. He conducts a military campaign, completes the conquest of Spain, and it goes really well. He's a hero. And so he wants to celebrate. A triumph. A triumph is a very rare occasion in Roman politics and Roman history. They are celebrations of great military accomplishments. And they throw this huge party for you if you do something worthy of a triumph. It's like the Olympics, Mardi Gras, Christmas, and the Oscars all rolled into one. It is like the greatest thing that you could hope for as a Roman statesman. And so Caesar has done something worthy of a triumph. So this is like the pinnacle for anyone. You get to celebrate a triumph, but he wants to come home and capitalize on this popularity that he has to run for consul top job in Rome and the Senate forces him into a difficult position. The optimists can see that he's gaining power, that he's both popular and very capable, which he has proven with his stint in Spain, and they fear what he might do as consul. They fear that he might push through some of these reforms. And so they use some legal maneuvering to force a choice on him. If you want to celebrate a triumph, you cannot enter Rome until the triumph is celebrated. But in order to run for consul, you must be physically present in the city for the election. So he can't be both places at once. He can't be waiting outside the city for his triumph. And also be inside the city to run for consul. So Caesar has a choice. Do I run for consul or do I celebrate my triumph? And he doesn't hesitate. He enters the city forgoing his triumph in order to run for consul. It reminds me of the story of Arnold Schwarzenegger. He's just getting started in his movie career and he's the best bodybuilder in the world, but he's unknown as an actor and he gets an offer from. An old fitness guru named Jack LaLanne And Jack LaLanne makes an offer to Arnold to run his Chain of gyms and he offers him I think it's like five hundred thousand dollars Which is a lot of money now is a ton of money back then To run his gym chain.

And so Schwarzenegger says, he says no with no hesitation, because it wasn't part of his vision. It's a, it's a very flattering offer and it's a lot of money, but that's not his vision. And so he's not going to do it. And same thing with Caesar. Yeah, of course I want to celebrate a triumph, but. I know what I want in the long run, and it's not this. I want to run for consul, and I want to be the man. And so, he doesn't even think about it. Like, as soon as this choice is forced upon him, enters Rome, runs for consul. And he runs, and he wins. And the way that he wins, uh, one of the ways that he wins, is he forms a strategic alliance with Crassus and Pompey. We talked about earlier that he had, um, already become friends with them. Uh, but now they have the secret meeting and they form what is called the first triumvirate. It's called that now. Of course, at the time it was secret, they didn't call it anything. Um, but they formed this alliance. So you got Crassus, he's the money guy. He's the richest man in Rome and he represents the entrepreneurial class of Rome. And Pompey is the military guy. He's Rome's most impressive and renowned conqueror. And Caesar has the people. He's glamorous, famous, and popular with the common people. So with these three factions behind him, you know, Caesar's basically gonna be unstoppable. He's got the money, he's got the soldiers, and he's got the popularity. And the way that Caesar pulls these people together is kind of genius. He's a great dealmaker. And that is because he keeps things very simple and straightforward. There was one thing Crassus really wanted, one thing Pompey really wanted, and one thing that he really wanted. And he could make it happen if they all stuck together and made him consul.

Most of which were not important. Gil was complicated. And I'd be calling him on the phone, faxing him stuff over the holidays. And then when Steve comes in, he looks at the deal and says, here are the two things I want, and here's what you clearly want from us. And we had the deal done very quickly. And so Caesar does the same thing. He says, okay, Pompey, you want land reform because you have all these soldiers who you want to take care of, who served under you. And so we're going to pass land reform when I'm consul. Crassus, you want reform for the tax farmers. So these are people who, um, buy contracts. To go collect the taxes in the provinces of Rome. Well, it turns out they had paid way too much for these contracts and weren't able to recoup the costs. And so they wanted some relief. On the price that they had paid for these contracts and crassest, you know, he's, he's one of these guys, he's one of the money guys. So these are his people. So that's what he wants. And Caesar, he wants to extend citizenship. Uh, to more non Roman Italians, uh, other people in Italy. So they each have one thing that they really want. So Caesar just says, look, guys, let's all get in the room. Let's look at each other face to face. Let's stick together. You want this? You want this? I want this. We'll get it all done if you make me consul. And so with their backing, with their money and endorsement, Um, he becomes consul. The first thing he does is publish essentially a daily newspaper of the dealings of the Senate. And this is really helpful to kind of drain the swamp, so to speak. And the senators can no longer get away with some of their shenanigans, uh, cause it's going to be published in the people. Are going to find out what's really going on in the Roman Senate. And then he immediately gets around to passing his reforms. He first proposes them in the Senate and they are completely unwilling to play ball.

He first proposes them in the Senate and they are completely unwilling to play ball . So he basically runs over them The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World: and goes straight to, uh, the other body, you know, representative body in Roman government, which was the assembly. So you have the Senate, which represents the aristocrats, you know, the very wealthy kind of old money Rome. And then you have the assembly, which is the rest of the citizens. And so it's complicated, but really you were supposed to kind of go through the Senate, um, for big initiatives like this, at least traditionally, but there was a path that was strictly legal, you know, technically speaking, where you could just kind of take it straight to the assembly. And so Caesar, you know, he, he tries his best at first. To go through the Senate to go, you know, the normal route and when they won't even touch it or discuss it, and they're completely obstinate, he says, okay, you know, well, here's what he says. He says, I invited you to revise the law. I was willing that if any clause displeased you, it should be expunged. You will not touch it. Well, then the people must decide. So he's got the people, the military and the money on his side. And, um, you know, if the Senate won't play ball at all, he's very willing to play fast and loose with the rules and run over the Senate when necessary. While always maintaining a pretext that what he is doing is, strictly speaking, legal. So, his year as consul amounts to a small revolution. He gets all three of those major initiatives passed that he wanted to. And it's a big change for Roman government. Here's what Froude writes about it. He says, The Senate was now itself suspended. The consul acted directly with the Assembly. Without obstruction and without remonstrance. Still more remarkably, and as the distinguishing feature of his term in office, Caesar carried with the help of the people, the body of admirable laws, which are known to the jurists as the legis juliae and mark an epic in Roman history. They were laws as unwelcome to the aristocracy as they were essential to the continued existence of the Roman state. Laws which had been talked of in the Senate, but which could never pass through the preliminary stage of resolutions, and were now enacted over the Senate's head by the will of Caesar and the sovereign power of the nation. So after a year, you have all these remarkable reforms.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/the-caesar-guide-to-taking-over-the-world", "title": "The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World", "chunk_index": 13, "publication_date": "2024-03-31", "total_chunks_in_doc": 27}}
{"text": "the Senate , but which could never pass through the preliminary stage of resolutions , and were now enacted over the Senate ' s head by the will of Caesar and the sovereign power of the nation . So after a year , you have all these remarkable reforms . The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World: Uh, his term is up, Rome is on sound footing. The optimates are basically sidelined and it seems like the populares, you know, kind of Caesar's men are in charge for the indefinite future and these reforms are working to make Rome work again. So after his one year consulship, he can't run again. So Caesar goes. Um, has himself assigned to Gaul, which is modern France. Well, actually, he's assigned to, first, to Cisalpine Gaul, which is northern Italy. , and then he ends up getting also assigned, , Transalpine Gaul, which is modern day France, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, uh, plus the Rhineland, if you want to get technical about it, a little bit of Germany. Gaul is an excellent opportunity. The Gauls were Rome's ancient and most feared enemy, at least since the Carthaginians had been defeated in the Punic Wars. The Gauls had sacked Rome in the 300s BC and this was a humiliation that the Romans had never forgotten and would and could never forget. As it would happen, at this very moment, there was chaos in Gaul. The German tribes, so, so the Germans and the Gauls are related and pretty similar. Uh, and what divides them is the Rhine, the Rhine River. And so the Germans over in Germany, on the other side of the Rhine, We're just getting this energy. They were newly expansionist and we're making excursions into Gaul. And so they're displacing local populations and tribes who would inevitably pick up stakes and leave, go somewhere else. But I mean, Gaul was, you know, had people everywhere. So wherever they tried to land and settle, they created conflict with other tribes. And this is setting off a chain of events that you can see where it's leading, right? It's putting pressure outward. And so it's only a matter of time before some tribes, you know, Start moving down towards Italy and who knows, you know, maybe they'll attack Rome again and try and sack us again. So Caesar intervenes in this conflict and in the process over the next 10 years, he annexes Gaul and makes it a Roman province. He is brilliant. as a commander. He's great with his men. He's like one of the boys. He calls them comrades, which was not traditional. You know, usually you have this aristocratic general and commoners as soldiers.

You know , usually you have this aristocratic general and commoners as soldiers . And so , uh , they The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World: talk down to them, but not him. He, he refers to them instead of as, you know, citizens or men, he calls them comrades. He shares their rations and their conditions, often sleeping under the stars with them, which was very unusual behavior for an aristocratic Roman general. He of course had the hallmark of every great general. Throughout history. Speed. Froud writes, swiftness of movement was Caesar's distinguishing excellence. Okay, I love that. Swiftness of movement was Caesar's distinguishing excellence. So he's often showing up where he's not expected. He's also very proactive and audacious when conditions seem uncertain or fragile. His default reaction is to go on the offensive, if possible. It reminds me of Napoleon. Um, he has this quote, audacity, audacity, audacity, always audacity. In other words, always do the audacious thing, always attack, always, always go on the offensive. And that's very much Caesar as well. He has the necessary attribute of equanimity. He stays cool under pressure. Froud writes, The even temperament of his mind was never discomposed, and at each moment he was able, always, to decide and to do what the moment required. And I think that is such an important attribute of great leaders, and it's so difficult to actually do. It's so easy to say, right? Like, alright, I'm gonna be calm under pressure. And then, you know, you get the famous Mike Tyson quote, Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth. Like you, you say that and then you get punched in the mouth and all of a sudden you're on tilt and, um, and your mind just goes blank, but it's a really necessary attribute. If you want to be a great leader, you have to find that, that space. Of mind that, that calm, that clarity when things start to go sideways. And Caesar, I mean, he's just amazing at that. Froud writes, Caesar was never more calm than under a reverse. So like, you know, he only lost, , two battles, I think in his career, but he had many reverses, right? You know, one of his lieutenants would, would lose a battle. , and he had definitely situations and scenarios in Gaul, which were very harrowing.

He , you know , he came close to defeat a number of times . And . Every time , The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World: his mind was crystal clear, and he was able to very quickly decide on the proper course of action and carry it out. So, it's one of the things that made Caesar great, that level headedness. He seems, just in everything that you read about him, this hyper rational, calm, just very level headed. Very level headed person. As Gaul, eventually, You know, all these tribes realize, Oh, he's taking over. And if we don't act now, you know, the Romans are going to take over. We're going to become a Roman province. And so toward the end of Caesar's 10 years, they undertake one final revolt against the Romans with virtually all the tribes uniting against Caesar. And he defeats them at the battle of Alessia. And it's this really great battle. I won't get really deep into it, but essentially. , the main force of, of the Gallic tribes is in the city of Alessia, and so the Romans besiege them. And so, uh, the, the leader of, of the Gallic tribes, this guy Vercingetorix, uh, he sends out a message. He says, hey everyone, this is it. Like, this is the moment. If we don't defeat the Romans here, we're done. It's all over. Anyone you got, send them. So all of these soldiers from all over Gaul come to attack the Romans. So the Romans are surrounded and so they're besieging the city and they turn around and they build a wall on the outside of their siege. So they've got kind of like a siege wall on the inside to block up Alessia and now they've got a siege wall on the outside to defend against this relieving force that's coming against them. And so, you know, the Romans are winning and then there's this moment where all these Gallic tribes realize, all right, we have one more chance. We got to attack. And so they attack. With as many forces as they can from the outside, Vercingetorix from the inside sees, okay, this is my moment. So he attacks from the inside. They're pinching the Romans defenses at this one place. And so Caesar says, all right, this is it. And so he rides to the heat of the battle, to this most pivotal place leading his elite troops.

And he ' s going with his robe on and with his helmet off The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World: so that everyone can see that it's Caesar. You know, and this really rallies his men. They're like, Oh, Caesar himself is with us. You know, he's coming in person to help fight with us. And, uh, apparently it's kind of raised up on a hill. So you've got this whole siege around a city and everyone can see this battle going on. And to me, it's like this enormous sporting event. With the highest stakes ever. And I just imagine all his men like able to see that, Oh man, this is where the battle is going to be decided. Look, the goals are attacking from both sides. And then they see like, Oh, it's like, it's like a professional wrestling moment, like, Oh, Caesar's here! Caesar himself! He's going to the heat of the battle! And, uh, I think it's a great moment. They, of course, they beat back the attack, um, Vercingetorix has to surrender, and Gaul is subdued, and is made a Roman province. Now, during all these years that Caesar is fighting in Gaul, At first, he has been able to pull strings to basically manage affairs back in Rome. So he's kind of like the puppet master, controlling things back in Rome. He was still the head of the populist party, and they were still firmly in control, with him at the head and Crassus and Pompey providing crucial support. Well, that all kind of breaks down, kind of midway through his stint in Gaul. Crassus ends up dead in a military campaign and the alliance with Pompey falls apart when Pompey's wife, who was Caesar's daughter, dies. So, Caesar only had one legitimate daughter, probably only had one daughter ever, and so that daughter was married to Pompey. And so that would be Caesar's heir and Pompey's heir, right? So they really have, like, their fortunes knit together. And apparently Pompey was very in love with this wife, with Caesar's daughter. And so that really tied them together. And so when she dies, , they no longer have this personal connection. The Optimates had also been very hard at work trying to recruit Pompey to their side. Remember, he had always been moderate, not very ideological.

That was actually his epithet. That was his name. Pompey the great. You're Pompey the great. As long as you are allied to Caesar, you're always going to be, you know, the junior partner, especially now that he has brought himself all this fame and money and gall. And so this works on him eventually, when his wife dies. And so he basically starts siding with the optimates and he turns on Caesar. Um, And so, um, you know, the optimists can see, okay, we got Pompey on our side. We're back in control, but Caesar, his term is about to be up in Gaul and he's going to come home. It's been 10 years, so he can run for consul again, and he's got all this popularity and they're very afraid of Caesar because of this. And so they do everything to make sure that this cannot happen. They basically declare war on the plebs, the common citizens of Rome. They dismiss the people's tribunes, and, and, uh, I don't want to get into all the mechanisms of Roman law, but, uh, these are Caesar's legal protectors. If Caesar returns home unarmed, and the tribunes of the plebs are no longer in operation, he will be completely at the mercy of the optimates in the Senate, who hate him. And they're for sure going to prosecute him and throw him in jail, or exile him. Or they might even have him murdered. If you read Cicero's letters from this time, they are full of allusions to having Caesar taken out as a convenient way to resolve political crisis. And I'll tell you what. You might not worry about your political opponents murdering you, but you should still be concerned about bad actors.

He's worried about being murdered or being prosecuted. But it's not just that. If he goes back and lets his enemies have their way, Caesar is basically complicit in submitting to optimate rule. They had basically nullified the Constitution, and to the extent that Caesar stood for popular rule, if he submitted, then his reforms, and popular rule of Rome, was dead. And so, Caesar gathers his troops, Pompey gathers some of his troops, uh, but Pompey really delays. And it's interesting, when most people meet uncertainty, their first reaction is to vacillate. To do nothing. To worry. To fret. To say, okay, what's gonna happen here? And that is what Pompey is doing. So Caesar repeatedly requests a face to face meeting with him. He feels that if they can just talk things through, they'll be able to figure out a diplomatic solution to this whole crisis. But Pompey never comes. And so, you know, Caesar is busy working to come to a diplomatic resolution, and Pompey is", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/the-caesar-guide-to-taking-over-the-world", "title": "The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World", "chunk_index": 19, "publication_date": "2024-03-31", "total_chunks_in_doc": 27}}

And so , you know , Caesar is busy working to come to a diplomatic resolution , and Pompey is The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World: not. And at the same time, Caesar is readying his forces, gathering legions, building strength. And Pompey really isn't doing anything. He's not doing much to prepare his army. And so the great statesman Cicero wrote to a friend from Rome. He says, you ask what Pompey means to do. I do not think he knows himself. Certainly none of us know it is all panic and blunder. We are uncertain whether he will make a stand or leave Italy. And so, you know, again, when people are faced with uncertainty, their default reaction is to wait and see, to prepare for neither scenario. But Caesar does the opposite. He prepares for both. He pursues a diplomatic solution at the same time that he's preparing his forces in case there is a military conflict. And, you know, he's just the opposite of Pompey. No one could say that they did not know where Caesar stood, or what he wanted, or what he planned to do. So in the end, a diplomatic resolution can't be found, and Caesar marches into Italy. And so Caesar invades Italy with that settled will, that focus, that intense purpose that defined him. And as always, uh, this is something that we see with Genghis Khan, with Arnold Schwarzenegger, and now Caesar. People really respond to clear purpose and a clear vision. And so a lot of cities just start opening up their gates to Caesar, start joining him. They're like, alright, here's a man with a plan, we know what he's trying to do. And so that builds momentum, and a lot of people join him. Now, Caesar basically fights the Civil War. with one arm tied behind his back. He is unbelievably forgiving. One of his great hallmarks is his clemency. He is always forgiving his enemies and allowing them to join him, or even to leave and go rejoin the enemy, the forces fighting him. And on the one hand, this is a strategic move. Cicero wrote, Caesar's treacherous clemency enchants the men. Okay, so I love that. His treacherous clemency, as if it is somehow underhanded. To forgive your enemies. It's an act of treachery to not slaughter Roman citizens. But yeah, he is right. It really did enchant people. If you are a populist, you know that you are likely dead. If Pompey wins, there's going to be bloody reprisals and mass killings.

If Pompey wins , there ' s going to be bloody reprisals and mass killings . And that stiffens The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World: your resolve, right? Like I'm going to do anything to make sure Pompey doesn't win. Cause if he does, it's over for me. But if you're an optimist and Caesar is going around forgiving everyone, Well, you know, maybe I'm not going to fight so hard for the Optimates. It wouldn't be so bad if Caesar takes over. I could be convinced. You're saying if I give up now, I can just come back to Rome and be forgiven and not participate in the civil war at all. Like I don't have to pick a side. Okay. Like that's, that sounds like a pretty interesting deal. And so his clemency really is, as Cicero says, enchanting many leading citizens. But in other ways, you know, this strategy really is fighting with one arm tied behind his back. He has opportunities to seize their resources, kill their men, wipe out the optimates, and he doesn't take it. And one of my big takeaways from this book and from the life of Caesar is that this is the true genius of Caesar. Every two bit dictator who had come before him was seduced by the partisanship. And how could you not be? I mean, look at our own current time. And now imagine that there were thousands of political murders to go along with. It was just incredibly tempting to just murder the other guys, take their stuff and take power. Put your party in charge. Like, there were more than enough events in history that you could point to and say, Well, look when Sulla did this. Well, look when Marius did this. Like, remember when you killed all these? You killed my cousin. Like, there's so much stuff that you could look at and point to and justify yourself in just absolutely taking revenge on the opposing party. But Caesar resists that. He wants to take ownership of the whole of Rome. He doesn't want to represent the ascendancy of populist politics. He wants to represent a new Rome. Once again, united, this time behind him, and a new, more rational way of doing things. So once again, he has a more settled will and a longer time horizon. And that means he has to do things the hard way. Well, the play by play of the Civil War is, he races through Italy, Pompey and his forces have to flee to Greece. Caesar audaciously chases Pompey to Greece, where he attacks", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/the-caesar-guide-to-taking-over-the-world", "title": "The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World", "chunk_index": 21, "publication_date": "2024-03-31", "total_chunks_in_doc": 27}}

Caesar audaciously chases Pompey to Greece , where he attacks The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World: with an inferior force. Caesar is nearly defeated, but he retreats, regroups, , and then turns things around, and ends up defeating Pompey at the Battle of Pharsalus. Pompe goes on the run, but Caesar chases him down to Egypt, where Pompe is captured and executed by the local Egyptians. They expected, uh, this move to ingratiate themselves with Caesar. , you know, here is the new leader of Rome. He, he's won the Civil War. He beat poi. So yeah, let's capture and kill his opponent. He's gonna love that, right? No, they couldn't be more wrong. Caesar wanted Pompe as a living prize that he could bring back with him to Rome to show that Rome was once again united in this time behind Caesar's rule. Like this is ultimate prize, right? Like, look, here's the guy you were all united behind Pompey. And now he's with me, which he would have to be since Caesar had him captured. And so this would really unify Rome. So he's really upset that they killed Pompey. Now, as Caesar makes his way back to Rome, he settles all of Rome's affairs along the way, fighting wars in Egypt and Asia to solidify their provinces there. Again, he's not thinking of himself as a partisan whose primary goal is to defeat the other party. He's thinking of himself as a Roman, whose primary responsibility is to settle Rome's affairs. So rather than rush back and solidify his control in Italy, he's making sure that all of Rome's provinces are taken care of along the way. This delays him significantly in coming home. And the fact that he delays coming home, plus the fact that he had refused to purge the optimates meant that they have time to gather together and reform. This time they did it in the Roman province of Africa, modern Tunisia. So, when Caesar gets back to Italy, he has to raise another army, take it to Africa, and defeat the Optimates there. And then, once he does that, they regather in Spain, and he has to chase them down and defeat them there as well. Again, none of this would have been necessary if he had just purged the Optimates from the beginning. But if he had done that, he wouldn't have been Caesar. He wouldn't have been able to unite everyone behind his rule. And he wouldn't have been able", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/the-caesar-guide-to-taking-over-the-world", "title": "The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World", "chunk_index": 22, "publication_date": "2024-03-31", "total_chunks_in_doc": 27}}

He wouldn ' t have been able to unite everyone behind his rule . And he wouldn ' t have been able The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World: to put Rome on really sound footing. And we wouldn't know his name 2000 years later. One curious thing Caesar does that hits home this approach is what he does with the letters of every defeated army. Here is how Frow describes what happens after the battle of Pharsalus, when he defeats Pompey. Quote, was found his secret correspondence, implicating persons perhaps whom Caesar had never suspected, revealing the mysteries of the past three years. Curiosity and even prudence might have tempted him to look into it, but his only wish was that the past should be forgotten. He burnt the whole mass of papers unread. So in other words, he's saying, look, we're not doing this factionalism thing I don't care who was plotting against me. It's over. I won, and we're all Romans now. So, you know, like, that just shows how far he was willing to go, to kind of let the past be past and look towards the future and a new Rome. And it really like no one else could have done this. And it's ironic that his name has come to be synonymous with the end of representative government and its replacement with monarchy and tyranny, because he had every opportunity to be more tyrannical, to make things easier on himself and gain more power. And he consistently passed it up for the sake of a united Rome. I'm not trying to make him out to be some sort of benevolent saint. He was an ambitious man. But his ambition was not personal, or a little bit, I mean, of course, a little bit it was. But mainly, it was that he had a vision for Rome. He wanted Rome to be something new, to be something better, to be what it could be. And that was what led him. Well, once he defeats his enemies in Spain, you know, kind of, for the third time, he sets about reforming the Roman Empire in a much more permanent and lasting way. Luckily, he moves quickly and has these reforms passed in very short order, because it is only a year from his final victory in Spain in March of 45 BC until his assassination on the Ides of March in 44 BC.

And they did it despite the fact that any thinking person could see that a return to the patrician led constitution was now The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World: impossible. But they couldn't destroy his legacy. And what was that legacy? I think Froude has a very nice summary where he talks about Caesar and his relationship to Christianity. Relates him a little bit to Jesus. And here's what he says Of Caesar, it may be said that he came into the world at a special time and for a special object. The old religions were dead from the pillars of Hercules to the Euphrates and the Nile and the principles on which human society had been constructed were dead. Also, the remained of spiritual conviction, only the common and human sense of justice and morality. And out of this sense, some ordered system of government had to be constructed, under which quiet men could live and labor and eat the fruit of their industry. Under a rule of this material kind, there can be no enthusiasm, no chivalry, no saintly aspirations, no patriotism of the heroic type. It was not to last forever. A new life was about to dawn for mankind. Poetry and faith and devotion were to spring again out of the seeds which were sleeping in the heart of humanity. But the life which is to endure grows slowly, and as the soil must be prepared before the wheat can be sown, so before the kingdom of heaven could throw up its chutes, there was needed a kingdom of this world, where the nations were neither torn in pieces by violence, nor rushing after false ideals and spurious ambitions. Such a kingdom was the empire of the Caesars. A kingdom where peaceful men could work, think and speak as they pleased and travel freely among the provinces ruled for the most part by men who protected life and property and forbade fanatics to tear each other in pieces for their religious opinions. It is not lawful for us to put any man to death. Was the complaint of the Jewish priests to the Roman governor? Had Europe and Asia been covered with independent nations? Each with a local religion represented in its ruling powers, Christianity must have been stifled in its cradle. If St. Paul had escaped the Sanhedrin at Jerusalem, he would've been torn to pieces by the silversmiths. At Ephesus, the appeal to Caesar's judgment seat was the shield of his mission and alone made possible. His success and this spirit, which confined government to its simplest duties while it left opinion unfettered, was especially present in Julius Caesar himself from Can't of All Kinds. He was totally free. He was a friend of the people, but he indulged in no enthusiasm for liberty.

{"text": "government to its simplest duties while it left opinion unfettered , was especially present in Julius Caesar himself from Can ' t of All Kinds . He was totally free . He was a friend of the people , but he indulged in no enthusiasm for liberty . He fought The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World: his battles to establish some tolerable degree of justice in the government of this world, and he succeeded, though he was murdered for doing it. and startling resemblance between the fate of the founder of the kingdom of this world and the founder of the kingdom not of this world, for which the first was a preparation. Each was denounced for making himself a king. Each was maligned as the friend of publicans and sinners. Each was betrayed by those whom he had loved and cared for. Each was put to death. And Caesar also was believed to have risen again, and ascended into heaven, and become a divine being. Okay, so that is what Fraud thinks the legacy of Caesar was. A more rational form of government, where men could go and converse, and believe and worship as they pleased. And, Um, as a consequence, this led to the flourishing of Christianity and a new way of life for, especially for Europe, um, although for much of the rest of the world as well. Okay. So what is the Caesar guide to taking over the world? The first is to set aside remote or fantastical plans. Solve the problem that is in front of you and do it well. As Paul Graham says, Empirically, the way to do really big things seems to be to start with small things and grow them bigger. The next takeaway is to have a clearer vision than others and a longer time horizon. The third takeaway for me is that when you confront petty tribalism, or polarization, or factionalism, whether that is political in a strict sense, or perhaps political in a more corporate politics way of speaking, , you overcome politics by defeating it, but not by engaging in it. Caesar belonged to a party, yes, the populist party, and he used that party to take power and to serve as his power base. But he never pretended to be a partisan. His goal was always a rational, united, efficient, and just Rome. Refusing to engage in partisanship is doing things the hard way, but what you can accomplish is so much more impressive. Okay, my next takeaway. Speed and initiative. You always set the agenda. You always dictate the matter whenever possible. Remember, swiftness of movement was Caesar's distinguishing excellence. And so, if you want to be great like him, that must also be your distinguishing excellence. Swiftness of movement. Another takeaway is the power of glamour. Of having a strong brand. Of having some mystique about you.

Of having some mystique about you . And Caesar did that in a number The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World: of ways. He did it in the way that he dressed. He did it in the way that he wrote. And, um, these missives that he would issue from the Civil War as well as from Gaul. Um, but in everything that he did, he cultivated this glamour and this mystique. Another big takeaway, I think, is, this is a great quote from Froud, he says, , in his writings, as in his life, Caesar is always the same. Direct, straightforward, unmoved, saved by occasional tenderness, describing with unconscious simplicity, how the work which had been forced upon him was accomplished. So I like that. Simplicity and constancy. He kept a level head when things were going right. He kept a level head when things were going wrong. He couldn't be moved from his one goal and from the simple steps that were going to get him there. And then lastly, in the midst of uncertainty, don't freeze. Prepare for every scenario. You know, Pompey prepared for neither, waiting to see what would happen. And Caesar, while he was waiting to see what would happen, prepared for both. So there you go. I hope you enjoyed this episode. Again, If you want more details, some of the blow by blow campaign stuff, you can go listen to my Caesar series in this feed. But I hope that you were as inspired as I was. Caesar came along at an opportune time. Yes, he was in the right place at the right time to see through some of these reforms. But, I am increasingly convinced that there was no one else waiting in the wings. If Caesar had not come along, Rome just would have collapsed under the weight of its own contradictions. And it would not have become the crown jewel of empire. Rome would not serve as an inspiration and model up to the current day without Julius Caesar. Like, the Roman Empire really is a creation of his unique genius. And so he deserves his place in the pantheon of the greatest men ever to have lived. Ave Caesar. May our world be blessed with another man of his genius in the near future. üìç Okay, until next time, thank you for listening to How to Take Over the World ‚Äç", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/the-caesar-guide-to-taking-over-the-world", "title": "The Caesar Guide to Taking Over the World", "chunk_index": 26, "publication_date": "2024-03-31", "total_chunks_in_doc": 27}}

He found her among the, ol-ko-NUDE, a tribe known for the beauty of their women. The young woman he found was a beautiful girl named Holun. They did not know each other long, but in that short time they fell deeply in love, in the way that only teenagers can, likely neither of them were older than 16.After the wedding, Chiledu put Holun in an ox cart, and commenced the journey home to the lands of his own people.As they neared the end of their journey, they drove their cart near a mountain.A mountain, as fate would have it, where three brothers were hunting. The men spotted the cart, and saw an opportunity.They were from the Borijin clan, one of the poorest clans on the Mongol steppe. But the cart looked nice, it probably carried goods of value, and even more importantly, even from a distance they could see that the girl looked pretty.The brothers drove their horses off the mountain and down toward the young couple. Chiledu‚Äôs heart raced as he saw the dust from the horses hooves get closer and heard the men‚Äôs cries.Chiledu prepared to face them, but his wife Holun objected.‚ÄòDid you see the look on the faces of those men?

As Chiledu disappeared over the horizon and the men neared to take her, Holun let out a scream so violent that according to legend it stirred up the river and shook the woods and valley. The two lovers would never see each other again.The middle of the three brothers was named Yesugei, and he claimed her for his own. His rightful property by the law of the jungle.

Holun had started on this journey with a husband whom she Ghengis Khan (Part 1): loved. She had expected to live a good life with him and his tribe who had ample herds and a good reputation.Now she found herself in the impoverished camp of a roguish hunter and warrior, a man who she did not know.It was not long before she was pregnant.This new husband, Yesugei, was away at war when the child was born.Other women must have been present to help at certain times during the labor, but given her recent arrival and her status as an outsider, I imagine she must have done much of it alone.When the child struggled into the world, she first noticed that he was a boy. A large, healthy boy with reddish hair and gray eyes. Then she noticed his right hand clenched in a fist. She peeled back his fingers to reveal a large blood clot, the size of a knuckle bone.Her husband returned some days later. While he had been away - fighting a neighboring tribe - he had killed a man named Temujin. So he named the boy Temujin, after his fallen foe.As Holun held the boy, she must have contemplated his future. She didn‚Äôt know exactly how his life would go, but she knew he would likely suffer poverty, hunger, and violence.And she must have been disturbed by the blood clot he had brought with him into the world. Mongls were prone to see signs in nature. And this was a powerful one. But what did it mean? Was it a prophecy? A curse? Did it portend good or bad fortune? What did it say about the child in her arms?Holun contemplated these things in her heart as she held her baby boy and stared out at the vast rolling hills and the endless sky. In this rundown camp, she could not have imagined that the life that fate held for this baby boy that the world would come to know as genghis khan.

If Genghis Khan wrote a book about , you know , Genghis Khan life coach , ten steps to Ghengis Khan (Part 1): a better you, you‚Äôd think it would be a pretty weird book, right? Would he include a chapter on the best way to lop off a head? Or maybe in the relationship section he would have a couple pages about how to treat a new wife who you have just kidnapped. And the advice might vary depending on whether you had killed her husband or not.But I think he‚Äôs worth studying for a couple reasons. The first is that I was shocked at how many similarities there are between the leadership style, the strategies and tactics of Genghis Khan and other great leaders, even more modern ones like a Disney or Steve Jobs.The other thing I would say is that the story of Genghis Khan can stretch your imagination of what is possible. Which isn‚Äôt to say that you are going to be anything like Genghis Khan, the way of the steppe warrior is closed. It‚Äôs not an option anymore. But if he go from being nobody, an outsider born in one of the poorest areas on the Mongol steppe, to building the largest contiguous land empire in human history, at its zenith the empire was larger than the entire continent of Africa, then maybe you can accomplish a little more than you had thought. Maybe someone listening can have a global impact even if it looks very different than Genghis Khan‚Äôs. I hope.I find that very ambitious people make me raise the level of my ambition, even if they are ambitious in radically different ways which Genghis Khan obviously was.The other reason to study his life is it‚Äôs just a great story.In terms of sources, I read Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World by Jack Weatherford, which is the best biography. If you're looking for a Genghis Khan biography, I really recommend it. I also reference a copy of the Secret History of the Mongols. And I read Empires of the Steppes by Kenneth Harl. If you want to buy any of those three books, use the link in the show notes and you‚Äôll be supporting the show.Last thing I‚Äôll mention is the pronunciation of his name. First of all, throughout his early life he was known as Temujin. That was his name. Genghis Khan was a title that was given later. It was probably originally pronounced Chingis Khan.

Ghengis Khan (Part 1): I usually just stick with standard American pronunciation, it makes it simpler and I think easier to listen to and understand.Okay, with all of that out of the way, let‚Äôs get into it, let‚Äôs hear about the life of Genghis Khan, after this quick break.Insert Indeed ad. Early ChildhoodThe Point: He was poor and born into difficult circumstancesTemujin was born in 1162 AD in what is current day Mongolia to a poor family.The great steppe is one of the world‚Äôs most significant land features, stretching from western Ukraine, eastern europe and central Asia, and into China, almost to the Pacific Ocean. The steppe is basically one big connected rolling grassland.And on the steppe, herding is how one acquires wealth.Mongols kept horses, sheep, goats, cows, and camels.These animals provided milk and meat for eating, hides for use in clothing, furniture, and tents, and bones for use as tools, weapons, and decorations.Of course, having everything you own tied up in easily moveable livestock meant that raiding and violence was incredibly common. Fighting and killing was not an optional part of life for young Mongol men.The Mongol steppe was a violent and unpredictable place. You can think of it like the movie Mad Max but with horses instead of cars, and grass instead of gas.Mongols didn‚Äôt like to fight up close, they preferred to use the bow and arrow, and were expert bowmen.Temujin‚Äôs father had to fight more than most, and that was because he didn‚Äôt have vast herds.He belonged to the Borijin clan. These were some of the poorest people on the steppe, because they didn‚Äôt possess vast grasslands on which they could feed large herds. They were hunters who lived in the forested areas around Mount Burkhan Khaldun, a sacred mountain that was the spiritual heart of Mongolia.Hunting provided a meager existence, and any time game was scarce, Temujin‚Äôs father, Yesugei, and others like him, would need to raid the herds of wealthier clans in order to feed themselves.The other thing that made the area poor is that it was so far from settled civilization. On the periphery of the steppe, herders traded with cities in modern day Russia, India, and China for silks, metals, and other refined goods.Far from these cities, it was rare for such goods to make their way to the Borijin clan.Growing up in traditional Mongol fashion, Temujin would have learned to ride a horse before he learned to walk, and would have", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/ghengis-khan-part-1", "title": "Ghengis Khan (Part 1)", "chunk_index": 3, "publication_date": "2023-09-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 24}}
{"text": ", and other refined goods . Far from these cities , it was rare for such goods to make their way to the Borijin clan . Growing up in traditional Mongol fashion , Temujin would have learned to ride a horse before he learned to walk , and would have Ghengis Khan (Part 1): learned to use a bow as soon as he was strong enough to draw it.He participated in some herding of what flocks they had, and very early on he would have learned to hunt.Sometimes individuals hunted by tracking down prey, you know, how most people think of hunting nowadays. But there was another common way for the Mongols to hunt.A group of men would mount up and ride in circles around an area with known game in it. As they tightened the circle closer and closer, they would slowly drive them to a central slaughtering point.I mention that because Temujin would take many of his later tactics and strategies from these group hunting techniquesTemujin was a sensitive young man. He cried easily, was scared of dogs, and his brother was the better archer and wrestler.So to summarize his childhood: Temujin was in a difficult situation in a poor family at the end of the world. And things were about to get worse. Things Fall ApartThe Point: Things go from bad to worse for Temujin When he‚Äôs still only eight years old, Temujin‚Äôs father takes him to find a wife. Eight is obviously young to get married, and this might have been because Yesugei could see that there was tension brewing between Temujin and his older half-brother who was born only a few months before Temujin, to his first wife. When Mongol men were engaged, they typically worked for the bride's family for a few months or years to work off a bride price. So it would be a few years before Temujin and his wife were actually married.And the idea was to go back to Temujin‚Äôs mother‚Äôs tribe and find a wife there.But along the way, they stay with a family whose daughter, Borte, is about the same age as Temujin. And the two apparently hit it off, Borte and Temujin fall very deeply in love with each other, and her family is charmed by Temujin, so it‚Äôs decided that they will be married.That‚Äôs one of the things you see throughout Temujin‚Äôs life. He had this sort of golden boy phenomenon. He was incredibly charismatic. So people just give him stuff for no reason and do what he wants. People are just constantly charmed by him.So Yesugei leaves Temujin with his new in-laws and heads home.And one thing I should point out, they are always staying with people, and that was how it worked on the steppe, there were virtually no permanent buildings, no inns or taverns, and so you expected to stay with", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/ghengis-khan-part-1", "title": "Ghengis Khan (Part 1)", "chunk_index": 4, "publication_date": "2023-09-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 24}}

And one thing I should point out , they are always staying with people , and that was how it worked on the steppe , there were virtually no permanent buildings , no inns or taverns , and so you expected to stay with Ghengis Khan (Part 1): others on your journeys. And hospitality customs were very important to these peoples, you were expected to treat guests well.Yesugei comes upon a party, a feast. And he realizes that it‚Äôs the tribe of the original Temujin. The guy he had killed and named his son after.But he decides to try to join the feast anyway. He just figures he can keep a low profile, disguise himself, and hopefully not be recognized as the guy who killed Temujin.Well they do recognize him, and they poison him, and by the time he makes it back home, he is on death‚Äôs doorstep.Holun sends for Temujin but by the time he makes it back home, Yesugei is already dead.This is disastrous for the family. He left behind two wives and seven children under the age of 10.To give you an idea of how important a man was to a Mongol family, when a Mongol tribe was raided, the men would grab the fastest horses and head for the hills, leaving the women and children behind. And everyone was okay with this because they knew, okay we can‚Äôt survive without the skills and labor and protection of the men in our tribe.According to The Secret History of the Mongols, the family that Yesugei leaves behind makes permanent camp along the river and Temujin‚Äôs mother, Holun, makes heroic efforts to provide for the family.She was far from her homeland, with no familial ties to fall back on, and too many mouths to feed to make her an attractive prospect to a new husband.You know, I just mentioned how crucial men were to a Mongol family. Well it‚Äôs not like women‚Äôs role was expendable either. Being a woman in a mongol tribe was a very full-time job even when you didn‚Äôt have to take over the responsibilities of your dead husband.So according to the Secret History of the Mongols, Holun is running around night and day just trying to scrape by a meager living.The Secret History tells us that the family had clothing ‚Äúof the skins of dogs and mice, and their food was the flesh of those animals and other dead things.‚ÄùOf course Temujin and the other children are expected to help out as much as they can as well.

Musical cueThe one bright spot for Temujin in this bleak situation is a friendship he strikes up with a boy named Jamuka . One day they play together , and make plans Ghengis Khan (Part 1): to meet up the next to play again. They recognize in each other kindred spirits. They ride together, practice shooting arrows and targets, and play a Mongol game of dice that is played with the knuckle bones of sheep.They were technically very distant cousins through their fathers, but they became such good friends that they carried out a very rare and very serious ritual to make them something called Andas. An Anda was like a brother of your own choosing.The ritual to become Andas involved swearing loyalty to each other, exchanging gifts, sleeping in the same bed, and drinking ‚Äúthe food that could not be digested‚Äù in other words, drinking each other‚Äôs blood.Temujin and Jamuka were eleven when they first became Andas. And they renewed their vow the next year.Again, this was a very serious commitment, and a very serious relationship. Jamuka was the only Anda that Temujin would have in his life. The relationship was intense, and as we shall see, it was one of the most important relationships of his life.In contrast to his relationship with Jamuka, he was beginning to chafe under the authority of his older half-brother, Behter.Under Mongol tradition, Behter was now the man of the house - well they didn‚Äôt have a house - but the man of the family, the patriarch. Never mind that he was only a pre-teen. But this gave him authority to do things like take Temujin‚Äôs hunting kills and divide it up amongst the family.And this really starts to bother Temujin. And this is something that we will see repeatedly throughout his life. He can‚Äôt stand to be the junior partner. He can‚Äôt stand to be the second fiddle. Caesar wrote of himself ‚ÄúFor him, dignitas had always been foremost, and more compelling than life‚Äù and the same could be said for Temujin. He chafed under the thumb of anyone else, he was willing to risk anything for his desire for independence and control, even his own life.Things come to a head one day when Temujin catches a fish. And Behter take it from him, which was his right to do as the oldest man in the clan.

He doesn‚Äôt flinch or try to defend himself. He refused to dignify the situation as a legitimate battle. He was the older brother, with authority over them.He says to them calmly ‚ÄúI am not the lash in your eye, the impediment in your mouth. Without me, you have no companion but your own shadow.‚ÄùBut Temujin and Khasar will not be deterred. Finally, seeing that he is going to die, Behter calmly makes one final wish.

When he gets his freedom , the first thing he does is go look for his old bride , Ghengis Khan (Part 1): Borte. Remember, he was supposed to get engaged to her eight years ago, but his father had died and he had been recalled to be with his family.Well he finds her, and she was a little older than him, she‚Äôs 17 by now, which is almost past marriage age for a Mongol woman at this time. They married very young. But she had been so in love with Temujin that she had waited all these years.Her parents agree to the marriage, which is by the way crazy. I just want to emphasize again what a hypnotic influence he is able to put on these people. Borte has waited for years for a boy she met briefly when they were both pre-pubescent. Her father agrees to the marriage even though Temujin is an escaped slave, still on the run from the law, and can provide no connections or material wealth to his new bride.Now he‚Äôs got a wife, which is good, but he‚Äôs got a problem. How is he going to support her. He has just escaped. He‚Äôs a runaway.He can go back to his mother and siblings down by the river, but it‚Äôs only a matter of time before the Taiyuchids come for him again. And besides, scratching out an existence hunting rats by the river is not how you want to provide for your new wife. But that is where he is at. He has no herds, no goods, no connections, nothing.Well Temujin does have ONE thing. Or rather, She has something.When a couple got married, it was customary for the bride to present her father-in-law with a gift. Well Temujin doesn‚Äôt have a father. So his wife Borte has brought him this beautiful black sable fur coat. It‚Äôs the most prized type of fur on the steppe.And Temujin has the bright idea to take the coat and offer it to a man named Torghil. Torghil was a khan, a tribal chieftain, he was often known as Ong Khan. And Temujin‚Äôs father had served under him as a warrior and had actually helped him take his throne. He was a relatively powerful khan in the area.By offering this bride gift to Ong Khan, Temujin is basically offering to be his surrogate son. Ong Khan is charmed, as is everyone else, accepts the gift, and thereby basically agrees to be his surrogate father.He actually says to him ‚ÄúIn earlier days you and my father agreed to swear brotherhood, so you are almost as a father", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/ghengis-khan-part-1", "title": "Ghengis Khan (Part 1)", "chunk_index": 9, "publication_date": "2023-09-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 24}}

He actually says to him ‚Äú In earlier days you and my father agreed to swear brotherhood , so you are almost as a father Ghengis Khan (Part 1): to me.‚ÄùOng Khan invites him to stay at the court and serve as his vassal, but Temujin, true to form, doesn‚Äôt want to be under anyone‚Äôs sway. So he chooses at this point to go back to his mother and siblings, but now with the implied protection of Ong Khan to keep anyone from messing with him.According to the secret history, Temujin would have preferred this life, living a quiet existence with his new wife and family, making a meager but comfortable living.But he was soon to be revisited by ghosts from the past, which we will hear about after this brief word from our sponsors. *** Tamba ad read *** Temujin had finally risen up to be in a stable, if not very prestigious, position.His camp included his wife, his younger siblings, and a few older women who had become attached to the camp as servants.Then one day, in the very early hours of the morning, The Secret History of the Mongols tells us ‚ÄúThe old woman who worked in the yurt of Mother H√∂el√ºn, rose up and said, ‚ÄòMother! Mother! Rise quickly! The earth is shaking! I can hear the sound of swift horses‚Äô hooves. Mother, rise quickly!‚ÄùWith this many riders this early in the morning, it was clear that they were being raided. Theirs was an odd camp to raid.Everyone who can, catches hold of a horse and rides off. In the chaos, Temujin‚Äôs wife, Borte, is left behind. She is hidden in an ox-cart but the attacking soldiers find her and abduct her.With few cattle and no valuable goods, there wasn‚Äôt much to steal.The raiders had come from the Merkid, the tribe from which Temujin's mother had been abducted 18 years previously. Memories were long on the Mongolian steppe, and perhaps Temujin‚Äôs star had risen enough that people were beginning to hear his name. So the Merkid had come to take their revenge on the boy for the sins of his father.Temujin and his brothers escaped to Burkan Kaldun, the sacred mountain.Three times the Merkids circled the mountains, but Temujin hid in mud and in thickets and they were unable to track him down.Temujin considered it divine intervention from the mountain itself that he was not discovered. After the Merkids had gone, the secret history of the Mongols reports him say:‚ÄúEvery morning I shall sacrifice toBurqan-qaldun, and every day I will pray to it.

He beat his chest with his hand.Kneeling nine times towards the sun, he gave offerings andprayers.‚ÄùThough grateful for his own life, he was also distraught. The Merkids had come with one goal in mind, to steal Borte. In their minds they had dealt justice. A wife for a wife.And Temujin wanted her back.So he rushes down off the mountain and goes to Ong Khan, the man to whom he had given the black sable jacket, tells him the situation, and asks if he will help.Will I help? He says, quote ‚ÄúWhen you placed the coat onme, I spoke these words:In return for the black sable jacketI will bring togetherthe people who abandoned you.In return for the sable jacket,I will unite your scattered people‚ÄùDid I not say those words? Now I will stand by them.In return for the sable jacket,I will crush the Merkidsand rescue Lady B√∂rte for you.In return for the black sable jacket,I will break all the Merkids into piecesand bring back your wife B√∂rte. The raid would, of course, also provide an opportunity for Ong Khan to take plunder from the Merkids. But before he would journey out, he had one request for Temujin. He should ride out and seek assistance from a young ally of his. An enterprising young man who was quickly coming up in the world. A young man named Jamuka. Temujin was to be united with his blood brother once again. The young friend who he had sworn oaths with. Now after six years, reunited.Ong Khan and Temujin bring half of the forces, and Jamuka brings the other half. This is a large invasion force of thousands of horsemen.This united force marches into Merkid territory, and they are much too large to oppose. The Merkid hear about their approach and flee in the night.Temujin‚Äôs force attacks their fleeing camp, and while most men are taking plunder, Temujin rides through the camp shouting Borte‚Äôs name. Not knowing who was attacking, Borte had been hiding. But hearing Temujin‚Äôs voice, she recognizes him and runs out to greet him. They embraced.

In other words, our work here is done. Rapid Ascent and FallThe Point: Temujin displays a remarkable aptitude for leadership, before losing it all On his return, Temujin does not return to his small river site. He has learned his lesson, he‚Äôs in the great game now. And so he decides to team up with Jamuka. He leaves behind the life of a simple hunter, and takes up the life of a herder with Jamuka‚Äôs clan. They renew their vows as blood brothers, saying ‚Äúlet us love one another. And making two lives into one, never forsake each other.‚ÄùFor a year and a half, Jamuka and Temujin work together. The strength of their tribe grows, and Temujin learns the ropes of being a serious herder and living on the open steppe.But over time, something changes. The Secret History of the Mongols doesn‚Äôt say exactly what, but reading between the lines, it seems that Temujin is very naturally talented at leadership.Maybe too talented. Because he grows in popularity, to the point that Jamuka begins to consider him a rival.He begins to put him down, and to make sure to show his authority over him. It‚Äôs very much the same situation as it was with Temujin‚Äôs older half-brother Behter.Temujin and Jamuka would always ride together at the front of the tribe when they moved from pasture to pasture, and then one day Jamuka tells him I‚Äôll take the main camp to the mountain, and you take the sheeps and goats down to the river.Heading up the sheeps and goats was less prestigious than working with the horses, cattle, and oxen. And so he‚Äôs officially saying, we‚Äôre no longer equals, I‚Äôm #1, and you‚Äôre my #2.So seeing that Jamuka is distancing himself, Temujin decides to pre-empt any conflict and leave the tribe in the middle of the night.He takes his followers with him, and undoubtedly some people who had originally been follower‚Äôs of Jamuka decide to throw in their lot with Temujin and leave when he does.Jamuka, perhaps in honor of the friendship that", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/ghengis-khan-part-1", "title": "Ghengis Khan (Part 1)", "chunk_index": 12, "publication_date": "2023-09-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 24}}

He takes his followers with him , and undoubtedly some people who had originally been follower ‚Äô s of Jamuka decide to throw in their lot with Temujin and leave when he does . Jamuka , perhaps in honor of the friendship that Ghengis Khan (Part 1): they had once shared, doesn‚Äôt chase him, and allows him to leave with his followers.They were both about 19 years old when this split happens.Temujin moves his followers to some grasslands not too far away, and over the years, Temujin would go from brothers to rivals, to the bitterest of enemies.It began with your basic cattle raiding and skirmishing. Stealing animals and women, maybe killing a couple of each other‚Äôs followers. But over time the scale of the skirmishes is starting to grow into outright battles.Temujin realizes that he has a problem. Jamuka is trying to be a khan, or chieftain, whereas at this point Temujin is only trying to resist Jamuka.So Jamuka is growing in strength over time as more people are attracted to following this khan.And so eight years after their initial split, Temujin declares himself khan in order to try to attract more followers.Now at this time, he is still a vassal to Ong Khan, so he sends him a note explaining that he is only trying to unite the Mongol tribes under the leadership of Ong Khan and his tribe, called the Kereits. And Ong Khan agreed to this. He was friendly with both Temujin and Jamuka so he tried not to take sides in the whole thing. He says, okay yeah, you can both call yourself khan of the mongols, I just don‚Äôt want to pick sides.Soon this has a sort of gravitational pull. Everyone needs to side with either Jamuka or Temujin, because they are getting so powerful that if you are unaffiliated you‚Äôre in real danger. So all the smaller tribes are joining Temujin or Jamuka, and Jamuka tends to get the more aristocratic tribes, those with a more refined and noble lineage, whereas Temujin is picking up more followers from the lower classes.And the two are locked into a stalemate for years, Finally in 1187, things come to a head. Temujin gathers his forces and Jamuka gathers his, and they meet at the battle of Dalan Baljut.*** Sound Effects ***The forces are relatively evenly matched. They clash again and again, riding toward each other, firing arrows, and retreating and reloading.For much of the day the armies are locked in a stalemate, but things begin to turn against Temujin.

Jamuka takes one of Temujin ‚Äô s commanders and cuts off his head and ties it to his horses tail and Ghengis Khan (Part 1): drags it around. It‚Äôs also reported that he has 70 men boiled alive, which was especially bad in Mongol culture because this would not only kill the man in a very tortuous manner but damaging their body so severely would destroy their soul.With Jamuka ascendant, Temujin must flee from Mongolia altogether. He teams up with Ong Khan, He embarks on some other fights, he teams up with Ong Khan to invade the Tatars. This part of his life is a little mysterious, he might have been in captivity to the Chinese Jin dynasty, hard to know what is happening.What is clear is that he is essentially a mercenary and he‚Äôs improving his skills as a warrior and a tactician.In takes about a decade before he has secured enough wealth and experience for him to re-enter the ring.When he returns to the steppe in 1196, things progress quickly. Many of the people who had been with him before, return to his side. And he gains some new converts as well, Jamuka‚Äôs brutal killings after their battle a decade earlier had weakened support for him. Many of the people who were turned off by this brutality now supported Temujin.Having said that, Temujin doesn‚Äôt immediately try to attack Jamuka. First he defeats the Jurkin tribe, then the Merkits, and then raids two very powerful tribes: the Naimans, and the Tatars.As Temujin grows in power, a number of tribes throw their lot in with Jamuka to try to stop him. And inevitably, this culminates in another large battle.Both sides gather their forces and camp them nearby one another.The leadup to a large Mongol battle was a dramatic affair. The warriors would post their spirit banners, which were said to carry the spirits of their ancestors. They would make sacrifices, and shamans would foretell their good fortunes in the coming battle. Well Temujin went all-out in recruiting the best and most famous shamans and creating a big spectacle on his side. The night before the battle, when a thunderstorm arose, everyone on both asides assumed it was because the gods were with Temujin, and Jamuka‚Äôs forces fled.When they finally do catch up and give battle, Jamuka‚Äôs forces give a better showing than expected. Temujin himself is wounded with an arrow to the neck.

The Mongols had a weird thing with blood , they didn ‚Äô t like to see it or come into contact with Ghengis Khan (Part 1): it. My kind of people. We have that in common, I love the Mongols for that.But this follower drinks the blood from Temujin‚Äôs neck until he is literally so full he can‚Äôt drink anymore. Then and only then, Jelme, begins to spit out the blood on the ground.Then Temujin rouses from his sleep enough to ask for a certain type of food which they don‚Äôt have, so Jlme sneaks into the enemy camp and steals some food and brings it back.And then my favorite part is... In the morning, Temujin fully wakes up. And he asks what happened and Jelme tells him the story. And he looks around, looks down and sees the blood on the ground, and says, and this is a quote from the Secret History ‚ÄúWould it [not] have been [better] to spit it further [away]?Real Rodney Dangerfield moment for poor Jelme. No respect.Well more or less fully recovered from his neck wound, Temujin is able to lead his forces to victory the next day but Jamuka escapes.Temujin carries out a policy that he had been developing for a while. He kills the leaders of the opposition, but absorbs the rest of their people into his burgeoning khanate.In his next campaign he defeats an even larger and more powerful clan, the Tatars. And so he‚Äôs forced to be a little more brutal with them. He has all the men walk past a wagon wheel, and anyone taller than the wheel, which was the symbolic height of adulthood, is executed whereas everyone else is allowed to live and incorporated into Temujin‚Äôs growing clan.And it‚Äôs around this time when he starts incorporating a number of important reforms that would strengthen his rule.First of all, tribes were typically arranged by kinship. You would have a khan, and the main leaders under him would be his closest relations, his brothers and direct cousins and so on.Well Temujin arranges a court with a dozen top lieutenants who are assigned completely based on skill and loyalty without reference to their familial ties to Temujin. This provides a very capable officer core that he could rely on, which no one else had.And Temujin was able to do this, in part, because he came from such a poor and neglected background, he didn‚Äôt have dozens of cousins who were expecting prominent placement in his court.Secondly, as mentioned he begins to completely incorporate new tribes into his burgeoning kingdom.

Secondly , as mentioned he begins to completely incorporate new tribes into his burgeoning kingdom . Normally , you came , you raided , you killed some people , you took Ghengis Khan (Part 1): some stuff, and you left.Well Temujin comes in, he executes the top leaders, and the rest of the people he resettles among the rest of his tribes. This means that they don‚Äôt have the cohesiveness to group up and rebel, because their previous friends and relations are scattered far away in different parts of the territory, but at the same time every conquest adds to his numbers and his power.He will typically even have his mother adopt a boy from the new tribe. And this boy wouldn‚Äôt be raised as a slave or a servant but as a full-fledged member of the family to show that hey, you guys are family now. One of your own is my little brother now. You‚Äôre not a Tayuichid or a Merkid or whatever, you‚Äôre a Mongol now. You‚Äôre a part of the tribe.By the way this is a classic tactic of great conquerors, most famously utilized by Alexander the Great and his father Philip. Philip in particular was famous for this, it was said that he moved peoples the way a shepherd moves his sheep. And if you look at someone like Napoleon, his failure to do this is part of what doomed him. If he had resettled the elites of societies everywhere he conquered and formed a new pan-European elite class, then things might have turned out very different for him.The third thing Temujin does is reform the way they conduct war. So normally you invade, the men flee, you take the stuff, the men go summon their allies, and then they would chase you down and attack you as you were leaving with their stuff. Or not, if you attacked in large enough numbers, you just got the stuff. But there was this big rush to take spoils, and that is part of what made it so easy for the conquered to flee and form up to attack later.Well, Temujin says no, all spoils come to me, and I will distribute them. And a big part of that distribution was based on performance in the battle.But what this meant was that the men would not get distracted by booty, by loot. They were now all focused on defeating the enemy. So that meant bigger victories with more lasting results. None of these victories where the enemy just ran away and got a chance to regroup.The last thing he does is something that he would become very famous for.

But if you resist, and we beat you, we‚Äôre going to be very cruel. Executions, torture, you name it. And that creates a strong incentive to capitulate. So victories beget more victories, ones that don‚Äôt even require fighting.The central theme of these reforms is first, centralization. That is a theme of all great leaders, from Alexander the Great to Steve Jobs. They break down competing power structures and centralize everything on themselves. For Alexander that meant doing the same thing as Temujin: Breaking up clans and resettling the people. Breaking down traditional tribal power structures. For Steve Jobs that meant breaking down these really strong product groups and creating cross-product functional departments that all reported to him. And look, you see this with Caesar, with Brigham Young, with Hearst, with a bunch of people we have talked about on this show.And the second thing you see in these reforms is that they really focus on the first two missions of a CEO, as outlined by Steve Jobs. The first is hiring the right people. So Temujin is saying I‚Äôm going to hire based on merit, rather than familial connection. The second is setting the course, setting the vision. And Temujin is saying hey, we are all going to get on the same page with building up this united Mongol khanate. And to that end, we are all going to get on the same page with winning these battles and not taking loot.So I think it‚Äôs a little goofy to take management lessons from Genghis Khan, but it‚Äôs actually interesting to see the same leadership lessons play out in such an alien context. I feel like it really does reinforce how timeless some of these lessons are.So with Jamuka out of power and fleeing to a border kingdom, there were only three powers left on the steppe. There was Temujin and his people, there was Ong Khan and his tribe called the Kereit, and the Naiman to the west.So he first tries to take out one of the tribes, the Kereit, through diplomacy.He proposes to Ong Khan, hey, let me marry my oldest son to your daughter. And that is essentially a proposal to peacefully acquire his kingdom. Well, Ong Khan is at this point becoming quite wary of Temujin‚Äôs rise, and so he tries to lure him into a trap.He says, sure, come marry your son to my daughter, we‚Äôll do the wedding here in my territory.

But it ‚Äô s a trap and Ghengis Khan (Part 1): he‚Äôs actually planning to kill Temujin. Luckily, Temujin is tipped off by a couple local herders who see what is happening. He quickly tries to gather some troops but they don‚Äôt have enough time and are badly beaten by Ong Khan‚Äôs much larger force, and Temujin is forced to beat a hasty retreat.Temujin had gained so much, but now at this moment, he was on the verge of losing it all. Once he had escaped the pursuit of Ong Khan‚Äôs men, Temujin had a moment to pray and to think about his situation. He was on the run, and his forces were scattered. There were still enough of them to oppose Ong Khan, but in this moment of confusion and doubt, the question was: would they remain loyal?He had a few companions with him. They came from nine different tribes, from different lands, and belonged to different religions, including Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity. He asked them what they thought. And they expressed their unwavering support.In this crucial moment, a wild horse stumbled into their camp. And Temujin and his supporters took this as a sign of divine favor. The hungry men butchered the horse and ate it.‚ÄúAfter the meal, Temujin a cup of the muddy river water as a toast. He thanked his men for their loyalty, and swore never to forget it. The men shared in drinking the muddy waters, and swore eternal allegiance to him.‚ÄùThese are supposedly the actual words of the covenant, according to the secret history of the mongols. It shows what an inspirational leader he was (I‚Äôm quoting again) ‚Äú[Tem√ºjin] raised his hands and looking up at Heaven swore, saying \"If I am able to achieve my \"Great Work\", I shall [always] share with you men the sweet and the bitter.

Temujin advances on the feast at a breakneck speed in what he calls a lightning Ghengis Khan (Part 1): advance, literally a blitzkrieg. He‚Äôs on Ong Khan and his men before they know what is coming, and before they have a chance to prepare.Even so, Temujin had rushed to battle with a skeleton army, and the forces are relativelly evenly matched.There are three days of fighting, through which Ong Khan slowly bleeds men to Temujin. Not so much through killing but through defection. They knew that Temujin was harsh to the defeated, but clement to those who surrendered, so there is this incentive to give yourself up.In the end, Weatherford writes in Genghis Khan and the making of the modern world, ‚ÄúOng Khan‚Äôs army was not so much defeated as swallowed by Temujin‚Äôs forces.‚ÄùOng Khan himself escapes for a while but dies shortly thereafter and Jamuka escapes with any remaining loyal men to the one remaining independent tribe, the Naiman. They were a powerful confederation, and very wealthy, and they looked down on the Mongols as poor and backwards.Temujin uses this disdain to fire up his men and motivate them for the war to come.The final battle for control of all Mongolia occurs in 1204. The Battle of Chakirmaut.It is Temujin and his forces against the Naiman, and with them Jamuka and his few remaining forces. And really anyone who was still around and could muster the courage to oppose Temujin joins the Naiman.This would be the largest and most important steppe battle in living history.First Temujin attacks with something called the Tumbleweed formation. Groups of ten attack the enemy seemingly at random, and disperse before they can be chased. Then he forms his men into something called lake formation. He stretches his forces out into a long line, a few rows deep. One row rides up, shoots their arrows, then rides off to the sides to make way for the next line and then they form up again in the back to cycle through, endless waves of men attacking like waves on the shore of a lake.This has the effect of spreading out the Naiman forces, who lengthen their line to meet him. So then he forms his men into what he calls chisel formation, where they now concentrate in a narrow, deep formation and fire at a single point on the enemy‚Äôs now stretched line until they break through.They don‚Äôt completely destroy the Naiman forces, but they are so demoralized by this defeat that many attempt to flee in the night.

Jamuka Ghengis Khan (Part 1): escapes once again, and tries to live a life as a bandit, but in the coming months is betrayed by his men and brought before Temujin.Temujin is outraged by the traitors, and has them killed. According to the Secret History, Jamuka met a prosaic end, some might say too prosaic to be believed. Supposedly he and Temujin reconciled, and Temujin invited him to be a brother to him once again. ‚ÄúWe are joined together once again. We should remind each other of things we have forgotten - wake each other from our sleep.

Kill me and lay down my dead bones in the high ground. Then, eternally, and forever, I will protect the seed of your seed and become a blessing for them.

{"text": ". ‚Äú Days of great solemnity and massive ceremony alternated with days of celebration , sports , and music . The court shamans pounded their drums and sang by day . The musicians performed at dusk . The night air filled with mesmerizing drones of the distinctive type of Mongol Ghengis Khan (Part 1): throat singing or overtone singing, in which men make sounds so deep inside their bodies, they can follow two musical lines simultaneously. Young people competed in wrestling, horse racing, and archery.He controlled a territory. Roughly the size of modern Western Europe, but with a population of about a million people and probably some 15 to 20 million animals.The motion was put forward, would they accept Temujin as their leader, and unanimously they raised their voice in support.He took on the title of the ruler of all people of the felt walls, in other words anyone who lived on the steppe, anyone who lived in a tent.And they chose a new name for him, one that had already been circulating. From that day, he would be known as the strong chief. The Chingis Khan.*** SOUND EFFECT *** So briefly before we end, what can be learned from this story?Well there are the lessons we already discussed. Centralization. Make it very good to ally with you and very bad to defy you. This is actually something that Mark Zuckerberg does really well. People know that if Mark offers to acquire you, you‚Äôre going to get pretty good terms. But if you turn down the acquisition, he‚Äôs going to turn the eye of sauron on you and copy your product and try to drive you out of business.There is surrounding yourself with the best and most capable people possible.There is also the power of mystique. Remember on the even of battle how he gets the best and most respected shamans on his side so that when a thunderstorm strikes, everyone believes that it must be a sign that the gods are on his side.I think developing that sense of mystique is really powerful. And people might not believe in the gods of thunder anymore, but they still believe in the favor of the gods, in being touched by teh finger of god, by another name. Call it inertia, call it momentum, call it a sense of destiny or good juju. This was probably best encapsulated in current times by Steve Jobs, who had such a run from 1998 through 2011 that he seemed unstoppable.Well, tune in next time to hear the real action, how Genghis Khan turns the Mongol people outward, and conquers an empire the likes of which the world had never seen.Until then, thanks for listening to how to take over the world. ‚ÄòI leave my sonas a son-in-law, but he is afraid of dogs.

Speaking of his global impact, I‚Äôll just address the question of atrocities. Because there are some who have suggested that he killed so many people that it lowered the carbon output and therefore affected global temperatures. That‚Äôs disputed but it is true that he killed a lot of people. And rape was a big part of mongol conquests as well, just like any conquest.Dan Carlin has a series on Hardcore History called the Wrath of the Khans where he makes the case that Genghis Khan is just Hitler. We‚Äôve had 900 years to forget his atrocities so it doesn‚Äôt seem so bad to us now, but basically Genghis Khan was Hitler.And then you say well yeah, but every other conqueror killed lots of people too and Dan‚Äôs response is well they‚Äôre all Hitler too.

{"text": "Alexander the Great (Part 2): Alexander Part 2 Script HELLO, and welcome to How to Take Over the World. I‚Äôm back, with part 2 of the life of Alexander the Great. I‚Äôd like to start with an analogy, if that‚Äôs alright. In Chelyabinsk Russia, the 15th of February, 2013, started just like any other normal freezing winter day. It was a Friday, and many people were still on their way to work when they saw a bright light in the sky. As it streaked across the sky, it got brighter and brighter until it was brighter even than the mid-morning sun. It then winked out. Several minutes later, there was a deafening boom and people standing outside felt a wave of heat wash over them. All across the city, people were knocked over by an unseen wave and thousands of windows shattered. And then it was over, the only evidence that anything had happened was a slight odor that people described as smelling like gunpowder or sulphur. Hundreds of people were injured but miraculously, no one was killed. It turned out that miles above them, an asteroid had hit the atmosphere with such speed that it released an explosion over 30 times greater than the nuclear bomb that destroyed Hirsohima. It was the largest asteroid to hit earth in over a hundred years. And luckily for the residents of Chelyabinsk, the blast happened so high in the atmosphere, that they only felt the very edges of that explosion. But it must have been an incredibly bizarre thing to experience. Something brighter than the sun suddenly appears in the sky. A phenomenon that no living human had experienced. And then boom and then it‚Äôs over. Go about your life like nothing ever happened, I guess. The life of Alexander the Great is kind of like that. He explodes onto the world scene, conquers everyone in sight, establishes the largest empire the world has ever seen and then right as he is coming into the height of his powers, he dies. And sorry, spoiler alert, the empire basically disappears. And just like the residents of Chelyabinsk in 2013, we are left wondering how to account for it. So on this episode I‚Äôll try to explain how such a magnificent empire could arise so quickly, and obviously what personal attributes of Alexander enabled him to be the one to do it, and then how it all came apart so quickly. But before we get into it, here‚Äôs a brief word from our sponsors. *** Insert Cold Plunge ad read **** Quick recap on where we‚Äôre at:", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/alexander-the-great-part-2", "title": "Alexander the Great (Part 2)", "chunk_index": 0, "publication_date": "2021-11-19", "total_chunks_in_doc": 18}}
{"text": "it , and then how it all came apart so quickly . But before we get into it , here ‚Äô s a brief word from our sponsors . * * * Insert Cold Plunge ad read * * * * Quick recap on where we ‚Äô re at : Alexander the Great (Part 2): Alexander grows up in Macedonia, takes over as king when his father dies, mops some things up back home, then invades the Persian empire. He scores a major victory at the Battle of the Granicus River which wins him all of Asia minor, modern day Turkey, and then he wins another large battle, the battle of Issus, and for the first time he has defeated the fully assembled army of the Persian empire, and now appears to be a significant threat. Tyre After winning the battle of Issus, Alexander‚Äôs most important task was to ensure that the Persian could no longer threaten him from the sea. He had beaten them at Granicus, and beaten Darius himself at Issus, but the whole time a Persian fleet had been harassing his Greek allies and threatening to link up with the Spartans, who never joined Alexander‚Äôs League of Corinth, and potentially join them in an invasion of Greece or Macedonia. So you can imagine that there is a scenario where Alexander is winning battle after battle in Persia, but it doesn‚Äôt matter because his home territory is invaded by sea because he basically doesn‚Äôt have a navy. Well it turns out that most of the Persian navy operated from Phoenicia, which is basically modern day Lebanon. So after Issus, Alexander marches through Phoenicia. And without the Persian army there to protect them, most of the Phonecians surrender to Alexander, and turn over their cities, including their pots and their fleets. But they have one city that doesn‚Äôt do this, called Tyre. And Tyre is in fact the wealthiest and most important city in Phoenicia, so it‚Äôs a big problem that they won‚Äôt surrender to him. They won‚Äôt surrender because they want to remain neutral, and because they basically think that their city is impossible to besiege, so there‚Äôs nothing Alexander can do about it anyway. Tyre was on a little island just barely off the coast, and it was wealthy, well-supplied, and had big walls surrounding it. And so legitimately, if you‚Äôre Alexander, what do you do? How do you besiege a city that has enough supplies to last for years, is able to resupply itself from the sea, and has no land around it where you can bring up battering rams or siege engines? What would you do? This is a difficult circumstance, and every proposal is going to seem crazy, but Alexander‚Äôs suggestion is perhaps the craziest of all. He wants to change the literal landscape.

He wants to change the literal landscape . His plan is to shovel and build and connect the island to Alexander the Great (Part 2): the mainland. Not just by building a bridge, mind you, but by actually connecting it with stone and dirt so that it‚Äôs no longer an island. So he sets his men to building this what‚Äôs called a mole. Basically a land bridge. And Tyre is about a kilometer from the shore, so they have to build a kilometer long mole. And at first the soldiers and sailors in Tyre are just laughing at them. But day after day they‚Äôre making progress and the Tyrians start to think: Okay this is still probably crazy, but maybe we should start to take this seriously. A game of chess ensues where each side is coming up with new tactics every day to match and beat out the other side. A game of cat and mouse. We‚Äôre going to shoot arrows at your workers so they can‚Äôt keep building this mole. Okay, then we‚Äôll build wicker walls for the builders to work behind. Okay, then we‚Äôll set our arrows on fire to burn the wicker walls. Alright, then we‚Äôll douse the wicker in water. Then we will launch a surprise raid to destroy your work. Then we‚Äôll start building towers along the mole and post guards. And so on and so forth. This goes on for seven months. And throughout it, this land bridge is slowly getting longer and longer. And at the end of it they‚Äôre able to roll up some siege engines, and in conjunction with an assault by sea, get over the walls and destroy and subdue Tyre. Now this story is remarkable to me because it‚Äôs almost the opposite of what we came to expect from Alexander based on the first episode. The main theme that I pulled out of episode 1 was cutting the Gordian knot. Finding the simple solution that cuts through the noise and gets the end objective accomplished FAST. Well this is the opposite of that. Here he is literally moving heaven and earth. It‚Äôs a slow and technically complicated solution that uses brute force rather than cleverness. It reminds me of Edison. His early inventions all hit him like a bolt of lightning. They‚Äôre new, clever ways to solve problems that no one could have ever imagined. But then he gets to the lightbulb, and he has no flashes of brilliance. He actually thinks he does early on but it doesn‚Äôt work. And so his process for solving the problem of a lightbulb is to just try thousands of designs to see what will work.

But if I can‚Äôt find that or if it doesn‚Äôt exist, I‚Äôm just going to sit here and chip away at it and be patient and solve the problem through sheer grit and by bringing more resources to bear than my opposition. Egypt After conquering Tyre, Alexander turns his eye toward Egypt. Egypt was always important, it was a wealthy territory, it was basically the bread basket of the middle east and eastern mediterranean, the Nile river valley was extremely fertile and provided a lot of grain. And luckily for Alexander, they‚Äôre basically inviting him in. He just has to go collect it. The Persian kings had disrespected the local religious traditions, and so the Egyptians were ready to be done with them. Plus there was really nothing that King Darius could do at this point, Alexander was between him and Egypt and there was nothing he could do to stop Alexander from taking it. Alexander is of course over the top in his observance of their religious rites. As part of that, he becomes not just king of Egypt, but pharaoh. And that title is a deitific, meaning he is considered not only a ruler, but a god. As I‚Äôve noted before, Alexander made these religious observances, not just for cynical reasons, but it appears that he was a genuinely pious and religious person himself. When he first comes to Egypt he of course does all the necessary stuff of installing a satrap and doing some basic government reforms, but he soon takes a journey to a tiny little Oasis town called Siwa in order to visit a very famous oracle there: The god of Am≈´n or Ammon. Siwa was famous for their god Ammon, even though it was an insignificant town. I mean it‚Äôs literally in the middle of nowhere. NOTHING around. It‚Äôs on the border of modern day Egypt and Libya, and if you look at it on a map you‚Äôll see that it‚Äôs just sand for hundreds of miles in every direction. So this town had no military, political, or economic significance Because Siwa was so remote, they had been separate from Egyptian civilization and culture for millenia, and that is why they had their own gods. And I think that made their gods seem kind of exotic.

They were foreign , from this weird little civilization that was on the one Alexander the Great (Part 2): hand pretty close but on the other hand really weird and foreign because they were these desert people. Of course over the years the Egyptians had recognized Ammon as similar to their sun god Ra and had combined the two, which they referred to as Amun-Ra. And if you ever see any old movies like the mummy, you‚Äôll see an old-timey Egyptian priest in a very serious tone invoking ‚Äúin the name of Amun-ra I summon you from your grave.‚Äù or something like that. This hybrid god Amun-Ra was very important and still survives on in pop culture. Similarly, the Greeks were very impressed by Amun and they saw him as similar to Zeus so they referred to the combined deity as Amun-Zeus. So Alexander goes to see the oracle of Amun-Zeus at Siwa and he has to march through days in the desert to get there. His party almost gets lost and dies in the desert. And again, there is no strategic advantage to this. He‚Äôs risking his life because he really wants to see this cool thing and have this cool experience. And some historians try to say that there must actually be some political reason why he did this. He‚Äôs making this visit to legitimize his rule in Egypt or for future propaganda use among the Greeks. And I just think that that‚Äôs way off. And I hate the attempt to imbue every action in history with this monomaniacal pursuit of geopolitical power. Humans were humans and they did things for power, but they also did things for other reasons: For wonder or curiosity or love or loyalty or lust or hate or simple enjoyment and all other manner of reasons. And that‚Äôs especially true of Alexander‚Äôs story. He was someone of really strong emotions and strong will. I definitely think it‚Äôs a mistake to just see him as a force of nature - the manifestation of economic and geopolitical forces greater than himself. He had a human will and he was able to impose it on the world. So Alexander goes to Siwa and is able to ask the oracle a question. We don‚Äôt know what he actually asked the oracle, though later reports would claim that he asked if his father‚Äôs murderer had been avenged, and the oracle responded that he was asking the wrong question, since his father was not a mortal. That he was not the son of Philip, but of Amun-Zeus. While this is probably a later invention, he does apparently have a deeply affecting visit to the oracle.

While this is probably a later invention , he does apparently have a deeply affecting visit to the oracle . And ever - after , Alexander the Great (Part 2): he would refer to himself as the son of Amun-Zeus. Now some people think that this mean‚Äôs Alexander considered himself a son of a god, that he believed that Philip was not his true father. That he believed that a thunderbolt from Zeus had actually come down from Zeus and impregnated his mother. But this is not true. Alexander always referred to Phililp as his father. When he called himself the son of Amun-Zeus, he was referring to a more distant connection. Through his family history he was supposedly descended from Hercules, who was the son of Zeus. So his allusions to being the son of Amun-Zeus is more a reference to that genealogy, and not any belief that he was in any real sense divine. Afterwards, after this visit to Siwa, he returns to Egypt proper, finishes settling his affairs, and founds a new port city which he would name Alexandria, after himself. So while he may not have believed that he was the literal son of god, there was still plenty of ego. Gaugamela While in Egypt, Alexander hears that Darius has been busy fielding a new army. From the Persian perspective, Granicus was nothing more than a skirmish, and the battle of Issus could be explained away as the Persians having under-estimated Alexander and being hasty and sloppy. But now, well NOW the Persians had the full force of their army. They were bringing in soldiers from Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Armenia, and Iraq, they were bringing the full weight of the Persian cavalry, they were even bringing fearsome war elephants all the way from India. And furthermore, they are waiting for Alexander. This time they are committed to fighting on friendly territory in a setting that will be advantageous to them. They are sitting in an open plain in northern Iraq near a tiny village called Gaugamela, near the modern-day Iraqi city of Mosul. With an open plain, they could use their superior numbers to surround and overwhelm Alexander‚Äôs much smaller army. We don‚Äôt know exactly how much smaller it was, but most modern scholar‚Äôs estimate that it was about half the size of Darius‚Äôs. Probably 100,000 Persian soldiers to 50,000 Macedonians. Alexander takes the bait. He promptly marches his army from Egypt to Babylon. Unlike the previous battles, you can tell that Alexander is slightly intimidated by this massive Persian army. Because unlike the other battles, he doesn‚Äôt immediately attack. He takes a few days to draw up plans and prepare, which is a little unlike him.

{"text": ", you can tell that Alexander is slightly intimidated by this massive Persian army . Because unlike the other battles , he doesn ‚Äô t immediately attack . He takes a few days to draw up plans and prepare , which is a little unlike him . The Persian plan Alexander the Great (Part 2): was obvious to Alexander and his commanders. They would use heavy chariots to break up the Macedonian infantry, and then use their numerical advantage of cavalry to surround and flank them. Parmenion, seeing how difficult it would be to beat this massive army on their own chosen ground, encouraged Alexander to launch a night attack. But Alexander doesn‚Äôt go for it. He didn‚Äôt want anyone to be able to say that he had stolen the victory and illegitimately won the Persian empire through trickery. Like all great generals, he‚Äôs always thinking beyond the X‚Äôs and O‚Äôs. He‚Äôs thinking not just about the tactics, but the psychology. And it‚Äôs going to be hard to rule an empire if everyone thinks you stole it by being conniving and sneaky. So he arranges a much more straightforward strategy. Alexander arranges his troops much as he did at Issus, with the infantry in the middle and his cavalry on the wings, with his most elite troops - the shield bearers and the companion cavalry - on the right side, with him personally leading them companions. Unlike at Issus, Alexander kept a second line of infantry in reserve in order to meet any flanking maneuvers. Alexander attacks, having his men move at an angle to the right. The Macedonian infantry dealt with the chariot charges well, opening up their ranks when necessary to allow the chariots to pass harmlessly through. A lot of the details of this battle are missing, because even at the time, people didn‚Äôt know what was happening. It was a big flat battlefield on a dusty plain and the horses running around are kicking up dust so no one can really see what is happening from an overall cohesive battle perspective. You have individual squadrons of cavalry charging and counter-charging each other on both the Macedonian and Persian sides. You can imagine it must have been terrifying, you can‚Äôt see anything but you hear the clash of steel, men‚Äôs battle cries and horses running around in every direction. And you never know what a squadron are going to come screaming out of the dust right on top of you before you even know what‚Äôs happening. But despite the overall uncertainty, we do know some things that happened in the battle of Gaugamela. And the battle unfolded in a very familiar way if you can think back to the battle of Issus. Alexander‚Äôs left flank, led by Parmenion, is seriously threatened and fairing poorly when Alexander on the right side of the line, notices a weak spot in the Persian line, and charges straight through it", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/alexander-the-great-part-2", "title": "Alexander the Great (Part 2)", "chunk_index": 6, "publication_date": "2021-11-19", "total_chunks_in_doc": 18}}
{"text": "you can think back to the battle of Issus . Alexander ‚Äô s left flank , led by Parmenion , is seriously threatened and fairing poorly when Alexander on the right side of the line , notices a weak spot in the Persian line , and charges straight through it Alexander the Great (Part 2): with the companion cavalry. They burst through, and head straight for King Darius, who turns and flees AGAIN. And just like at the Battle of Issus, this flight of their king and leader sends the Persian army into a general retreat. Once again, Alexander is unable to pursue Darius for as long as he would like because he needs to turn back and support Parmenion‚Äôs left wing from being overrun. Alexander had lost very few men, perhaps 500. And while we don‚Äôt have accurate numbers of the Persian casualties, it‚Äôs in the tens of thousands. The Persian army was crushed. While Darius would still need to be pursued and captured, the war was basically over. After the battle of Gaugamela, Alexander was the new master of the Persian empire. I just need to point out that this strategy of taking advantage of the pivotal moment is really common among great generals. Napoleon was really great at it, he generally won his battles late in the day after the other side was tired and he would charge his most elite units against the weakest part of their line and break through and break the enemy army. Julius Caesar was also great at it, and in fact, the Romans basically systematized and institutionalized this style of fighting. Whereas most armies would deploy the vast majority of their forces right from the beginning, the Romans would typically have three rows to their army, and only deploy the first at the beginning, so that they had plenty of reserves that they could hit their enemy with throughout the battle and kind of shock them. And last thing, and I know I‚Äôve brought this up before, the basketball team the Golden State Warriors circa 2015-2016 had this lineup that was called the death lineup. And it was unstoppable. When they played these five players together, they would just demolish teams.

{"text": "he was intentionally mimicking Alexander the Great and Napoleon but he was very much using the same strategy as them . There does seem to be something about wearing your opponent down first , keeping some fuel in the tank , something in reserve , and then unleashing it on Alexander the Great (Part 2): them once they‚Äôre tired. It‚Äôs really demoralizing when it happens, and a great way to break the competition. Taking Persia After Gaugemela, Alexander quickly establishes control over the main power centers of the Persian empire. He enters Babylon and takes control. Archaeologists have found some pretty funny temple records from this time. Darius is described as the king of the world on the morning of Gaugamela. A few days later, the record reads ‚ÄúAlexander, king of the world, entered Babylon.‚Äù So you can see how Alexander‚Äôs strategy of continuity was paying off, it was very easy for people like the Babylonians to just accept that there was now a new king of the world. He then marches to Susa, the administrative center of the Persian empire, and captures it without resistance, and seizes their treasury., but otherwise leaves it untouched and undamaged. He then marches to Persepolis, which was the ceremonial seat of the Achaemenids, the ruling dynasty of the Persian empire. Remember he‚Äôs basically running for king of Persia, if you want to think of it as an election, on the platform of continuity. That‚Äôs why he left Susa completely untouched, it was the administrative capital of his new empire. But Perspeolis was different, it represented, not the actual empire, but the dynasty of Darius, the Achaemenids, the guys that had ruled before Alexander. And so Alexander lets his men run amok and completely pillage the city. He has the treasury completely emptied and taken back to Susa. And then Alexander does one of the most controversial things of his entire reign and burns the city down. Arrian says that Alexander made a calculated decision to burn Persepolis as revenge for past Persian incursions into Greece. Diodorus relates that Alexander was up partying with his companions - and he had a few drinks in him - when he was convinced to light the city on fire by a prostitute. In either case, it seems that Alexander soon regretted the decision. While it did damage Achaemenid prestige, and really made the idea of Darius somehow making a comeback as king impossible, it also created a rift with his Persian subjects. He was disrespecting their traditions and their sacred symbols in the most egregious way possible. The Chase In any case, word soon came that Darius was gathering forces in the far eastern reaches of the empire. He was no longer able to muster a force that could even come close to challenging Alexander, who was for all intents and purposes now the king of Greece, Macedonia, and the entire Persian empire. But the fear was that if", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/alexander-the-great-part-2", "title": "Alexander the Great (Part 2)", "chunk_index": 8, "publication_date": "2021-11-19", "total_chunks_in_doc": 18}}

He was no longer able to muster a force that could even come close to challenging Alexander , who was for all intents and purposes now the king of Greece , Macedonia , and the entire Persian empire . But the fear was that if Alexander the Great (Part 2): he continued to hang out on the periphery with a ragtag group of forces, perhaps that might inspire other areas to eventually rebel and join him. So Alexander furiously pursues Darius through these northern regions in modern Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. It‚Äôs interesting, he really pushes his men hard, force marching them, having them charge headlong into defensive enemy positions instead of waiting. You can tell he‚Äôs really impatient to capture Darius and have this thing 100% done with. I think there‚Äôs a lesson there about never leaving a thing mostly done. Even if it‚Äôs 99%. You gotta wrap it up 100%. Eventually Darius is betrayed by one of his top generals, a man by the name of Bessus. Bessus stabs Darius and leaves him for dead. This really upsets Alexander, who wanted to capture Darius alive so that he could get the official handoff. So that he could basically force Darius to tell everyone ‚ÄúHey guys listen up. Alexander is the new king.‚Äù So Alexander is really upset at this Bessus guy, and when he eventually catches up and captures Bessus, he has his ears and nose cut off, and sends him off to be executed. And with that, Alexander is really and truly the unchallenged king of Persia. A Melting Pot With the war won, Alexander‚Äôs men prepare to head home. But Alexander wasn‚Äôt done. And he‚Äôs frustrated that his men aren‚Äôt as enthusiastic about the prospects of further conquest as he was. And he‚Äôs got other issues. He‚Äôs now got this international, multicultural, diverse empire. And problematically, it‚Äôs got two centers of power. The Greeks and the Persians. He couldn‚Äôt rule as a purely Greek ruler if he meant to maintain the loyalty of his eastern subjects. The methods of ruling were just way too foreign. Greece was very egalitarian compared to Asia. In Greece Alexander was first among peers, but in Asia, he was expected to be above everyone else. Almost a god. The Persian king actually wasn‚Äôt technically considered a god but it was pretty close. And you might think, well okay but are they really going to care if he treats them better. If he acts more humble, as the Greeks wanted. Surely everyone would want that, right?

I‚Äôm pretty bad at basketball.‚Äù Well, okay, that‚Äôs nice that you‚Äôre being humble I guess but what does that say about me??? And that‚Äôs how everyone in the Persian empire felt, it‚Äôs okay if you get beat by someone who‚Äôs a regal, semi-divine, force of nature. But if this Greek comes over and beats all your armies and starts acting like, actually, I‚Äôm just a guy like everyone else, I‚Äôm not that special‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs actually insulting. But alternatively Greeks were very egalitarian, very democratic, and they did not take well to anyone lording power over them. Greek states were built on the idea of sharing power, and they were very sensitive to tyranny or despotism. So Alexander is in a real pickle. His first instinct is to try to split the difference. He began dressing in a mixed way, combining Macedonian and Persian garments. He took an eastern style harem with a different concubine for every day of the year, but he didn‚Äôt actually make use of it. He also allowed certain Persian nobles to continue to serve as administrators and advisors, but mostly kept his senior positions filled with Greeks. Most troublingly to the Greeks, Alexander was flirting with the practice of proskynesis. This was the traditional greeting to a Persian king. If you were a commoner, it meant fully prostrating yourself on the ground, and if you were of a more elevated background, it meant bowing. This was viewed as worshipful to his Greek and Macedonian men, and mocked by them. Alexander doesn‚Äôt fully make them observe proskynesis, but he does sort of skirt around it by setting up a shrine of Zeus next to him and making his Greek subjects worship when they come to visit him. You can imagine how that would go over. Basically he‚Äôs saying, I‚Äôm not Jesus, but I‚Äôm going to set up a picture of Jesus behind me and every time you come to speak to me you have to say ‚ÄúThank you for blessing me this day, Jesus.‚Äù and I‚Äôm going to say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre welcome.‚Äù But to be clear, I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm Jesus.

And then Alexander is getting mad at them because they ‚Äô re mocking and putting down some of his most important Alexander the Great (Part 2): subjects, some of his newly gained nobles and advisors from Persia. In one incident, Callisthenes, a close friend of Alexander and his official biographer, won‚Äôt let the thing go. He‚Äôs openly mocking Alexander and his Persian subjects who bow to him. And so when a group of pages conspire to kill Alexander, Callisthenes is also arrested for having inspired them, and he is either executed or dies of natural causes while imprisoned, depending on the source. Well all of this is creating a pressure cooker environment where Alexander‚Äôs Greek and Macedonian subjects are feeling very disgruntled. One young aristocrat hears of a plot to kill Alexander and tells Philotas, the son of Parmenion. When nothing happens, he goes back and tells Philotas a second time. Finally, the young man takes a different route and makes sure that Alexander finds out by other means about the plot. The conspirators are summarily executed. And now the question arises what Alexander should do with Philotas. As a son of Parmenion, he had served in important roles in all of Alexander‚Äôs major battles, and he was a strong leader, a capable military commander who had done much to help Alexander win his victories. But did his failure to notify Alexander of the plot mean that he hoped the plot would succeed? Philotas claimed that he simply didn‚Äôt take the threat seriously. That these were the imaginings of a young man and didn‚Äôt constitute a real threat. But egged on by nobles who were jealous of Philotas‚Äôs lofty position, Alexander had Philotas tortured until he extracted a forced - and almost certainly false - confession. He was then executed, either by stoning or being stabbed with spears. Alexander then sent swift riders to assassinate Parmenion before he could learn of his son‚Äôs execution. It is an ignominious and ungrateful end for a man who had served Alexander and Philip well for decades, and who had contributed much to both of their successes. Perhaps Philotas was negligent in his reporting of the conspiracy. But it‚Äôs easy to see a much simpler motive. With dissatisfaction roiling all around him, Alexander did indeed need to worry about conspiracy. And while Parmenion and his son were almost certainly not conspiring at this time, they were the only two Macedonians with enough prestige and stature to replace him. By having them removed, Alexander truly removed any possible threat to his rule. We really just don‚Äôt know what the motives are.

Some historians are inclined to see it as a conspiracy by other nobles to have Parmenion and his son removed . Also around this time , Alexander the Great (Part 2): there‚Äôs another troubling incident involving Alexander. He‚Äôs at a party, he‚Äôs had a few drinks, which is a situation that seems to frequently get Alexander in trouble, and he gets into an argument with a friend named Black Cleitus. Black Cleitus is the one who saved Alexander‚Äôs life at the Battle of the Granicus. He was a good friend and a close companion. But they were both drunk and they started quarreling, with Cleitus saying that Alexander was forgetting where he came from and that he owed all of his victories to his father, Philip. Alexander gets mad and ends up throwing a javelin through Black Cleitus‚Äôs heart, killing him. By all indications, this was not intentional. Alexander was immediately horrified by what he had done, and refused to eat for three days afterwards in mourning. But I think it‚Äôs just another sign of the pressure that Alexander was under. Fusing the two ends of his empire was going to prove as difficult as winning any battle. Alexander‚Äôs early attempts to combine Greek and Persian customs were ultimately clumsy and mostly unsuccessful. India After a year or so of this, Alexander decides that his conquest of Persia is not actually finished. Darius I, the founder of the Persian empire and the Achaemenid dynasty, had conquered the western part of India - the Indus river valley - more than 200 year previously. Since then, the Persian kings had not really ruled it, they hadn‚Äôt exercised any control over any part of India, and had not really tried to. But they nominally asserted that they were the rulers of this territory. And when Alexander takes the throne, Indian exiles start coming to his court to see. These are men who just like in Greece or Persia, had lost civil wars or struggles for power, and were now seeking allies to put them back on the throne. And Alexander did not want to see anything undone. He wanted to make sure that the entire Persian empire was under his control, even those parts that hadn‚Äôt previously complied with the Persians. And Alexander was more than happy to oblige. But let‚Äôs be honest, I don‚Äôt think that any of this gets at the real reason why Alexander invaded India. Here‚Äôs how I think about it: Running the Persian empire doesn‚Äôt sound fun, to me. You are constantly meeting with delegations from various regions who are complaining about your policies or appealing for some change or another. You‚Äôre constantly worrying about back-stabbing and court plots.

You ‚Äô re constantly worrying about back - stabbing and court plots . You ‚Äô re mostly sitting Alexander the Great (Part 2): in the same throne in the same court as you take meetings and hear petitions day after day after day. Contrast that with what life was like when Alexander was on campaign. You‚Äôre basically camping in a new cool place every single day. And not just camping, but glamping because you have this huge nice tent that is well heated and you‚Äôve got good food being brought to you. And speaking of food, Alexander was a light eater, of course, but he really enjoyed trying different kinds of meats and especially different kinds of fish that he was able to find and enjoy as he went on these various conquests to all these new areas. This is before refrigeration so you couldn‚Äôt just sample the food from all over the empire. So you‚Äôre in nature in your nice tent, you get food that‚Äôs delicious and new and exciting, you‚Äôre hanging out with your top commanders all day, who also happen to be your best friends. And oh yeah, anytime you have a decent-sized victory you throw a festival where the best athletes in the world come to compete in games, the best actors come to put on plays, the best musicians come to play, and you get to drink and party and enjoy all of this. And if you enjoy sight-seeing today, oh man. The globalized world that we lived in is actually extremely homogeneous compared to Alexander‚Äôs day. Each new city brought new languages, new customs and manners, new gods, new histories and stories, new temples and architecture. So look, it‚Äôs clear that Alexander was addicted to being on campaign, to being at war - but it wasn‚Äôt just because he liked gaining more power, it was also because I think the act of being on campaign must have been very fun. So he goes to India. He fights a number of battles, the biggest and most famous of which is the Battle of the Hydaspes River. Once again Alexander is fighting against overwhelming odds, attacking over a river, and this time he is facing a large contingent of great war elephants. You can only imagine the shock that his soldiers must have felt facing such giant beasts. Supposedly there was very hard fighting at the river, but eventually Alexander is able to encircle the army of his opponent, an Indian king named Porus, and force him to surrender.

And Alexander actually befriended him after the battle and allowed him to keep Alexander the Great (Part 2): his kingdom, so long as he promised to submit to Alexander in the future. Return Voyage Now according to some sources, Alexander expected that he would soon reach the edge of the world. Not that he believed the world was flat but the classical Greeks believed that the whole world was basically one big landmass and that it was surrounded by one great ocean. And Alexander thought he was close to that ocean. And so when Porus tells him, that actually no, there are more even greater Indian kingdoms as you travel east, Alexander says ‚Äúokay let‚Äôs go fight and conquer them.‚Äù But supposedly his men mutiny. They hear that this Indian kingdom, now known as the Nanda empire, was massive with a huge army, thousands of war elephants, and hundreds of thousands of men. And at this point the longest serving of the veterans have been on campaign for TEN YEARS since they left Macedonia. And so they say we‚Äôre not going. Alexander says fine all you ingrates who don‚Äôt want gold and glory can go back but I‚Äôm going to press on with those who will follow me. But after a few days it becomes clear that basically no one will follow him. Alexander sulks for a bit. Upset that he can‚Äôt go on, but he eventually agrees to turn around. And so his conquests end in Western India. He sends much of his army back to Persia with his general Craterus, but he leads the rest of them down the Indus river on barges and boats that they build or otherwise acquire, and then leads them home through the desert, along the coast of modern day Pakistan and Iran. This is one of the most controversial decisions of Alexander‚Äôs career. Because it‚Äôs extremely dangerous, it‚Äôs basically unknown, unexplored territory, and it benefits him nothing. There are no kingdoms or even cities on this coast that he can conquer. But according to Arrian, he did it to outshine other conquerors, none of whom had explored this territory. Well unfortunately for him, they never explored it for a reason. And that is that it‚Äôs extremely dry and barren territory. There was very little food or water for his men and his army suffered crushing casualties in this desert crossing. Many of them died of thirst or diseases brought on by malnutrition.

The End When Alexander comes Alexander the Great (Part 2): back, he has to purge a number of officers who had got up to nonsense while he was gone, some were cruel to local populations and others had dabbled in corruption, so he sets about reforming his government. He‚Äôs also still trying to marry the Greek and Persian halves of his empire, so he does something very curious. He goes and gets Persian wives for his nobility and has them all married in a mass wedding for hundreds of people. He himself takes two Persian wives, the daughters of the two most recent Persian kings. These marriages largely did not work out and most of the Macedonians just left their Persian wives behind and headed back to Macedonia, but it showed that he was still trying to marry the two cultures to create a single cohesive political unit, in this case by literally marrying the two populations. Once again, this fusion is making people uncomfortable. At one point, he decommissions his older and wounded veterans, and this really throws the Macedonian soldiers into a fit. They‚Äôre worried that Alexander is trying to replace them with Persian soldiers. They‚Äôre thinking ‚ÄúWe just conquered this whole empire for you with our sweat and blood, and now you‚Äôre turning around and handing it on a silver platter to the people who we conquered.‚Äù ‚ÄúI will speak not to quell your longing for home, Macedonians, for you may go wherever you wish as far as I am concerned, but so you may realize, as you depart, who we are, you and I, that you should act toward me in this way.

He gave you cloaks to wear instead of skins, led you down from the mountains to the plains, and made you able to hold your own in battle against your barbarian neighbors, so your safety depended not on your mountain strongholds but on your own courage.‚Äù On and on he goes, recounting how he has risked everything, made his men rich, taken nothing for himself, given them glory and honor and comfortable homes to go back to.

There is a big reconciliation with his men , and he has a big banquet with his Macedonian men and his new Persian soldiers to try to build a Alexander the Great (Part 2): spirit of harmony between the two. Alexander administers his empire for a year or so, conquering some mountain tribes, and settling some disputes, before moving his court to Babylon. At Babylon, Alexander makes plans for his next big invasion: He plans to invade Arabia. But one night, Alexander is out partying when he comes down with a fever. He continues to make plans for his invasion, believing that he will soon recover, but his condition only continues to get worse. His fever gets worse and he weakens until he could barely even speak. Many have speculated that Alexander was poisoned, but the duration of the sickness and the slowly worsening symptoms seem to point to an illness, perhaps malaria. As his condition worsens, people start to worry about who might take over the empire if he should die. At this point Alexander did have an infant son, who could be expected to reign eventually, but someone would need to administer the empire in the meantime. As it became clear that Alexander would not recover, his top generals and friends crowded around his bed and asked him to whom the crown should go. With the little energy that remained in him, with his last words, Alexander whispered ‚Äúto the strongest.‚Äù Epilogue You can imagine how those men must have felt standing around Alexander‚Äôs bed as they realized that they were all now at war with each other. I‚Äôll get more into what did eventually happen to his empire in the endnotes episode. But, I‚Äôll leave that as the end of the narrative portion of the story. So what are we to make of the second half of Alexander‚Äôs life? What lessons can be learned? First of all, from the siege of Tyre we learned that sometimes there is no clever solution. Sometimes even the greatest commanders just have to grind out victories with long, arduous effort. From his battle at Gaugamela we learned the power of the pivotal moment. Of keeping your best strategy, your best effort, in your back pocket until your enemy is worn down and then overwhelming them and breaking their spirit. From his pursuit of Darius we learned to never leave a thing mostly done. Never take your victory lap until the thing is 100% finished and no opposition stands in your way. We can also learn to, and I mean this unironically, follow your passion.

Alexander never lost a battle. He built an empire more powerful than any that had ever existed. He was absolutely restless and insatiable in his desire to see more, experience more, do more. He was the original man to receive the ‚Äúgreat‚Äù monicker. He served as the inspiration for Pompey, Caesar, Hannibal, Napoleon, and others. I think that, when another man worthy to be called great is born into the world, he will take inspiration from Alexander. He has been dead for 2300 years, but somehow he is still alive in the hearts of those who revere his life. When Octavian, better known as Caesar Augustus, was in Alexandria, he asked to see the tomb of Alexander the Great. He stayed in the tomb for a long while, contemplating Alexander‚Äôs long shadow and his incredible legacy.

So if that was today I think 3 percent of GDP would be something like 700 billion or something. So it's basically, Elon Musk plus Jeff Bezos plus Bernard Arnault plus Mark Zuckerberg is is what you have to be thinking about when you think about John D Rockefeller. It's not just that is the imprint that he left on the world. He basically invented modern business as it's conducted. He invented the modern corporation, how it functions, how it works. He in his philanthropic efforts which are not as widely known as some others. Those have had maybe a bigger impact than any. He He. One of the things that he was, one of his big legacies that people don't know about is he invented the American medical system. Again, we'll get into more of that, but this is someone who leveraged, he founded the University of Chicago, which is, one of America's great universities now. Again, this is not something that many people know. It's an episode not only about how he made just unbelievable amounts of money, it's also an episode about how he used that money to have, influence and impact on the world. And it's also about a really interesting character. And one of the most effective and unique executives I've ever heard of. One biographer called him.

{"text": ", influence and impact on the world . And it ' s also about a really interesting character . And one of the most effective and unique executives I ' ve ever heard of . One biographer called him . One biographer said , called him quote , the greatest Rockefeller: business administrator America has ever produced. An oil historian echoes this verdict quote, Rockefeller was the single most important figure in shaping the oil industry. The same might arguably be said for his place in the history of America's industrial development and the rise of the modern corporation. So if you want to learn to lead, if you want to learn to be a great executive. So if you want to learn to be a great executive or a great leader in any capacity, I think his story is worth studying because he leads in a really interesting way. It's different from a lot of people I've heard. So, let's get into it. I will share my sources, which are, I read the I read the excellent and extremely long biography Titan by Ron Chernow, and then I also read John D. Rockefeller's autobiography called Random Reminiscences of Men and Events. It's not really an autobiography, it is what it says. It's some autobiographical musings. But yeah. I think it's a really interesting episode. I learned a ton and there's a ton of great takeaways. This one's going to be a little bit different. I'm going to go through most of his life in this one. And then I'll just have the rump in with the end notes episode coming soon. Hope you enjoy it. Thanks for listening. With that, please enjoy the life of John D. Rockefeller. The father of John Rockefeller was named William Rockefeller Sr., and he was a wild figure. He would be known in his life as Devil Bill. He was extremely handsome and charismatic and talented. He could tame animals. He was a crack shot who could who was never bested in a shooting competition. He loved telling jokes. He loved telling stories. He was also a fraud who went around selling snake oil. He was a quack doctor who claimed that he could he was at times either a true charlatan claiming to be deaf and dumb or a quack doctor who sold essentially snake oil. There's actually. His sign read, quote, Dr. William a Rockefeller, the celebrated cancer specialist here for one day only all cases of cancer cured unless too far gone and then can be greatly benefited.

{"text": ". Okay , that gives you . An idea of what kind of doctor this , what kind of businessman this guy was . He claimed to be a doctor , but had no formal medical training . He also would go around and beg for money and take odd Rockefeller: jobs. And he would do this act where he pretended to be deaf and dumb. And one day, he is in a city. Pretending to be deaf and dumb. And this girl from a wealthy family, her name's Eliza Davison, takes notice of him again. He's tall, built, very handsome. And she says, if that guy weren't deaf and dumb, I'd consider marrying him and devil Bill Rockefeller says. Wouldn't you know it, I am cured! And And apparently it was so charming the fact that she came to know him as a deaf and dumb beggar and and then and then he realizes that he is not in fact deaf and dumb does not scare her off. They do get married. Again, she was from a wealthy family, very Puritan, very religious. Very well to do, very educated. The opposite of him. They get married, and Devil Bill says, uh, I would like to bring in this housekeeper as well, our name is Nancy Brown and she's going to live with us. And then Nancy Brown, who's unmarried, starts ending up pregnant. And so Devil Bill has two families living under one house. Eventually Nancy, gets kicked to the curb, but Bill was a free spirit who loved the open road. And so he would go on these big, business trips for months at a time. He would just disappear from the family. And he would often be selling his his herbal concoctions, his snake oil. And then he would come back flush with cash and would flaunt all this money that he had made. In the meantime His wife and children would have to survive on credit from the local store from the local general goods store. And and so John D. Rockefeller grew up learning to account for every penny, and that would be important in his life, that he was someone who always took a very close account of things. Devil Bill would come back Big Bill Rockefeller would come back and would spoil his children and would, Spend his money and pay off all the debts. I should say that some of his business ventures were legitimate, especially in the lumber business. He would go off and he was doing low lumber and those were quite lucrative. Or he was off, selling snake oil, but he had, the big bill had this mania for money. He loved money. He took it out lovingly. He liked to show it off. He liked to hold it. One of his companions said,", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/rockefeller", "title": "Rockefeller", "chunk_index": 3, "publication_date": "2024-02-24", "total_chunks_in_doc": 37}}
{"text": "he was off , selling snake oil , but he had , the big bill had this mania for money . He loved money . He took it out lovingly . He liked to show it off . He liked to hold it . One of his companions said , Rockefeller: quote, the old man had a passion for money that amounted almost to a craze. I never met a man who had such a love of money. And, he was this interesting he was this interesting presence he would come into their lives intermittently and. Bring really bring a lot of energy and and celebration and happiness and to the family. But then he also, he was never abusive or anything like that, but he was definitely a quirky father. Like there's one story where when John was a child, Bill would tell him to leap from his chair. Into his arms and then he would spin him around and then one time John Jumps and Bill doesn't catch him and he crashes to the floor and Bill says to him quote remember Never trust anyone completely not even me So he tries to teach him all these hard lessons when he is around the family starts off living in The family starts off living in upstate, New York in a city called Richford in a town called Richford And apparently to get away from some trouble that Big Bill had caused, the family moved to Moravia, New York, and then to Owego, both in upstate New York. And these are pretty small towns. They're moving to Slightly bigger towns. And It gives you an idea of what a provincial upbringing he had that John tells a story that when he moved to a, we go, he says, quote, down at the railroad station one day, I saw a Frenchman think of that a real live Frenchman, and he wore a mustache. The first I ever saw. So that gives you an idea of this small town upbringing, that to see a foreigner, a Frenchman, a real live Frenchman, was a big deal for him. His mother was the opposite of Big Bill in many ways. She was a very religious, very devout Baptist, very committed. And John grew up going to church and that was extremely important to him. Yeah, it was the kind of religious family. Where, here's a quote from Chernow's book, he said, quote, Inspired by a Sunday school class on forgiveness, the children initiated a custom that suggests how religion permeated their lives. Each night, when they got into bed, they turned to their siblings and said, Do you forgive me all that I have done to you today? By the time they fell asleep, the air had been cleared of all recriminations or festering anger. They're very religious.

{"text": "Do you forgive me all that I have done to you today ? By the time they fell asleep , the air had been cleared of all recriminations or festering anger . They ' re very religious . And he gets this religiosity from his mother and this love of Rockefeller: money. From his father. And he actually did not see them as contradictory. He saw them as going hand in hand, that money could be a sign of God's divine favor in that with that money, he could improve the world. He could contribute it to Baptist churches. He could give it away as charity. He could do good things. And so those are the twin pillars of his whole life. He wants to make money and he wants to give it away. And he learns early on all about money. First a local farmer first, and the, one of the early lessons he has on money is he's working for a local farmer and he's helping him dig potatoes for 37 and a half cents per day. This sent up an instructive contrast for him when soon afterwards, he loaned one farmer 50 at 7 percent interest and collected 3 and 50 cents at the year's end. Without without a stitch of work end quote. Says, quote, the impression was gaining ground with me that it was a good thing to let the money be my slave and not make myself a slave to money. That's what he said, had to say about that experience. And again, John is different from his father in that he's more reserved. He's a much more of a rural follower and and he's much more religious, he's not this crazy philanderer, but. He does have this obsession with money, just like his father. One day he's walking in with a friend and he blurts out someday, sometime when I'm a man, I want to be worth a hundred thousand dollars. I'm going to be too someday. And he blurts his house to this one friend, but according to sure. Now, there are many such accounts. That, almost identical from other people. So this is something he's really fixated on. Is, making all this money, becoming worth 100, 000. Nevertheless, he's not an exceptional student. One quote about his early childhood. Quote, I have no recollection of John excelling at anything. I do remember he worked hard at everything. Not talking much and studying with great industry. There was nothing about him to make anybody pay a special attention to him or speculate about his future. He's not brilliant. He's good at math. He's good at arithmetic. That's the one place where he kind of excels and he has this incredible self", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/rockefeller", "title": "Rockefeller", "chunk_index": 5, "publication_date": "2024-02-24", "total_chunks_in_doc": 37}}
{"text": "anybody pay a special attention to him or speculate about his future . He ' s not brilliant . He ' s good at math . He ' s good at arithmetic . That ' s the one place where he kind of excels and he has this incredible self Rockefeller: discipline. So Chernow is talking about one contemporary who is in the village named Susan Lamont. He says, quote, Susan Lamont saw that the boy's eerie self discipline concealed a deep fund of emotion, and she remembered the ceremony of grief he went through. On the day she died, John came to our house and stretched out on the ground and would not go away. He was so sorry that he would not, he was so sorry that he would not go away, but lay there all day. Such stories reveal a sensitivity in Rockefeller that would always be there, but that would later be studiously concealed behind the polished facade of the hard driving businessman. And I think this is true of many great leaders, great achievers. They have this really deep well of emotion. They're very emotional people, but they're able to control and channel that emotion. And that was true of Rockefeller. He really mastered his emotions. And was very serious. His future sister in law, Lucy Spellman, said, quote, He was a studious boy, grave, reserved, never noisy or given to boisterous play. One high school teacher described him with patent distaste as, quote, The coldest blooded, the quietest and most deliberate chap. As I said, his father moves the family around a little bit in order to facilitate his His vagabond, his vagabonding, and eventually he moves the family he, he finds he falls in love completely in love with a new woman. And and because of that has to move the family again. And so he moves the family to Strongsville, Ohio, just outside of Cleveland. And in fact, on June 12th, 1855, big bill married Margaret Allen in Nichols, New York, just south of Owego. So he tried to. It wasn't good to have his two families right nearby, right? Which is why he moves the John Rockefeller and the rest of his family to Ohio to keep them separate. But for the rest of his life Bill Rockefeller would be married to two women and keep a secret family. John was smart enough that they the plan was to send him to college and go study and get a degree, start going places in the world. But it's, he's 15 years old when his father, starts the second family. So all of a sudden Bill Rockefeller has to support two families. So he's a little short on money. So he says, John. Without saying the reason why, hey, I can't afford to", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/rockefeller", "title": "Rockefeller", "chunk_index": 6, "publication_date": "2024-02-24", "total_chunks_in_doc": 37}}
{"text": "father , starts the second family . So all of a sudden Bill Rockefeller has to support two families . So he ' s a little short on money . So he says , John . Without saying the reason why , hey , I can ' t afford to Rockefeller: send you to college anymore. So why don't you go, just study business. And so John paid 40 for a three month course at Folsom's Commercial College, which is a chain of colleges that offer these, these little business courses. It's like the University of Phoenix at its time. Like it's reputable for what it is which is like a vocational school but has no prestige. He enters when he's 15, by the time he finishes in the summer of 1855, he had just turned 16 years old and, is ready to leave this insane family situation. And is ready to be done with dependence on his father. And so he wants Respectability, they're a backcountry family and his father is very not respectable. He's always carrying out these wild schemes in lumber and you know in hucksterism and so he says quote I went to the railroads, to the banks and to the wholesale merchants. I did not go to any small establishments. I did not guess what it would be, but I was after something big. Okay. And so he goes in Cleveland and he's talking with all these big firms, you know, wholesale banks, railroads, and he's going through and he's pitching himself and he says you know, he made, and he made it his job. to find a job. He wrote, quote, I was working every day at my business, the business of looking for work. I put in my full time at this every day. And so he goes around to all these businesses and pitches himself as an accountant and as a minor businessman. And they all say, it was not a good time economically. And they all say, no. And so he makes it all the way through his list. So what does he do after that? You want a job, You literally go ask every major establishment in the city for a list and they all say no, okay, you're supposed to try a lot, supposed to put a lot out there and they all say no, what does he do? He simply starts over from the top of the list and visit some of them two or three times. He just keeps going. And this is one thing Steve Jobs talks about putting your dent in the universe, right? When he's talking to. When he's talking to John Scully, he says, Do you want to keep selling sugar water, or do you want to put a dent in the", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/rockefeller", "title": "Rockefeller", "chunk_index": 7, "publication_date": "2024-02-24", "total_chunks_in_doc": 37}}

When he ' s talking to John Scully , he says , Do you want to keep selling sugar water , or do you want to put a dent in the Rockefeller: universe? And this is the thing I talk about, is remember, The universe does not want to be dented. That's what it means to dent the universe. It's a sort of intrusive act. And if you want to dent the universe, You have to have a greater will than the universe. The universe has a lot of inertia, but it doesn't care that much. And, And so sometimes I think people take failure as a sign to change their strategy. And sometimes that's definitely necessary, but sometimes it's hard to know which, when do you need to change your strategy? But sometimes you need to consider maybe I just need to do a Rockefeller. Okay. I failed. Have I first tried just like doing saying, no, I will not fail and going through two or three times, just like really making sure that this isn't happening for me. I think it's interesting. So he's going through the lists again. And then on September 26th, 1855, he walks into the offices of Hewitt and Tuttle. And these are merchants and shippers. These are people who are handling a lot of dry goods, a lot of food, and they're buying and selling. salt, pork, beans, and they listened to him. And here's what Rockefeller said, quote, all my future seemed to hinge on that day. And I often tremble when I ask myself the question, what if I had not got the job in a but after interviewing with. Tuttle in the morning, he interviews with Hewitt in the morning, or in the afternoon, and he is, in fact, offered a job. And for the rest of his life, he would honor September 26th as Job Day. And he actually celebrated it more than his birthday. He was obsessed with Job Day, which I think tells you Which I think tells you a lot about who he was, once again. And I think this is one of the things that defined Rockefeller was the clarity of his vision. Again, I've said this before, but knowing what you want is a superpower. Knowing what you want is a superpower. So few people can just have a clear vision around what they want and work for it and block out everything else. Not Rockefeller. He was greatness. He knew exactly what he wanted. One of the things I always bring up is that every great leader is following another great leader.

One of the things I always bring up is that every great leader is following another great leader . It ' s just following in the path of Rockefeller: someone else. And this is true of Rockefeller as well. He finds this book. called Extracts from the Diary and Correspondence of the Late Amos Lawrence. And so Amos Lawrence is a great American businessman, manufactures textiles up in New England, and he gave away more than 100, 000 in his life. And he does it in a very sort of planned and thoughtful way. And so Rockefeller says, quote, I remember how fascinated I was with his letters. I made up my mind that if I could manage it someday, I would give away money too. So that's what his whole life has been around, making money. and giving it away. And he sees his job as the first step. And so this job is hopefully just the first step on that ladder. And it would be, because he soon proved himself to be perhaps the greatest junior account perhaps the greatest junior accountant of all time. He said, quote, As I began my life as a bookkeeper, I learned to have great respect for figures and facts, no matter how small they were. I had a passion. And he was, indeed, extremely passionate about detail. Listen to this story. He says, quote, I examined all the invoices, bills of landing and other documents and found this captain had presented entirely unwarranted claims. He never did it again. And so this is what he's doing. He is writing letters, keeping books and paying bills. And as he's keeping these books and paying these bills, he's really scrutinizing the books. And he's finding any savings that he can. And he's famous for, if he's being overcharged by cents by even just, a couple of cents, he's going to bring it up and make sure that the price gets adjusted. He was also extremely effective as a collections agent for for the company. They had a number of rental properties and so he would go collect. And, Rockefeller is a church boy, so he's very, so he's very polite. He's scrupulously polite, but he has this unbelievable persistence and it would take people by surprise. And if at first they wouldn't give up the money, he would just sit outside in his buggy and just patient as could be and wait until the debtor capitulated and, and gave up the money.

In fact, he makes it, he makes certain to never show emotion, but he's just going to keep coming until He's just the Terminator. He's just going to keep coming. He's just. Emotionless clear eyed, logical, and he is just going to persist until he gets exactly what he wants. That is how John D. Rockefeller was. Again, like the tide, you know, you can shout, you can scream, you can try to build walls, but guess what? The tide is coming in. The one time that he breaks This, Terminator like character is when when he lands, is whenever he lands a deal. If he lands a deal or makes a great trade, And make some money, then he'll do a little dance. He'll do a little skip and he'll get excited. In fact, one older businessman remembers catching him one day saying quote, I am bound to be rich, bound to be rich, bound to be rich. So that's like the one thing that get him excited in life was making money. But again, he had these, this twin passion making money, but not just making it, but giving it away. And this was not someone who waited until he was rich to give away money in his first year. He's making hardly any money and he really needed it. He's poor and the records show that he donated about 6 percent of his wages to charity, which is pretty good. For how poor he was. He said, quote, I have my earliest ledger. And when I was only making a dollar a day, I was giving five, 10 or 25 cents to all of these objects. And not only is he donating his money, but he's donating his time. He is very involved with his local Baptist church. Not just attending services, but, performing unpaid labor as well. He became a Sunday school teacher, a trustee, an unpaid clerk who kept the board minutes in his own hand. And even sometimes was a volunteer janitor who could be seen sweeping up the the chapel.

His ability to acquire money and his religiosity and his commitment to God and to giving it away . He said , quote , God gave me my Rockefeller: money. Hi. Okay. Yes. Five minutes. Okay. Bye. He also said, quote, I remember clearly when the financial plan, if I may call it so of my life was formed. It was out in Ohio under the administration of a dear old minister who preached quote, get money, get it honestly, and then give it wisely. I wrote that down in a little book. That's one thing that Rockefeller was famous for. He had this little red book where he wrote down every single little expense. And and would also write down, stuff like this. He kept it as a little journal too. When Tuttle quit the practice. So remember there's there's two partners, Hewitt and Tuttle. Tuttle quits in January of 1857. And so he's given Tuttle's job. So at age 17, he. It's essentially a partner in his firm, but where, but he's not actually made partner. So whereas Tuttle had made 2, 000 a year, Rockefeller was given only 500 a year. The next year it's raised only to 600 by 1858. He thinks he's being way underpaid. He is being way underpaid. Nevertheless, this guy's 17 years old. And so he continues to chug along with Tuttle or with Hewitt and look, Everyone who achieves great things has to have A time in their life when they create way more value than they capture. And that is true. Immediately springs to mind as Walt Disney who especially did not capture a lot of the upside on Oswald, the lucky rabbit and on a lot of his early cartoons, but you have to do this if you wait to cap until you can capture all the value to do your best work then you're never gonna break through. So you have to go through that time period where you create way more value than you capture. And here Rockefeller is certainly doing that, There is a danger in letting this go on too long. So he only does it for about a year. And then in April of 1858 he goes out and, he's making the rounds, he's becoming well known. And he borrows some money and is able to start a new partnership with, he's able to leave Isaac Hewitt and start a new partnership, Clark and Rockefeller. And so at 18 years old, he is a partner.

And this again , like you have to imagine this is not like finance and Rockefeller: the way of thinking that we think of it. It's not trading, just like numbers on a page. They're literally warehousing this stuff, he's literally counting beans. There's a story where they get a big batch of beans that are like semi spoiled. They have some bad ones and they've got dirt and garbage in them. And he says that quote, when we were not needed in the office, we used to go out to the warehouse, my partner and I, and sort out those beans. Um, this is someone who, again, is very attentive. To details as a, not above counting beans and sorting beans in order to get the maximum profit from them. Rockefeller succeeds in this new business. He's really good at raising capital. Part of that is he's a good salesman. He's not like larger than life and this big personality like his father, but what he is extremely reliable, extremely honest. And gives off this kind of aw shucks persona. He's a church going boy. And so he gets a lot of business frankly from religious people who who want to give their business, their money to a good Christian boy. Here's what Rockefeller had to say about it. Quote, I found the old men had confidence in me right away. And after I stayed a few weeks in the country, I returned home and the consignments came in and our business was increased and it opened up a new world for me. And. It's during this time that the civil war breaks out and he doesn't go he doesn't fight in the civil war. He hires a substitute, which is something that you could do. He said about it, quote, I wanted to go in the army and do my part. But it was simply out of the question. We were in a new business, and if I had not stayed, it must have stopped, and was so many dependent on it. And what he's referencing there is he still lives at home, so his mother and his siblings are still dependent on him to bring in the bacon, to bring in the money. And so he has a lot of people dependent on him, so he does not go into the Civil War, but he does make a lot of money in the Civil War. A lot of people did.

It drives up commodity prices . And so Rockefeller: a lot of people got rich on trading commodities. And one thing that I think is interesting. Is that Rockefeller's office becomes a center. Here's what it says, quote, Since Rockefeller's commodity business depended upon market intelligence and a rapid flow of telegrams from various sections of the country, his office became a clubhouse for the latest battlefield bulletins. He and Maurice Clark tacked up two large detailed maps and tracked the war's progress with rapid attention. Yeah, coming. If you find the, if, as long as I get my way quote, it goes here. Okay. So civil war is an enormously profitable time. They didn't get any government contracts necessarily, but the enormous inflation in commodity prices and the general business surge did benefit them greatly. Okay. So it is during the civil war in 1862. That this guy, Samuel Andrews, walks into their office and says, Hey, I have an idea for a for an oil refinery. He had developed something called fractional distillation, which is supposed to be much more effective in extracting kerosene. So he comes in to their office and he's actually friends with he's actually friends with Clark. So he goes and he asks Clark and Clark says, quote, I told him there was no chance that John and I together did not have more than 250 we could spare out of our business. We simply had enough working capital together with our credit at the banks to enable us to make advances to consigners. paying insurance and rent. So Andrews is shoot. But he goes into Rockefeller's office and gives the sales pitch to Rockefeller. But Rockefeller is a penny pincher. He's been saving like crazy. So he's got some money. And so he's encouraged by Rockefeller. He goes back to Clark. Who says, quote, I started to shut him off, but when he said, Mr. Rockefeller thinks well of it, I impulsively replied if John will go in, I will. So they pledged 4, 000 for half the working capital of the new refining venture. And this is a huge investment for them. 4, 000. Okay. This is far from the only refinery. There were 20 refineries in Cleveland at the time. And at the time, it's doing really well.

The Civil War had disrupted whaling which was used to make candles And so other energy sources were getting really expensive and kerosene was much cheaper by contrast . And when we talk about the oil rush now , it Rockefeller: has nothing to do with gasoline. No one has much of a use for gasoline at this point. It's all kerosene, which is burned in little lamps as a light source. But kerosene starts doing great. And in the early days, everyone is making Money hands over fist in the oil business. And so Rockefeller goes hard and he's involved in the details once again. Yo, he goes in early. He's rolling barrels, he's stacking hoops, he's sweeping out shavings And one of the things Rockefeller is really good at is finding savings. And one of the ways he does this is he finds that, um, let's do that later. Quote, such was Rockefeller's ingenuity, his ceaseless search for even minor improvements that within a year of finding had overtaken produce as the most profitable side of the business. Despite the unceasing vicissitudes of the oil industry, prone to cataclysmic boons and busts, he would never experience a single year of loss. Keep in mind at this time, oil has only been discovered. In Northwestern Pennsylvania. So that's not far from Cleveland at all. And as far as anyone knows, it's the only source of oil in the world. And the industry is so new that one big new well, one discovery, one oil field could lead to the supply of oil doubling. So you have these huge oscillations in price. Okay. So like a barrel of oil going for cents, and then going for 12 it literally does in 1861, the price goes between 10 cents and 10. And in 1864, it fluctuates between 4 and 12. So you needed to have a strong stomach. If you're going to be in the oil business, drilling for oil was. Like a lottery, and it attracted a lot of rough neck types who wanted to try their hand and see if they might strike it rich refining on the other hand was a little more buttoned up quote before too long. He realized that refining was the critical point where he could exert maximum leverage over the industry. And so they quickly run into a problem, which is. Rockefeller really loves oil. He's wow, this is a great business. It is really profitable. This is, he quickly realizes he's found his calling in life. Maurice Clark said John had a biting faith in two things, the Baptist creed and oil. That's correct. On the other hand, Maurice Clark is just cautious. So here's what Rockefeller had", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/rockefeller", "title": "Rockefeller", "chunk_index": 14, "publication_date": "2024-02-24", "total_chunks_in_doc": 37}}
{"text": "he ' s found his calling in life . Maurice Clark said John had a biting faith in two things , the Baptist creed and oil . That ' s correct . On the other hand , Maurice Clark is just cautious . So here ' s what Rockefeller had Rockefeller: to say about him. This is a great quote, quote, Clark was very angry when I borrowed money to extend our business for refining oil of refining oil. Why you have borrowed 100, 000. He exclaimed as if that was some sort of offense and they were borrowing a ton, but the quote was on Clark was an old grandmother and was scared to death because we owed money at the banks. It's a great quote. Clark was an old grandmother and was scared because we owed money at the banks. And on, by contrast, Rockefeller quickly realizes that scale is the key to this business. So he says, quote, we should borrow whenever we can safely extend the business by doing so. And so he wants to keep borrowing and he wants to keep expanding. Clark does not. And then finally it comes to an embass and they say, all right, this is not going to work. So let's so let's go to an auction and we can bid for the other half of the company, the other 50 percent and one of us will get out. And so they're bidding against each other. It quickly advances to 60, 000 and slowly to 70, 000. But Rockefeller has lined up a bunch of banks, a lot of outside financing before bidding war and he's going to do whatever it takes, like he really believes in oil. He's not going to give up on the business that he that he started in the oil business. He ends up buying it for 72, 000. So at age 25, he owns Cleveland's largest refinery, which could treat 500 barrels of crude oil a day, twice the capacity of its nearest local rival. And it was one of the largest facilities in the world. I don't know if I mentioned that Rockefeller also is very good at using up all of the oil. So most of them would take the kerosene and then dump the rest. But he would turn the rest of the oil into gasoline to fuel the refinery, and then sell the rest as lubricating oil, petroleum jelly, paraffin wax, whatever they could make from it. Coatings and paints, things like that. In 1864, he marries Laura Celestia Spellman, who would go by Setti, and she was a good companion for him, for his entire life. Especially early on, she was a more business minded woman than most, and she would actually review the books with him, to help him look it over.

Just like Napoleon , he Rockefeller: worked the morning of his wedding. He makes his own barrels, John Rock, John D. Rockefeller makes his own barrels. He realizes this is one of our, one of our main expenses and, are these people really giving us a great price? So they were buying them for 2 and 50 cents. And he figures out a process for making their own oil barrels. And soon they're making them for less than a dollar per barrel. So that's a huge saving benzene. That's another thing they're selling. So he's always trying to expand. He needs more and more credit. Like you said, I want to borrow all the time to expand credit. And so he's quickly outstripping Cleveland's ability to finance his operation. So he starts migrating towards New York where there are bigger banks and he can raise more money. He's a really good borrower. He can get on really good terms by never seeming too eager to borrow, never seeming too excited. There was one time when he's walking down the street, he really needs 15, 000. He needs it like yesterday, right? And a banker pulls up and says, Hey Rockefeller, I got 50, 000. I'm trying to deploy. Do you have any use for it? And. Rockefeller says can you give me 24 hours to think it over? And so by doing that, he makes it seem like he's not urgent. He's not desperate to raise the money and therefore he gets the money on better terms than he might have. He seemed like he really needed it, which he did. I should mention he is redlining it the entire time. So he is, there are times when the business almost goes under because he's so leveraged. Um, one time a, refinery burns down, which they very often did. They were huge fire hazards. So one of his refineries burns down and he yet hadn't yet been compensated by insurance. And so he's just. He needs the capital or they're going to go out of business and no one's lending to him. But he had a really good reputation with many of the biggest banks because he was so consistent and so honest that when there was an exceptional circumstance, like a refinery burning down, they believed him.

And then the bank ' s director Stillman Witt in the middle of Rockefeller: this sees this and he goes and he says, Hey, give me my personal safe. And he brings in the safe and he starts taking out money and says, quote here, gentlemen, these young men are all okay. And if they want to borrow more money, I want to see this bank advance it without hesitation. And if you want more security here, it is take what you want. There's one rich Cleveland guy. Stephen Harkness, who he was taking a large loan from and Harkness decides to, he's got a son in law. Okay. Got it. So they're actually like. Anyways, they're relatives. Anyways the point is Harkness has quite a bit of money, and says Young man, you can have all the money you want. You are on the right track, and I am with you. I'll make Henry my watchdog. Harkness is like a really successful rich guy. And he was a director of quote, banks, railroads, mining, real estate and manufacturing companies. So, Rockefeller gives up quite a bit of equity and for Harkness who invests a hundred thousand dollars, but this turns out to be more than worth the money because he has all these great connections and he brings in he brings in, um, Flagler and Flagler turns out to be. An exceptional business partner for John D. Rockefeller. He is the Charlie monger to Rockefeller's Warren Buffett. They just immediately liked each other, understood each other push each other. Both were excited about oil. Both just wanted to push and push, and both riled each other up and got each other even more excited. Flagler is an interesting character. He boasted, quote, I have always been contented, but I have never been satisfied. And, Rockefeller was always the one pushing forward, wanting to do more, everyone else was always saying, no, slow down. And so he loved Flagler who quote was always on the active side of every question. And Flagler is basically with him on every question of should we expand faster? Should we go harder? Should we produce more? He's yes. As is Rockefeller. Flagler is this interesting character. He keeps a quote on his desk that says, quote, do unto others as they would do unto you and do it first.

So they have to transport crude oil from Pennsylvania . It goes West to Cleveland and then is Rockefeller: refined there in their refineries. And then they have to ship the final products. This kerosene mostly other products do mostly kerosene. They have to ship that on to other cities. Some of it is going west to, whatever, Kansas City, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana. But most of it is going east, back to New York, Massachusetts, Virginia. The more settled east coast of the United States. This is the 1860s, the west coast is The West is still lightly settled. And Cleveland is a really good position for them because there are multiple railroads that go through Cleveland. Going kind of North directly East and South and of course West. And then, but not only that they've got. The Great Lakes, they're on the Great Lakes. And so they can also ship it. They can put it on barges and, Send it up through, up through Lake Erie to the Erie Canal and and get that way. It's not so important in its own right, but it's important because it allows them to negotiate. They're not beholden. To any one railroad, they can play the railroads. Here's the quote with virtuosic from Chernow with virtuosic brilliance, Rockefeller and Flagler played these three railroads against each other in seemingly endless permutations. At one point one of these railroads, the Pennsylvania railroad declares that they would be quote, wiped out as a refining center. as with a sorry, the Pennsylvania railroad declares that Cleveland would be quote, wiped out as a refining center as with a sponge. Okay, how can they do that? If you'll remember the actual, the only oil wells in the world are in Pennsylvania. So they're basically saying, look, raw oil isn't going anywhere else to get refined. We're going to refine it right here in Pennsylvania. And And then we're going to send it out. Okay. So they can't get the oil. And they can't ship it on the Pennsylvania railroad. So, this is terrible, right? Like you're dead. You can't get oil. You can't get raw oil. You can't get crude oil and you can't export your products. You're dead.

So they completely flip it on the railroad and they built a pipeline from these oil fields to Cleveland bypassing the railroad . And then they actually Rockefeller: use this as a, as leverage on the other railroads saying, Hey, you're going to lose all your oil hauling from us. Unless you give us so like you got to help us out here because we're being attacked by the Pennsylvania railroad. So they get extreme concessions, your traffic is going to be decreasing from all of these Cleveland railroads, but we can make it up. We have this pipeline. If you give us good prices, if you give us some concessions, so they turn their geographic disadvantage into about powerful bargaining tool and secured covert rates that allowed them to, this is a quote. Quote, in other words, the young Cleveland refiners cannily converted their geographic disadvantage in to a powerful bargaining tool and secured covert rates that allow them to ship crude oil to Cleveland and then refined oil to New York for only 1. 65 per barrel compared to an officially listed rate of 2 and 40 cents. But the main thing that they offer is just volume. So they make a lot of concessions. They don't want this to just be them squeezing the railroads. They want everyone to win. They, offer to stop sending stuff by ship through the Erie Canal. They offer to assume legal liability for fire and other accidents. But most of all, they offer them 60 carloads of refined oil daily. Okay, and that is single destination to single destination. So they don't have to pick up anything else. They can just go, Cleveland to New York. It's great. It's really great for them. Of course, they actually didn't have 60 carloads daily, so they would have to beef up their production quite a bit. So they're going to have to coordinate with other refiners, but that's fine by them. They basically then will have these refiners in their pocket, right? Because it's only by the grace of Rockefeller that they're able to ship their oil with these great rates. This is just incredible operational efficiency for everyone. Okay. But this is very controversial. This is something that'd be extremely controversial is they're receiving of rebates from, the railroads. So the railroads, technically are like a public utility. And so everyone is supposed to have equal access to them as a public carrier. In other words, anyone. It is supposed to be able to ship something on the railroad for X dollars, per carload.

There were a lot of carve outs . It Rockefeller: was like Swiss cheese, but but this is them getting a deal to get rebates. They're going to get preferential treatment from the railroad. Now, of course, like It's pretty understandable. This is great for the railroads because, more volume is more consistent. It's more regular. They can count on it again. They have to make, they don't have to make as many stops for each train. It makes a lot of sense for them, but with the public is like this practice, which would only grow and grow of getting. More and more rebates. And the reason it's a rebate is because, They're charging the officially listed price, so they're just saying give me, giving them a rebate. Whatever they're not, it's technical jargon instead of just saying we're charging them less. Anyway, these rebates would be very controversial, but from this moment The train companies have an incentive. For this monop, for this big conglomerate to just grow and grow so that they can do more volume on more predictable terms. Because this is so controversial, this deal is actually never committed to paper. This is just a handshake agreement. And Rockefeller, who is now doing more and more kind of shady business practices, but still views himself as like God's ultimate servant, the ultimate Baptist, he always puts a nice veneer on it. He says, quote, our people did not think it would be best for the Lake shore road or us to have a contract. You just cut that out. Our people do not think it would be best for us to have a contract. But with the good faith between us and desire to promote each other's interest, we can serve each other better by being able to say we have no contracts. One of the things that made Rockefeller such a great negotiator, and he was a very good negotiator, is that he didn't bowl people over. He generally tried to make it a win and had them and gave people incentives to buy in. Okay, now, so this is a total coup for Rockefeller, however, just a year later, people continue to jump into the refining business. And so just a year later refining capacity is triple what the market needs. So there's just like way too much refining capacity that's creating a glut of product, which is creating really low prices, which is killing everyone. So the entire industry is facing ruin. Rockefeller estimated that", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/rockefeller", "title": "Rockefeller", "chunk_index": 20, "publication_date": "2024-02-24", "total_chunks_in_doc": 37}}
{"text": "is triple what the market needs . So there ' s just like way too much refining capacity that ' s creating a glut of product , which is creating really low prices , which is killing everyone . So the entire industry is facing ruin . Rockefeller estimated that Rockefeller: 90 percent of all refiners were headed towards bankruptcy. We're losing money. And how do you solve this? What a terrible situation. And there's no way to solve it without taking control of the entire industry. Let me repeat that. There's no way to solve it without taking control of the entire industry. Now, most people, when they hear that think, man, there's no way to solve it without, taking control of the entire industry. Rockefeller, he just hears, okay, there is a solution. It's taking over the entire industry. And that's the moment that he decides that's exactly what he's going to do. Um, these years, 1869, 1870 is when he starts to conceive of his new idea of cooperation rather than competition. The idea being, look, when we're competing with each other, we're driving each other out of business. There's too much. Refining capacity. And the problem is once you have built the refinery yes, you're operating in the red, but you still want to refine anything that you can in order to lessen your debt obligations, therefore it's a. A prisoner's dilemma situation. What's best for me is what's worst for everyone. Right? So he makes preparation for this by first establishing a joint stock firm. So he abolishes Rockefeller Andrews and Flagler and establishes the standard oil company. And, standard oil is supposed to be, this is the standard. It's a very good name, I think. It gives the impression of quality and competence and ubiquity and the uniform quality of their products. And so they raise a million dollars. At this phase of his career, Rockefeller's answered to every. Every problem is raise more money and go bigger. So it's already a mini empire. It controls 10 percent of American petroleum refining, as well as barrel making plant, warehouses, shipping facilities, and a fleet of tank cars. And even despite these really difficult circumstances, because they're so operationally efficient, they continue to turn a modest profit. They managed to turn a healthy profit in 1871. So the next year standard oil meets with the three most powerful railroads, the Pennsylvania, the New York central, and the Erie, and a handful of other refiners. And they have this idea that we are, going to establish something called the Southern the South improvement company. And the idea is basically similar to what", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/rockefeller", "title": "Rockefeller", "chunk_index": 21, "publication_date": "2024-02-24", "total_chunks_in_doc": 37}}

And they have this idea that we are , going to establish something called the Southern the South improvement company . And the idea is basically similar to what Rockefeller: they did before, which is look, we're going to give, we as railroads are going to give preferential treatment to these specific refiners. We're going to give you rebates. And not only are we going to give you rebates, but we're going to give you something called drawbacks, which is not only are we going to give you, are we going to pay you? A little discount, a little, a little rebate every time we ship your oil. But every time a competitor ships their oil on our rail lines, we're going to give you a drawback. So like our incentives are totally aligned. So what this means is that for non SIC, South Improvement Company refiners, like this is the end, it's going to increase their costs for shipping oil dramatically, and it's going to reduce costs dramatically for SIC companies. One Rockefeller biography called it quote, an instrument of competitive cruelty, unparalleled in the industry. Unparalleled in industry. And they get competitive information about their competitors in intelligence, essentially, which allows them to underpriced them. Okay. This is actually good. How's this good for the railroads then? Because the railroads are also interested in cooperation. So rather than, they too were driving themselves broke competing with each other. So you say, look, um. We'll reduce your rates a lot, but you act as a leveler for us. You act as an evener, standard oil would act as an evener is what it's called. To make sure that each received a predetermined share of the oil traffic. Okay, so we're gonna reduce the rates, but we're gonna stop this downward spiral of you can't play us off each other anymore in order to get us to lower our rates. And then there's another factor, which is Rockefeller had been accumulating all of these tank cars, which were a primitive version of what you now see as an oil tanker. So it's just like a train car with just one big giant container for oil. Previously it had all been in barrels, which is a problem because they crack and they break and then the barrels themselves take up a lot of room. And so you don't ship as much oil. This is great.

Rockefeller ' s supreme insight was that he could solve the oil industry ' s problems by solving the railroads problems at the same time , creating a Rockefeller: double cartel in oil and rails. Okay. It is a double cartel. And so this creates riots, especially in the oil producing region of Pennsylvania. Oh, this is the quote I wanted to go earlier. You can abuse me. You can strike me. So long as you let me have my way That's a great quote from Rockefeller. You can abuse me. You can strike me so long as you let me have my way So they get boycotted Which has a terrible toll on them and then eventually Pennsylvania revokes the charter to Eventually, Pennsylvania is threatening to revoke their charter and The train companies say, okay, this is way too much blow back. We're going to tear up the SIC. Okay. Good idea but we can't follow through on this. And so the SIC falls apart. So failure, right? Wrong. Because before it is torn up Rockefeller conducts. His infamous Cleveland massacre, which is between February 17th and March 28th, 1872. Between the first rumors of the SIC and the time it was scuttled, he manages to acquire 22 of his 26 Cleveland competitors. I think it's interesting. What do you do? How do you go about these companies? Do you start with the small ones or you start with the big ones? You might start think start small, get some wins and work your way up. But no. He did the opposite. He goes to the biggest refiners first and buys them sometimes overpaying a little bit, but this just feeds the fear and hysteria, right? These other refiners have heard about this SIC. They're like, Oh man we're scared. We were not going to be able to ship our oil. Standard is going to crush us. And then they hear that he has acquired his next best competitor. And now they're just shaking in their boots. They're beaten already. And so when he comes through and says Hey, I'll acquire you for 10 cents on the dollar. They're like, and if you don't, you're going out of business. And this is what he says, quote. You talk earnestly to his rivals, tapping them on the knee or gesturing with his hands, reasoning with them in richly cadenced evangelical tones.

We will give you representation. We will unite together and build a substantial structure on the basis of cooperation. Similarly, we here at Cleveland are at a disadvantage. Something should be done for a mutual protection. We think this plan of ours is a good scheme. Think it over. We would be glad to consider it with you. If you are so inclined, of course, as we saw at the beginning of this episode with the famous incident from this time period, Even if you're not scared to have your hand cut off, the body will still feel pain. He can also be a little bit more aggressive than that when necessary. And he's paying them pennies on the dollar, typically a quarter of their construction costs. On the one hand, it's oh, they're being taken advantage of. On the other hand, it's, they were gonna go out of business. Again, three times the refining capacity. As was actually necessary. And so what he's saying is look, man, I'm saving these people. They're getting something. I'm giving them some money and guess what? I'm offering them stock in the standard oil company. I'm making that an option. Most people don't take it. Most people take cash and, but that's their fault. He offers them all stock. He really is is evangelical about standard oil. He's look, we're going to cooperate. We're gonna get together. Yeah, I'm gonna buy you out. You're gonna get something for your refinery instead of nothing because you're headed towards bankruptcy anyway. So this is a good deal. This is what Schirnau has to say. I quote, Rockefeller probably paid a fair price for many antiquated plate plants, but it was a bitter pill for the ruined owners to swallow. And he operated in a climate of fear that gave rival his rivals little choice in the matter. And we should know it's a climate of fear that he obviously helped to create. So with many of these refiners, again, this is why he's saying I'm actually the nice guy here. If they have good up to date refineries, he keeps them around.

In fact when he starts doing this in other cities, he next goes to Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, and eventually goes to Baltimore and people start catching on and they start. creating refineries when Rockefeller comes to town just so that they can get bought out. Okay, in 1873, so Standard Oil is really growing and is quickly becoming the top oil concern in the country. So there's a huge So after 1873, there's a huge panic, essentially a big recession, a depression and oil starts trading for incredibly cheap. There's this huge glut of oil still. Rockefeller slashes standard oils, dividend increases cash reserves and it starts buying up. Other this is where he's buying up other refineries. Actually, this is when he really takes over Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. And by the way, he's not just taking over the refineries. Often he's taking on the executive team and he leaves them in place to run their refinery and converts them into standard oil stockholders. Which creates some really good incentives for him. This was not a common, this seems so obvious to you yet. Oh, okay. He's giving some options to to his employees. Yeah. It seems simple. No one else is doing this, right? Using. Using stock in order to align people's incentives and bring them onto the team, really get them invested in the company is a new idea. It's these people are like real converts. They love standard oil. And in fact one guy. Camden is one of his top lieutenants who had owned other refineries. And it's exactly what I told you, right? They're buying out some of these people and some people, and some executives don't want to buy out these refineries. They're like, they're going to fail. Let's just starve them out. But Rockefeller wants to expand faster, drive them out sooner consolidate faster, and just. Own oil and don't leave room for anyone else to come in, keep the momentum going forward. And Camden says, quote, it almost makes me weepy to pay out good money for this kind of junk. Was that it? But as it is a part of our duty to mankind, I suppose it is necessary to carry it through without flinching oh man. It makes me weepy to be paying money to become a monopoly.

I think we should just take it . Yeah , it makes him weepy Rockefeller: to become a monopoly in the most valuable business in the world. So anyway, by the mid 1870s, John D Rockefeller, still just in his thirties is the sole master of American oil refining. It's not a true monopoly. And in fact, they would always. Keep around some refiners. They would let, 10 percent of the market exists so that they could claim that it wasn't a monopoly. They ended up acquiring over 90 percent of the refining capacity in the United States. And as they acquire more and more refineries, they make it harder on the remaining refineries by once again, pinching the railroads, extracting rebates and drawbacks. And, um, just doing everything and make it more expensive for others to refine and ship oil. To show you how far they could go, there is one challenge to them. And that is a seaboard pipeline. So this is a pipeline that is supposed to go from oil country in Pennsylvania out to Delaware, I think, to be refined on the coast. Maybe it's New York. Now I told you there were pipelines. And there were, but there were no long distance pipelines like this, to go from Western Pennsylvania all the way to the coast. This was a monumental undertaking and standard oil opposes this pipeline like crazy. So some of the executives. Recommend let's just smash it up. Let's just get some goons in the middle of the night and smash up this pipeline. And Rockefeller says no. I'm willing to do almost anything to crush my enemies, but not quite that. I'm, I am a church boy. And so one of the subordinates writes to Rockefeller quote, I would have no mercy on them that don't deserve nor appreciate it. So first they go to manufacturers. It's called the tidewater. So they, anyone who works with them, they're like, Hey, you're getting blacklisted if you work with them at all. And any refiners who might work with Tidewater, they tell them, Hey, we'll give you a super low rates on standard oil pipelines and transportation. And he bought other refineries that might be Tidewater customers. So it was increasing his market share beyond 90%. And then when that's not fully working, Tidewater somehow is still managing to cobble together the resources to build this pipeline. They start buying what are called deadlines. So that is, they buy a strip of land from the North of Pennsylvania to the South of Pennsylvania.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/rockefeller", "title": "Rockefeller", "chunk_index": 26, "publication_date": "2024-02-24", "total_chunks_in_doc": 37}}

Rockefeller: So they just start going to all these farmers and they're like, Hey, can we have just a little parcel of your land? We'll overpay you for it. They're like, Oh, okay. So now they've got a North South strip that Tidewater can't get through. Right. But Tidewater, still manages to To get around this and then they declare legislative war. They're getting they go to all these state legislature, legislatures and tell them, Hey, you got to block the formation of this pipeline. And so they do, and they actually have to adjust the pipeline. And they, they can't get all the way to the coast in the end. However, despite all this. The Tidewater company really needs to be commended because they've managed to get through all this and they managed to construct their pipeline. Okay. But it's amazing because they go to all this work. And then in 1880, shortly after it's constructed, they go to the standard oil and they're like, Hey, we'd really love to meet. Their executive says to the standard oil executive quote he felt that the time had come. When the company should work together with a view of preventing other companies from engaging in the business. So essentially, Tidewater comes in and says, Hey, we can, we're this long distance pipeline. We can ship cheaper than the railroads. And, but then they have to do it for cheaper. And they're like, this kind of sucks. So they come to standard oil and they're like, Hey, what if we work together? And we just both raise our prices. So, within a year they are drawn into the standard oil orbit and this threat to their business goes away. One thing is you think about all this extra capacity, one thing Rockefeller is working at this entire time is. We need to export a lot of a lot of this kerosene, a lot of this oil, and get it out to the world. Because they can soak up the extra capacity. And so they're exporting more and more of it. So more and more, they're sending their crude oil to the seaboard, to the East Coast, to be refined there. And then they're exporting it, and they're shipping it mainly from New York. And so more and more, His business is taking him to New York and in 1883, he moves to New", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/rockefeller", "title": "Rockefeller", "chunk_index": 27, "publication_date": "2024-02-24", "total_chunks_in_doc": 37}}

And so more and more , His business is taking him to New York and in 1883 , he moves to New Rockefeller: York around the same time, actually just a year earlier in 1882, as time goes on, they're dealing with more and more legal challenges. And one of the reasons they're susceptible to so many legal challenges is that the United States at this time, really the States were sovereign. It was just a patchwork of States and there were, hardly any rules set up for interstate companies. Like generally you needed a different company for each state that you were operating in and, And companies couldn't own proper, especially property in other States. This is a real problem, right? Especially for a growing. now international company like Standard Oil. And so they come up with this trust agreement which is essentially, they say, okay, this isn't, this isn't a company out of Ohio that has property everywhere. Actually, this is just a series of companies that all happen to have the same. Shareholders and they pay dividends to, to those shareholders and they're dictated by the board by this trust that happens to have the same members as the board of the Standard Oil Company. So it's a pretty clever workaround and it creates a system where people can own securities, can own stock in the entire company, essentially. Now, just when they're masters of the oil world in the 1870s oil is discovered in Russia and it's extremely plentiful, which makes it very cheap and so immediately there is a battle for Europe and Rockefeller who. Has never heard the phrase anti competitive practices in his life and certainly doesn't believe in them. Um, raises prices cuts prices dramatically in Europe to undercut his Russian competitors and try and smother their industry before it can really grow. And in order to compensate raises prices in the U S where he has a monopoly and can just raise prices at will to make up for it. One of the things that they need to do in order to compete is they need predictable sales. And so they modernize, they start creating an international company and they integrate vertically. What they do is they had before these kind of wholesalers, these wagons that would go in and sell. And so they start driving these guys out of business and selling directly to to these general stores. And, um, they really bully them. They tell them, Hey, you are going to sell standard oil and you're only going to sell standard oil.

And if we catch you selling other oil , then we are not above creating a competitor and we ' re going Rockefeller: to sell groceries at cost just to drive you out of business. If you sell anyone except for standard oil, and they do this a couple of times, they build these general stores to drive people out of business, these grocery stores. So they have now sales agents to control the process all the way from refining to the end point sale. And in fact Territory leaders they were called station agents or station managers, sorry, territory leaders. They're called station managers were expected to command at least 85 percent and if possible, much more of the oil trade in their district. So they get, they take really aggressive tactics to drive others out of their business. It's like textbook monopolistic, anti competitive behavior. Okay. In the 1880s, they started their natural gas business. So in, as part of this vertical integration, there are some new fields discovered in Ohio. And it has a problem. People refer to it as skunk oil. And so this Ohio oil, people think, eh, we don't know if it's worth anything compared to Pennsylvania oil, but Rockefeller had these almost oracular powers. Like he's one of the best decision makers I've ever seen. He's just like on major decisions in his career. He's 19 for 20. He was like one slip up. Otherwise incredible decision making. And this is one where he says no, we're, I believe in Ohio oil. We are going to buy these oil fields. And at first they're just storing it. Just this oil comes out of the ground. It's called Lima, it's near the city called Lima, and so it's called Lima oil or skunk oil, and they just started storing and they have over 40 million barrels worth of Lima oil in storage tanks. And this stuff can only sell for 15 cents per barrel. It's just completely valueless. People think Rockefeller has lost his mind. But he hires this chemist and has him work and work. And eventually. He finds a way to process the oil to completely remove the smell. It's called skunk oil because it has a high level of sulfur in it. So when you burn it, it smells. It smells really bad. And he figures out how to refine it. He figures out how to clean it of the stench. And it becomes really valuable.

And they never got a monopoly on crude oil production , the way they ' ve done the rest of the Rockefeller: process, and they didn't want it. At their height, they controlled 30%. American production, but it was enough to ensure that they always had a 33 percent in nine in 1898 is is when they controlled the most crude production, but 33 percent controls is still a lot of control, right? And it was enough to ensure that they had a steady supply of crude and and to make that a part of their vertical integration. As I said, lots of legal challenges. And in 1890 their bad reputation catches up to them. And president Harrison signs the Sherman antitrust act, which outlawed trusts and combinations in restraint of trade and subjected violators of fines up to 5, 000. Now, key line there in restraint of trade. So this main, the main reason that this has passed is to restrain the standard oil company. They just. Kind of move along as if it were never passed They just ignore It and say well that doesn't apply to us. We're not in restraint of trade and For 17 years the law is not applied to them And so they just they sidestep it and they move past the Sherman Antitrust Act. So in 1890 At this point, Rockefeller is definitely one of the richest men in America. He's probably top five. The thing that would actually push him over the edge is he makes to number two was some smart investments in mining, which was Andrew Carnegie's wheelhouse. But Rockefeller actually Find some really good minds that Carnegie had passed on and again, with his like foresight, somehow he always knows what's going to happen. He buys up these minds and when they start producing really great ore, he ends up selling them. That vaults him up into second place. Now with all this money, he's been charitable the entire time. He's giving it away. But now he's making a name for himself. Everyone knows Mr. Rockefeller. And so he is continually just besieged with requests for his money. And he really wants to help everyone. And so the stress of the Sherman antitrust act, more and more legal attacks on standard oil combined with. More and more requests for charitable contributions leads to something like a nervous breakdown.

And and so he begins on an early retirement now , so he starts to Rockefeller: pull back in 1889. There actually, within a few years is a major recession in 1893. So he gets pulled back in to steady the ship. And not just steady the ship. So he regains some of his health between 1889 and 1893. And only does he pull standard oil through the crisis, the country as a whole, and he's making loans everywhere. Cause he's has this enormous fortune by this point. He's got millions and millions of dollars. So he's bailing people out. He's trying to steady wall street. And once he does that, then finally after a couple of years, he starts to fade out again in 1897, he really retires and, I think there's something more to it than the health angle. He was always a health nut. But one of his one of his contemporaries said that the business quote had ceased to amuse him. It lacked freshness and variety and had become merely irksome and he withdrew. And I think that you can understand that. Like he had consolidated oil, all that was left to do. There was no growth necessarily left at the time. That was obvious, although he would get. Much wealthier in the future. Yeah, like the interesting work was done to him. After all this, and after the U S steel deal that he does with his minds his net worth, his personal net worth moves to more than 200 million, and this would mark the, he's still behind Andrew Carnegie is the richest man in America, but Carnegie. Was, at the peak of his powers and Rockefeller was just getting started. I'll just, spoil the ending. I'll talk more about this in the second episode in the end notes episode, but the thing that pushes him to, okay. 3. 5 billion. That's a great fortune. That's a ton of money. But what pushes it pushes him to. Just the richest man in the world has ever seen is of course, the invention of the automobile and Henry Ford and the automobile becoming, widespread all over the world that of course increases demand. We've been talking about oil this entire time and, gasoline is used a little bit. But when we think oil, we think gasoline and no kerosene is by far the biggest use. And so as gasoline becomes.

Okay , so there you ' ve seen it . Rockefeller becomes , the king Rockefeller: of American oil by, through extreme strong arm tactics, through incredible attention to detail, Through incredible focus, through long term planning, through great decision making. So let's talk about how he managed and how he led. And let me start off by saying Rockefeller didn't think that he was anything special as a leader. He thought it was a completely learner completely learnable skill. He said, quote, the ability to deal with people is as purchasable a commodity as sugar or coffee. And I pay more for that ability than for any other under the sun. Okay. So how did you do it? So if you can just learn to lead like Rockefeller, if it's as purchasable as sugar or coffee, then how do you do it? So one thing is that just like Napoleon and his cannons, just like Steve jobs. And one thing is that he was detail oriented. Okay. All these great leaders are extremely detail oriented. There's the great story of Walt Disney. Anytime they brought a. A cartoon to him. He'd say can I see it a few more ways? He always he always wanted different looks at it. Same Steve jobs. There's this famous story of him getting into the weeds and into the details of the color on a certain presentation. And he keeps asking them to change the green, the color of the green. And he doesn't like it until finally. They change it and he likes it. He says, great green. And so everyone walks around mocking him. Great green. They thought that was funny. And Napoleon, of course, was famously into the details of, even by hand, positioning his cannons. That's why he was known as Le Petit Corporal. I could go on, but great leaders are always detail oriented. Here's a great quote from Chernow quote. As a former bookkeeper, Rockefeller devoted special attention to ledgers. One accountant recalled him stopping by his desk and saying courteously, permit me, then flipping quickly through the books. Very well kept. He said, very indeed. Then his eyes leapt to a tiny error, a little error here. Will you correct it? The accountant was flabbergasted by the speed with which Rockefeller had scanned so many dense columns of figures. And I will take my oath, he reported, that it was the only error in the book. The, one of the other big things about Rockefeller is his consistency.

{"text": "dense columns of figures . And I will take my oath , he reported , that it was the only error in the book . The , one of the other big things about Rockefeller is his consistency . Listen to this passage , this is another great passage . Rockefeller: Quote, he walked with a measured gait, steady as a metronome, always covering the same distance in the exact same time. He had the soundless movements and modulated voice of an undertaker. Gliding about with silent footfalls, he startled people by materializing at their desks and politely asking in a mellow voice to inspect their work. So he's incredibly Consistent. He has incredible powers of concentration. I love this quote from Rockefeller himself. Do not many of us who fail to achieve big things fail because we lack concentration, the art of concentrating the mind on the thing to be done at the proper time and to the exclusion of everything else. I actually think more than anything, this explains the success of Rockefeller. Again, he was not a super genius as can be deduced from his academic record as a young man. Like he just wasn't, he wasn't. He was very smart, but he wasn't that brilliant. He's not like a Thomas Edison type where you're like, Oh man, this guy's just so smart. No. But what he was incredibly focused. And then I would add to that determination, just determined. But it's just like you said, the art of concentrating the mind on the thing to be done at the proper time and to the exclusion of everything else. I think that explains a lot about why he was so successful. He used silence to his benefit. He would be very quiet and he would listen and then, he would respond a little bit, but if he disapproved of something, he would get very quiet and he just wouldn't respond. So everyone noted his calm. He was even tempered by nature. You could say the most outrageous things, you could yell, you could scream, and he just didn't react. Okay, I've been describing him as the Terminator, but he was he was legitimately good with people. He remembered everyone, he remembered their names, he always had a kind word for them. It was never too excited, right? It was never like over enthused. Oh, I love you. You're the best. It's just, hello, good day, fine work and that, that kind of vibe. And then the other thing is, someone was asking me the other day, does every great achiever have a posse? And I responded immediately yes. Every single one of them has a tribe. And that is true for Rockefeller as well. He had this small", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/rockefeller", "title": "Rockefeller", "chunk_index": 33, "publication_date": "2024-02-24", "total_chunks_in_doc": 37}}
{"text": "then the other thing is , someone was asking me the other day , does every great achiever have a posse ? And I responded immediately yes . Every single one of them has a tribe . And that is true for Rockefeller as well . He had this small Rockefeller: group of great executives that he surrounded himself. I mentioned Flagler. There's this guy Archibald there's Camden there a handful of others, but these his brother, William and these people were. Just really talented. He paid them really well. A lot of them became, not as rich as him because he, but kajillionaires. And so his ability to build up and acquire people around him who are really talented was crucial and he put a ton of value on it. So here's another quote, quote, so highly did Rockefeller value personnel that during the first years of standard oil, he personally attended to routine hiring matters. After parentheses, after conquering the other refining centers, the payroll ballooned to 3000 people and this became impossible. And then it says, taking for granted the growth of his empire. He hired talented people as found, not as needed. In other words, if he found a really talented person that he believed in, if he didn't have a position for them, he wasn't like, Oh, sorry. Can you check back later? He was like, Nope, I am snatching you up right now. And we'll find a spot for you. We'll find something for you to do. Another thing is. Because he believed it was so important to hire well and to have these people motivated employees were invited to send complaints or suggestions directly to him. And, and he would look them over. He was also reasonably generous, is what it says. Reasonably generous in wages, salaries, and pensions. He paid somewhat above the industry average. So he's a frugal guy. He's never going to pay extravagant salaries. He paid somewhat above industry average in order to attract bright people. And that went for all levels. At the top levels, he incentivized these people with not with extravagant salaries, but with standard stock. And then this is something I found really interesting. If you just listen to the last episode, to the Mr. Beast episode, I thought one of the most interesting things that he said was, that he doesn't have any training procedures that his procedure is. You hire really talented people and then you stick them with the person that they're, whose job they're taking over, who they're supposed to learn from. And then they just stay attached to them. They just sit with them and then they're tutored by them until they're ready to go.

They just sit with them and then they ' re tutored by them until they ' re ready to go . And that is exactly Rockefeller: what Rockefeller does. Here's the quote from the Chernow book. Quote, To orchestrate such a gigantic operation, he had to delegate authority. And part of the standard oil gospel was to train your subordinate to do your job. As Rockefeller instructed a recruit. Quote, Has anyone given you the law of these offices? No. It is this, nobody does anything if he can get anybody else to do it. Okay. Then the other thing is, this Steve Jobs idea of be a benchmark of quality. So here's another great quote, most of all Rockefeller inspired subordinates with his fantastic, with his fanatic perfectionism. He never did anything haphazardly and wrote hundreds of thousands of business letters that were models of concision and balanced phrasing the product of painstaking. Revision this is this quote. I actually can't remember who said it, but I'll tell you that I stole it from David Senra from his podcast founders. But he says that the founder is the soul of the company. And I think that comes down to this, to being a yardstick of quality. What is the standard, standard oil? What is the standard? What is perfection? And then demanding that. Most of all, Rockefeller inspired subordinates with fanatic perfectionism. And then one other thing that I think is interesting, I haven't seen anyone else do this, so I won't say that it's a pattern, but it's so different that I think it's worth highlighting, which is that he insisted on unanimity. Had this board of really talented people, and he said, um, he wouldn't make major decisions without unanimous consent from the board. And, sometimes they would feud and they would bicker but, eventually they would come around. There's one great story where one of the old timers is it was actually with the Lima oil, with the skunk oil, and he just would not go along with it. He was scared like a grandmother, as he said at the beginning and Rockefeller takes out his checkbook and says, okay. Then I will, he's the last holdout and so they can't get unanimous consent. So they're not going to buy the fields and Rockefeller says, okay I am going to personally lend the money for my personal accounts to buy these And he whips out his checkbook ready to write a check on his own account at which point the guy Gives in and says okay John if you feel so strongly about it that you are Willing to put your", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/rockefeller", "title": "Rockefeller", "chunk_index": 35, "publication_date": "2024-02-24", "total_chunks_in_doc": 37}}

The Wright brothers had tried to invite the locals, but only a few were interested. Afterwards, they tried to tell the newspapers, but no one believed them. And so, as Orville and Wilbur Wright took the train home to Dayton, they were something like a secret society. They talked in conspiratorial tones about what the future held. What improvements they would make and what new tests they would conduct. The world might not know, might not believe. But the brothers knew.

So with that out of the way, let‚Äôs dive in, after this quick break. *** AD BREAK *** Family Life It all began with a toy. Milton Wright was a Bishop, a fairly high ranking clergyman for the Church of the United Brethren in Christ.He traveled often for work, and often brought back gifts for his children.And this time, he brought back a small helicopterYou wound the rubber band and let it go and the little wooden propellers carried it through the air‚ÄúLook here, boys,‚Äù said the bishop, concealing it in his hands. When he let go, it flew to the ceiling.‚ÄùLater, when Orville was in first grade, his teacher caught him tinkering with bits of wood at his desk. She asked him what he was doing, and he told her he was building a machine that he and his brother would fly someday.By his brother, he meant Wilbur. They had two older brothers and a sister, but Wilbur and Orville were inseparable. They acted similarly, thought similarly, and always did things together. Their father called them ‚ÄúAs inseparable as twins‚Äù and ‚Äúindispensable to one another.‚Äù Though born four years apart, they were indeed like twins. Throughout their life they would work together, live together, and in later years even maintain a joint bank account.They were close with the rest of their family too. It was a tight knit group.They would call Dayton, Ohio home for their entire lives.Willbur was later to say ‚ÄúIf I were giving a young man advice as to how he might Succeed in life.

I would say to him pick out a good father and mother and begin life in Wright Brothers (Part 1): Ohio.‚ÄùIt reminds me of a speaking engagement I did last year in front of a bunch of successful entrepreneurs and I did a panel and the MC asked us what the hardest lesson was that we learned from our fathers and the first person said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do cocaine‚Äù because his father had been a coke head. And then all of these people talked about how their horrible fathers had spurred them to success in life because they wanted to prove them wrong or escape their shadow or something like that.And I was just thinking man, am I at a disadvantage in life because I had a loving father and mother?So it‚Äôs nice to see from the Wright Brothers that you can have success even if you have a supportive and loving family.Wilbur was born in 1867 and Orville was born in 1871. So they are growing up at an interesting time. They grew up in the era of horses and buggies, saw early automobiles when they were young men, and then Orville, the younger of the two lived to see supersonic flight and if he had lived to 98 would have lived to see the moon landing.Which is always amazing to me to think about. For thousands of years humans got around on foot or on horses. And then in a single lifetime we went from horses to moon landings.Anyway, the point is, the Wright brothers grew up without running water, plumbing, or electricity. Nevertheless, it was a good middle class upbringing in a booming manufacturing town.Their father was intellectually curious, he had a larger than normal library and encouraged his sons to read and experiment.Of the two, Orville was the more entrepreneurial. He began making kites at age 10 for fun and then started to sell them. And then while in high school he got an enthusiasm for newspapers and he used scrap metal and discarded materials, including an unused tombstone, to make a homemade printing press.Wilbur of course eventually joined the printing business and they started their own newspaper business which did modestly well.Wilbur was the more serious and intellectual of the two. In fact while they were both brilliant, Wilbur is the one who you might say is a genius.He was a classic shy, lost in the clouds, thinker of a boy.McCullough \"Such were Wilbur's powers of concentration that to some he seemed a little strange. He could cut himself off from everyone.‚ÄùA classmate said ‚ÄúThe strongest impression one gets of Wilbur Wright is of a man who lives largely in a world of his own.‚ÄùHe said it was common", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/wright-brothers", "title": "Wright Brothers (Part 1)", "chunk_index": 2, "publication_date": "2023-10-22", "total_chunks_in_doc": 13}}

If you look at a picture of him, he doesn‚Äôt look like a nerd, he‚Äôs got a pretty impressive jaw and indeed he was a star athlete, especially at football, skating, and gymnastics.In fact, there was serious talk of him going to Yale. But then in 1885 when he is 18 years old he is playing hockey on a frozen lake when a neighborhood thug wacks him in the face with a hockey stick.It knocks out his front teeth, in retrospect it‚Äôs pretty clear that he had a pretty severe concussion, and that sends him into a downward spiral of depression that lasts for years.For the next three years he is more or less homebound as he regains his confidence after this traumatic assault.It‚Äôs also probably worsened by the fact that during this time, his mom contracts tuberculosis and so he spends most of his time at home caring for his mother.Other than taking care of his mother, the other thing that consumes him is reading. MucCullough says of the Wright household \"Everyone in the house read all the time.\"The Bishop kept an unusually large library for the time, and it included Dickens, Washington Irving, Hawthorne, Mark Twain, a complete set of the works of Sir Walter Scott, the poems of Virgil, Plutarch's Lives, Milton's Paradise Lost, Boswell's Life of Johnson, Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Thucydides, Darwin's On the Origin of Species, plus two full sets of encyclopedias and more.And being widely read is something that would come back to benefit Wilbur greatly.Well Mrs. Wright dies in 1889, and this is a very serious hardship on the family. But paradoxically it seems to set Wilbur free, as he had fixated on her in her illness and really didn‚Äôt pursue any sort of career or vocation while she was sick.But without needing to care for his bed-ridden mother, Wilbur could close the book on the recluse chapter of his life and move forward with the printing business, and then with a new obsession which he and Orville would discover four years later in 1893. *** SOUND EFFECT OF A RINGING BELL AND SOME EXCITING MUSIC *** In the 1890s, bicycle-mania hit the United States.

{"text": "later in 1893 . * * * SOUND EFFECT OF A RINGING BELL AND SOME EXCITING MUSIC * * * In the 1890s , bicycle - mania hit the United States . The 1870s and 1880s had seen a number of novelty bikes for enthusiasts , so think of those Wright Brothers (Part 1): bicycles with the one huge wheel and the one tiny wheel. But in the late 1880s and especially in the early 1890s, the safety bicycle started to take off. And that‚Äôs a bicycle as we think of it today, two wheels of roughly the same size and a lower seat so that a person can put their feet on the ground when they‚Äôre not riding the bike. And bicyclemania hits not only Dayton, but the Wright household. Orville is the one who catches the fever. Between the two brothers you can kind of think of Orville as the heart and Wilbur as the brain. Now that is a little unfair because Orville was also very intelligent and Wilbur was also enthusiastic, but of the two, Orville was the more obsessive and Wilbur was the greater genius. And by the way, there is a lesson there. If you have the passion but not the intelligence to pull of what you want to or the inverse, you know you‚Äôre smart or capable but you just aren‚Äôt the type to really obsess about a cause, then you need to find someone who complements you. Well, Orvill was not only passionate but entrepreneurial so in 1893 Wilbur and Orville opened their own small bicycle business, the Wright Cycle Exchange, selling and repairing bicycles only a short walk from their house. And the brothers were very hard-working, very smart, very honest, and mechanically minded so it‚Äôs no surprise that the business takes off. In virtually no time, business was so good that they had to move down the street into larger quarters. They do go through some rough times. The bicycle craze goes through the classic hype cycle. The hype cycle is a concept popularized by the research firm Gartner, and it describes five phases of a new technology. First there is the technology trigger. Something gets invented. Then there is the peak of inflated expectations. That is when you see a mania, just blind optimism completely divorced from reality. And then you have a crash ending in what Gartner calls the trough of disillusionment. And then it slopes gently back up with what is called the slope of enlightenment into what is called the plateau of productivity. You can see this really clearly with the internet. You have a technology trigger in the early 90s, then in the mid to late 90s you have the peak of inflated expectations where every internet startup is getting funded no matter how ridiculous. And then you have the dot com bust, the recession, what Gartner calls the trough of disillusionment.

And then you have the dot com bust , the recession , what Gartner calls the trough of disillusionment . And then over the next 10 years you have the slope Wright Brothers (Part 1): of enlightenment ending at the plateau of productivity. I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve heard, but people are still using the internet. Well, bicycles go through this exact process. There is a craze, and then there is a bust. And the Wright brothers almost go out of business during the bust, during the recession. But then things recover and reach the plateau of productivity. And that trough is good in a way because it separates the fakers from those who know what they are talking about and are really committed to the craft. Well the Wrights were really good so they come out on the other side with a great business that thrives. In 1895 they moved once again into a bigger facility and started manufacturing their own bicycles rather than just reselling and repairing. The advertisement for their first bicycle, the Van Cleve, gives you a peek into their personalities. It reads in part: It will have large tubing, high frame, tool steel bearings, needle wire spokes, narrow tread and every feature of an up to date bicycle. Its weight will be about 20 pounds. We are very certain that no wheel on the market will run easier or wear longer than this one. And we will guarantee it in the most unqualified manner. The thing about innovators is they are often not really trying to innovate. Often they are just trying to do everything right. And that describes the Wright Brothers. It makes me think of the Steve Jobs quote ‚ÄúBe a yardstick of quality. Some people aren't used to an environment where excellence is expected.‚Äù And that pretty well describes the Wrights. They did everything right, they were a yardstick of quality, and they expected excellence. So their bicycles sell really well, and the business is throwing off some very attractive profits that are making them wealthy. Not mega rich but they are doing very well for themselves. And then in 1896, they have another fortunate accident, one that would set them down the road of their ultimate destiny. *** SOUND EFFECT *** Otto Lilenthal loved the idea of flight. Born in Northern Germany, as a boy he studied birds with his brother and together they made strap on wings and attempted to fly with them. While the wings did not work out, eventually Lilenthal was able to create functional gliders. He was a brilliant engineer with some important mining patents to his name, but no business or engineering problem intrigued him the way the problem of flight did. ‚ÄúIt is our duty not to rest,‚Äù Lilenthal wrote, ‚Äúuntil we have attained a perfect", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/wright-brothers", "title": "Wright Brothers (Part 1)", "chunk_index": 5, "publication_date": "2023-10-22", "total_chunks_in_doc": 13}}

On August 9th, 1896, he made four successful glides, some almost 900 feet in length. By some accounts, his last words before his final jump were ‚ÄúSacrifices must be made!‚Äù At some point during his descent, Lilenthal‚Äôs glider pitched downward and he was unable to pull out of a 50-foot free fall. The crash broke his back and killed him. At almost the exact same time, on the other side of the world, Orville Wright contracted typhoid. As he lay in bed, weak and delirious with a 105 degree fever, Wilbur resumed the role of caretaker that he had taken with his sick mother. In particular, Wilbur spent considerable time reading to his brother while he rested in bed. One day, Wilbur read to him an article about Lilenthal‚Äôs death. The fascination with flight that had affected the Wright Brothers as young boys now returned even stronger. They studied the lives and work of other aviation pioneers, including the French experimenter L.P. Mouillard. (please excuse my pronunciation). He wrote a book on flight, and in it he warned that one could be entirely overtaken by solving the problem of flight. \"When once this idea has invaded the brain, it possesses it exclusively\" which certainly proved true for the Wright Brothers. I think possession is a good way to think about their relationship to flying. Their first practical strep comes on Tuesday, May 30, 1899, Wilbur writes a letter to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. Quote, \"I have been interested in the problem of mechanical and human flight ever since as a boy I constructed a number of bats of various sizes after the style of Cayley's and Pennaud's machines, he began. My observations since have only convinced me more firmly that human flight is possible and practicable. I am about to begin a systematic study of the subject in preparation for practical work. To which I expect to devote what time I can spare for my regular business. I wish to obtain such papers as the Smithsonian Institution has published on this subject, and, if possible, a list of other works in print in the English language.

Flight in the 1890s was Wright Brothers (Part 1): sort of like cold fusion today. There are many brilliant people working on it, but there are also a lot of cranks. And most of the time when you hear about cold fusion or practical fusion, it‚Äôs either crankery or an exaggeration. But like I said, there were smart people working on it as well. There was Lilenthal and Mouillard, Edison and Alexander Graham Bell were both working on it. Hiram Maxim, an American-British inventor, had reportedly spent $100,000 of his own money on a giant steam powered, pilotless flying machine, only to see it crash in attempting to take off. The French government had spent a similar amount on a steam powered flying machine built by a French electrical engineer. And the head of the Smithsonian, to whom Wilbur had just written, was also working on constructing a flying machine. His name was Samuel Langley. Well Langley is very helpful, and sends a bunch of information from the Smithsonian, which helps the brothers get started. And this is a really good approach, why recreate the wheel? Or the wings I guess in this case. Let‚Äôs learn what we can from other people‚Äôs experiments. And so they get a bunch of data from Langley and from a bunch of other early flyers like Lilenthal, and from this guy Octave Chanute, and others. They also start gathering data from even more experienced fliers‚Ä¶ birds. *** Birds or seagull sounds *** Wilbur Wright actually makes a huge breakthrough in flight almost immediately. It‚Äôs very impressive. He‚Äôs watching birds fly, and he notices that they shorten one wing when they roll one way or another. And so Wilbur says, what if we were to have a lever that could fold down or twist the very edge of the wing in order to roll the plane one way or another. Wilbur calls it wing warping. And so they test this with a miniature flier, it‚Äôs actually a kite. Its wingspan is only five feet and it‚Äôs made with bamboo and paper. They send it up in the wind, and test out this wing warping. And wouldn‚Äôt you know it, it works. They twist one side up, which exposes more surface area, generating more lift, so one wing lifts and consequently the other one dips, turning the kite to one side in a rolling motion. Now there is another lesson that the brothers took from the birds, and I think it‚Äôs absolutely genius. They are looking at birds who glide and float on the wind,", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/wright-brothers", "title": "Wright Brothers (Part 1)", "chunk_index": 7, "publication_date": "2023-10-22", "total_chunks_in_doc": 13}}
{"text": "other one dips , turning the kite to one side in a rolling motion . Now there is another lesson that the brothers took from the birds , and I think it ‚Äô s absolutely genius . They are looking at birds who glide and float on the wind , Wright Brothers (Part 1): and realize, look at how often they move their wings. They are constantly making micro adjustments to account for the wind and keep themselves stable. And so the Wright brothers realize that the primary problem of flight is not propulsion or lift, it is control. Lilenthal, that German flier who died, had demonstrated that gliding on the wind is actually very doable, but controlling yourself once you‚Äôre there is very hard - which is ultimately what led to his death. The brothers also crunch the numbers and realize that in the five years that he was testing gliders, Lilenthal had only spent a grand total of 5 hours in the air. And so you can see early on they have a very good theory of how to crack the problem of flight. We have three problems, lift, propulsion, and stability, or in other words wings, engine, and controls. Of the three control is actually the most difficult to solve. And in order to solve it, we‚Äôre going to have to spend a lot of time in the air learning how to pilot an airplane. It‚Äôs a genius approach. It reminds me a lot of the idea of a minimum viable product. This is a philosophy that is really popular in silicon valley and throughout the business world. And the idea that the best approach to development is not to fully finish a product and then launch it, but to build a minimum viable product, the bare bones, and then test it out and get real world customer feedback and add features and polish as time goes on. That‚Äôs the basic idea. And that‚Äôs what the Wright Brothers are going to do. Everyone else, all of their competitors, build these whole flying apparatuses and then unveil them in a big test flight. But the brothers are going to start with the bare bones, and test it in secret. And we‚Äôll hear more about that testing after this quick break. *** AD BREAK *** In order to perform the repetitive flights necessary to master flying, the brothers needed to find a place to conduct their test flights. The ideal spot would have strong steady winds and ideally a soft place to land. To find the right place, Wilbur wrote to the United States Weather Bureau in Washington about prevailing winds around the country. The weather bureau provided extensive records of monthly wind velocities at more than one hundred stations. A village in a remote corner of North Carolina called Kitty Hawk caught his eye. It had very consistent, strong winds and plenty of soft sand to land on. It was", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/wright-brothers", "title": "Wright Brothers (Part 1)", "chunk_index": 8, "publication_date": "2023-10-22", "total_chunks_in_doc": 13}}

It had very consistent , strong winds and plenty of soft sand to land on . It was Wright Brothers (Part 1): also small and completely isolated. But the brothers didn‚Äôt need a luxury vacation. enough for them to take particular interest in a remote spot on the outer banks of North Carolina called Kitty Hawk, some 700 miles from Dayton. Though the famous Kitty Hawk is now colloquially and widely known as the birthplace of flight, at the time, it was a small, deserted and somewhat treacherous place. But that‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs not a vacation they‚Äôre looking for. Once the location was established, the brothers needed to complete the glider they would use and transport it from Dayton to Kitty Hawk, nearly 700 miles. They built a full size glider with a wingspan of 18 feet, and a cost of $15, which they planned to reassemble at Kitty Hawk. Kitty Hawk was very remote at the time. No bridge access was available, thus access was only via a ferry or a boat. They end up taking a little skiff that is in such bad shape they have to bail water the entire time to stay afloat. When the brothers did finally arrive, they found a small village of about 50 houses, nearly all belonging to fishermen. \"I have my machine nearly finished. It does not have a motor and is not expected to fly in any true sense of the word. My idea is merely to experiment and practice with a view of solving the problem of equilibrium. I have plans which I hope to find much in advance with the methods tried by previous experimenters. Once a machine is under proper control under all conditions, the motor problem will be quickly solved. A failure of a motor will then mean simply a slow descent and safe landing instead of a disastrous fall.\" So that is actually something the brothers thought about a lot, was risk mitigation. Aside from not wanting to die, they realized that Lilenthal had only been in the air for five hours before he died. And so Wilbur says quote, \"the man who wishes to keep at the problem long enough to really learn anything positive must not take dangerous risks. Carelessness and overconfidence are usually more dangerous than deliberately accepted risks.‚Äù Of course some risks were necessary, and they would have crashes, but they were no daredevils out to perform stunts and they never would be. So this first summer they are at first flying what is essentially a manned kite. And they‚Äôre not flying it very high. They‚Äôre just letting the wind lift them about 20 feet off the ground and then trying to control the machine in various ways.

In the first week they Wright Brothers (Part 1): spend they take the machine out on three days for 2-4 hours at a time. So within the first week they have spent more time in the air than Lilenthal did in five years. That should tell you how different their approach was from Lilenthal and frankly from everyone else who was more like Lilenthal. And this whole time, they‚Äôre roughing it. First they stay in a spare room of a local, and then they move out into a tent. They subsist on eggs, tomatoes, and hot biscuits which they can get from the locals. It certainly wasn‚Äôt very comfortable but Orville would say that it was the happiest time they had ever known. And you can imagine why. Just you and the boys camping out on the beach and figuring out how to fly. It doesn‚Äôt sound too bad. And when they‚Äôre not flying, they are taking flying lessons from the birds. One of the locals John T Daniels later recounted ‚ÄúWe couldn't help thinking they were just a pair of poor nuts. They'd stand on the beach for hours at a time just looking at the gulls flying, soaring, dipping. They would watch them and imitate the movements of their wings with their arms and hands. They could imitate every movement of the wing. We thought they were crazy. But we just had to admire the way they could move their arms this way and that and bend their elbows and wrist bones up and down just like the birds.‚Äù But of course, they are seeing their mechanical work as well, John T. Daniels also wrote that the Wright Brothers were quote ‚Äútwo of the workingest boys, and when they worked, they worked. They had their whole heart and soul in what they were doing.‚Äù So finally toward the end of their trip, which was only about a month long, they do some gliding off of some Sand Dunes at an area called Kill Devil Hills. The glides go between 300 and 400 feet and reach speeds of up to 30 miles per hour. Overall it‚Äôs a success, they get some valuable data, have a good time, and find out a lot about their current machine and how it can be improved. And then at the end of October they go back to Dayton to man the bike shop. And this is their routine for the next few years. They spend a couple months in summer or fall in Kitty Hawk, and then return to Dayton to man the bike shop. The next year in 1901, they return to Kitty Hawk again.

The next year in 1901 , they return to Kitty Hawk again . This Wright Brothers (Part 1): time they are immediately met by a scourge of biblical proportions. A swarm of mosquitoes so thick it can practically blot out the sun. Orville said that the agonies of typhoid fever were as nothing compared to the mosquitoes. He said ‚ÄúThe sand and grass and trees and hills and everything was fairly covered with them. They chewed us clear through our underwear and socks. Lumps began swelling up all over my body like hen's eggs. We attempted to escape by going to bed, which we did a little after five o'clock. We put our cots out under the awnings and wrapped up in blankets, with only our noses protruding from the folds, thus exposing the least possible surface to attack. But then he explains that it was so hot that they would get overheated and take off the blankets, but as soon as they did the mosquitoes would swarm and attack and then they would have to retreat under the blankets again. It sounds horrible. Well luckily for the Wright Brothers, the mosquitoes soon dissipated to more normal levels. Now the brothers started thinking a little more longterm, and they build a large shed that served as a combination house, workshop, and hangar. Now, in the off-season of 1900 to 1901, they had spent considerable time looking over the data from Langley and this other guy Chanute, and had modified their glider to fit the best practices laid out by those other flyers. Well as soon as they start flying in 1901, they realize something is seriously wrong with their glider. And over the course of a few days they come to realize that the data provided to them is useless at best. These guys just hadn‚Äôt spent enough time in the air to truly test what worked best. Specifically, they had altered the curvature of their wings to conform to what Lilienthal, Langley, and Chanute had said worked. And it was just wrong. So they had to spend time fixing the wings to bring the wings closer to what they had started with in 1900. This was not an easy fix, Kitty Hawk was not an easy place to make these changes, and it was very disspriting to realize that they had gone backwards not forward, in their time between the two trips to Kitty Hawk. They came close to despair, with Wilbur at one point proclaiming ‚Äúnot in a thousand years would man ever fly.‚Äù At least that is according to Orville.

{"text": "Jesus: Hello and welcome to How to How to Take Over the World. Jesus of Nazareth is the most influential person of all time. There are 2.2 billion Christians in the world currently, representing about a third of the world‚Äôs population. There is no one on earth, outside of a few random uncontacted tribes, who does not know who Jesus is. And that seems normal to us. Christianity has been around for 2,000 years. But forget what you know. How remarkable is it that this occurred from a man who never traveled more than 150 miles from home in his adult life. Someone with no formal higher education. Someone who died before he was my age. I want you to imagine that you time travel to the year 4,000, okay 2,000 years from now. And you are looking around at the flying cars and you manage to talk to someone who explains what the world is like. And you find out that 10 billion people, a third of the world‚Äôs population follow the teachings of someone named Pierre. He was born in a small coastal town near Paris and he never left Spain. He only had a few hundred followers when he died but now his religion is the largest on earth. How desperate would you be to know what it was about this person and his teachings that led to this situation? So that is what we‚Äôre going to look at today. I‚Äôm not coming at this from a Christian perspective, I‚Äôm not going to try to convince you to believe in Jesus. I am just trying to take a look at the historical Jesus and what it was that has led him to take over the world. Having said that, I am going to be using the four gospels, the books of Matthew Mark Luke and John, to analyze his life. They aren‚Äôt historical documents. They certainly are not correct in every minute detail. But for one thing, the Jesus as presented in the gospels is the one who took over the world. So that is who we want to understand. If non-Christians are correct that he was just a man and that the miracles attested to in the Bible are either exaggerations or fabrications, then it‚Äôs still the Jesus of the Bible who we want to understand. Even if he is more literary character than historical person, it is that character who captured the world‚Äôs imagination. And secondly, there are a lot of reasons to believe that the gospels are correct at least in the broad details of Jesus‚Äôs life.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/jesus", "title": "Jesus", "chunk_index": 0, "publication_date": "2024-09-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 29}}
{"text": "if he is more literary character than historical person , it is that character who captured the world ‚Äô s imagination . And secondly , there are a lot of reasons to believe that the gospels are correct at least in the broad details of Jesus ‚Äô s life . Jesus: There is one school of thought that suggests that the gospels were written by people who were by people who were fifteen degrees of contact removed from Jesus and have no relation to the truth whatsoever. But I just don‚Äôt find that reasoning very compelling. People have a number of biases. And the gospel writers certainly had biases, these were not objective historians trying to write a non-biased account, obviously. But one bias people have is for the truth. Even when they are biased and have other motivations, people prefer to tell the truth where possible. The truth is always cleaner, simpler, and more easy to explain than lies. And in addition, you can see the writers of the gospels trying to wrestle with and explain inconvenient historical facts. If the gospel accounts of Jesus‚Äôs life have no relationship to his actual historical life whatsoever, then why do they include these facts? I‚Äôll give one example. The virgin birth. The new testament scholar NT Wright writes The Matthean birth story describes how a Galilean virgin named Mary, though pledged to Joseph, became pregnant ‚Äòthrough the holy spirit‚Äô. Joseph was planning to set aside the marriage privately, on suspicion of infidelity, until an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and told him that ‚Äòwhat is conceived in her is from the holy spirit‚Äô. Matthew adds an editorial remark that Jesus‚Äô birth fulfils the words of Isaiah 7.14 about the virgin bearing a child who is to be called ‚ÄòImmanuel‚Äô, which means ‚ÄòGod with us‚Äô (1.18‚Äì23). This is the more interesting in that we know of no pre-Christian readers of Isaiah who took the passage in this way. It seems far more likely that the story of Jesus‚Äô extraordinary conception generated a search for relevant texts rather than (as has often been suggested) the other way round. So in other words, even if you take the non-Biblical view, which I think most of my listeners do, even if you think the virgin birth is a fabrication, it seems more likely that the virgin birth is trying to explain some dispute about Jesus‚Äôs heritage, most likely that Jesus‚Äôs mother indeed became pregnant before she was married, rather than a story created to match an ancient prophecy. Now that is not to say that everything in the Bible is historically accurate, I‚Äôll talk about a couple of things that are questionable, but that was my long way of saying, I think the Jesus of the Bible does have some relationship to the historical", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/jesus", "title": "Jesus", "chunk_index": 1, "publication_date": "2024-09-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 29}}

A Biography From A Believer by Paul Johnson The New Testament In Its World by NT Wright And lastly of course The New Testament (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) - I used the King James Version I should mention that I was able to listen to the New Testament in my own voice, which was pretty cool. There is an old Jewish tradition that God speaks to you in your own voice, so if you have ever for example watched The Prince of Egypt, Val Kilmer voices Moses, and he also voices God.

Why? Essentially because of Roman conquest. Under the great king David, Israel is established as an independent kingdom and a regional Power. David‚Äôs son, Solomon, builds a beautiful temple that becomes the center, the beating heart, of Jewish worship. But then they are conquered by the Babylonians who destroy their temple and take the people into captivity. The Babylonians are overthrown by the Persians, who allow them to return to Jerusalem and rebuild their temple. The temple is rebuilt, but then the Jews get new rulers when the Persians are overthrown by Alexander the Great. Efforts are made by some of Alexander‚Äôs successors to Hellenize the Jews, essentially bring them into conformity with Greek culture. The temple is taken and rededicated to Zeus, and pigs are sacrificed to him, which was a normal sacrifice by Greek standards, but pigs were unclean to Jews and this was highly offensive. Eventually, the Jews revolt under the leadership of Mattathias Maccabee and his five sons and win independence from this Greek kingdom. But it‚Äôs not very long lasting independence because they are soon once again conquered, this time by the Romans. The Romans are not as repressive as the Babylonians, but neither are they as hands-off as the Persians. Most offensively, Pompey the Great, the contemporary of Julius", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/jesus", "title": "Jesus", "chunk_index": 2, "publication_date": "2024-09-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 29}}
{"text": "long lasting independence because they are soon once again conquered , this time by the Romans . The Romans are not as repressive as the Babylonians , but neither are they as hands - off as the Persians . Most offensively , Pompey the Great , the contemporary of Julius Jesus: Caesar‚Äôs who conquers Judea, goes into the holy of holies, which was the most sacred part of the temple, the most sacred place in the world according to Jewish worship. He leaves the temple in tact, but entering the holy of holies was an act of defilement according to the Jews. Now the Romans often liked to rule places via client kings. In other words, you guys can keep your king, we don‚Äôt want to deal with your little squabbles, but that king reports to us. So they had a client king named Herod, who came to be known as Herod the Great, and he had a good relationship with the Romans. Culturally, he was pretty well Hellenized, I don‚Äôt think you would call him a sincere Jewish believer by any stretch of the imagination, but he had a lot of Jewish support because he renovated the second temple and greatly expanded it. So the Jews have their temple, they are allowed to worship in it, but they still resent Roman dominance over them. They want their independence. There were a thousand ways in which Roman rule bothered them. Some were big things, for example a Roman eagle stood at the entrance to the temple, letting the Jews know who was really in charge here. And some in small ways. In The New Testament in Its World, NT Wright highlights a story that I find hilarious about one religious riot in Jerusalem shortly after the life of Jesus. Listen to this. This is from the ancient historian Josephus: The Matthean birth story describes how a Galilean virgin named Mary, though pledged to Joseph, became pregnant ‚Äòthrough the holy spirit‚Äô. Joseph was planning to set aside the marriage privately, on suspicion of infidelity, until an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and told him that ‚Äòwhat is conceived in her is from the holy spirit‚Äô.

{"text": "generated a search for relevant texts rather than ( as has often been suggested ) the other way round . Okay so a riot that ends up leading to thirty thousand dead starts because a Roman soldier moons the crowd and farts at them . So that is the kind Jesus: of stuff that upset the Jews and made them yearn for a time when they would be free from Roman rule. I think there is just also a feeling of complete disruption. You are used to a certain way of life, and then the Romans completely upset it, bringing wealth and trade and new goods and new people. But then you can‚Äôt help but feel inferior to these people who have totally upended your world. Paul Johnson has a good summary: ‚ÄúTHE WORLD INTO WHICH Jesus was born was harsh, cruel, violent, and unstable. It was also materialistic and increasingly wealthy. The great fact of geopolitics was Rome and its possessions, in the process of transforming itself from a republic into an empire. It now occupied the shores of the entire Mediterranean, from which one of its great men, Pompey, had driven all the pirates which once infested it, using ruthless methods of brutality, torture, and large-scale public executions. As a result, trade was expanding fast and many cities and individuals doubled their riches in the generation before Jesus was born.‚Äù And look I think there is some element of jealousy from religious leaders. Likes yes, the Romans are making things better in a lot of ways, but in so doing they are perhaps disrupting traditional ways of life in Judea and threatening the religious authorities‚Äô hold on power. I mean listen to Paul Johnson‚Äôs description of Herod the Great, the client king who was ruling Judea under the Romans: In what we now call Palestine, a similar calm prevailed at the time of Jesus‚Äôs birth, under the plutocratic tyranny of Herod the Great. For more than thirty years, this astute financier, who had made himself the richest individual in the entire empire, had by his subservience to the rulers of Rome (and by princely gifts) made himself master of the ancient kingdom of the Jews. He was the greatest builder of his age, creating a new port at Caesarea in Samaria, rebuilding and enlarging the Temple in Jerusalem, and building public baths, aqueducts, and what we would call shopping centers in half a dozen cities, as well as a ring of powerful fortresses, including the massive Antonia (named after Mark Antony) in Jerusalem, overlooking the Temple and his own enormous palace. He was a benefactor of the Jews on a colossal scale. But he was not popular among them. Only half Jewish by birth, and wholly Greek in his cultural tastes, he was regarded as heretical by the Jewish religious authorities for sponsoring Greek-style games, theaters, and music. He also", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/jesus", "title": "Jesus", "chunk_index": 4, "publication_date": "2024-09-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 29}}
{"text": "a colossal scale . But he was not popular among them . Only half Jewish by birth , and wholly Greek in his cultural tastes , he was regarded as heretical by the Jewish religious authorities for sponsoring Greek - style games , theaters , and music . He also Jesus: had numerous wives and concubines, some of them Gentiles, and sired many children. Suspicious and cruel, he slaughtered over forty of his wives, children, and close relatives, often in circumstances of peculiar atrocity, for conspiracies, real or imaginary, against his rule and person. As his reign drew to a close‚Äîthe last year of his life was the year of Jesus‚Äôs birth‚Äîhis suspicions increased, and an atmosphere of paranoia prevailed at his court. Okay so obviously it‚Äôs a very beautiful and prosperous nation that he is creating but from a religious perspective the question is at what cost? For religious leaders and highly pious people, this prosperity is no boon at all, but a threat to their way of life. This hellenistic setting formed a perpetual cultural and religious threat to the Jews, every bit as powerful as any political danger. The self-understanding of Jews at this time was determined by the pressing question of whether they should attempt to be distinct from this alien culture, and if so, how. Pressure to assimilate was strong in many quarters, especially in places outside Palestine like Egypt and Asia Minor (modern Turkey). Many Jews attempted to assimilate to hellenistic culture in various ways, ranging from token participation in Greek civic life all the way through to apostasy from Judaism. I think Judaism at the turn of the millennium was in a similar place that Christianity is in right now. It‚Äôs sort of obviously in decline and in need of reform. But the question is what direction will that reform take? There are the rainbow flag denominations trying to take it in a more liberal direction, and then you have the rise of consciously reactionary Christian movements too. So the question is does Judaism adapt or resist? Herod and the Sadducees represented those who wanted to adapt. For those who want to resist, the Pharisees, the messiah is their great hope. The messiah was the one who would overthrow Roman rule, set up an independent Jewish religious kingdom and usher in a golden age of righteousness and freedom. So you have all of these movements that are preparing for the messiah and Israel‚Äôs restoration. One of the big ones are the Pharisees. They want to prepare the people. Make them holy in preparation for the coming of the Lord. They think okay, the reason that the messiah hasn‚Äôt come to free us yet is because we aren‚Äôt righteous enough. And so they are very intense about helping people observe the minutiae of every Mosaic law to assure that everyone is in constant compliance with religious rules and protocol.s", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/jesus", "title": "Jesus", "chunk_index": 5, "publication_date": "2024-09-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 29}}

And so they are very intense about helping people observe the minutiae of every Mosaic law to assure that everyone is in constant compliance with religious rules and protocol . s Jesus: This is where Rabbinic Judaism comes from. Judaism used to be less hardcore about their rules before the Pharisaic movement. Okay the Pharisees are not the only Jews who are waiting and looking for a messiah, but they are the most prominent sect that takes this attitude, and they are the most relevant to our story. So this is the world that Jesus is born into. He comes into the Jewish world at a time when many have a burning expectation of the imminent arrival of a messiah, a savior who will free Israel from their Roman oppressors. ‚Äç Early Life Jesus is of course born around 0 AD. I think many historians now place his birth a little before, maybe 4 BC. But it‚Äôs impossible to know with certainty. But he was born sometime around the year 0. According to the Bible, it is a miraculous conception to a virgin mother. As previously discussed. Also according to the Bible he was born in Bethlehem. Everyone agrees that Jesus was from a small town called Nazareth. According to the book of Luke however, ‚ÄúAnd it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.‚Äù And so there is a census of the Roman empire that requires everyone to travel to their ancestral homeland to be counted. So since Jesus‚Äôs father was a descendant of King David, the family had to travel to Bethlehem, where Jesus was born in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn. You know the story. Now it turns out, there are no records for a Roman census at the time of Jesus‚Äôs birth. The account of Luke is probably referring to the census of Quirinius which was a few years after Jesus‚Äôs birth. So I mean who knows, the point of this episode is not to point out every evidence for and against the new testament. Just for the sake of showing both sides honesty I‚Äôm pointing out that the popular account of Jesus‚Äôs birth does appear to have some inconsistencies. not only should they be taxed but they needed to travel to their ancestral homeland to be counted. This is the only time I‚Äôm going to comment on the historicity of the Bible. And I don‚Äôt think these accusations are particularly damning toward the overall veracity of the new testament. If you‚Äôre a believer, I wouldn‚Äôt let this upset you. I‚Äôm just saying that if you‚Äôre looking at this from a purely historical perspective of what do we know about this", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/jesus", "title": "Jesus", "chunk_index": 6, "publication_date": "2024-09-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 29}}

I ‚Äô m just saying that if you ‚Äô re looking at this from a purely historical perspective of what do we know about this Jesus: person? You‚Äôre likely to conclude that he was simply a young man from Nazareth. So according to the Bible Jesus‚Äôs family makes a quick detour to Egypt, which we won‚Äôt get into it. That may or may not be true. But Nazareth is definitely where Jesus grew up. Nazareth is a small town in the region of the Sea of Galilee. It‚Äôs a few days walk from Jerusalem. It had a population of a few hundred. It was a small town. It was not well regarded. In fact, there is a story in the book of John that a man Philip finds Jesus and follows him and goes to tell his brother Nathanael and says ‚ÄúWe have found him, of whom MOses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.‚Äù And the brother responds ‚ÄúCan there any good thing come out of Nazareth?‚Äù Okay, so Nazareth is like, I don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt want to offend anyone. It‚Äôs like Mississippi in the American context. Apologies to any of my listeners from Mississippi I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs actually great. Just like Nazareth. But I don‚Äôt want you to think of Jesus entirely as a country bumpkin. The only story we know from Jesus‚Äôs childhood comes from when he is twelve years old. His family travels to Jerusalem to worship at the temple. ANd on the return journey, his parents look around and discover to their horror that Jesus is not with the group. So in a frenzy they turn around and go back to the temple where they find him in the temple deep in discussion with the elders, who of course amazed by the boy‚Äôs precocious wisdom. And he responds ‚ÄúHow is it that ye sought me? Wist ye not that I must be about my Father‚Äôs business?‚Äù And this shows the connectedness of the Jewish world. And the education. Paul Johnson writes: ‚ÄúWe can be sure he was well instructed. Virtually all clever Jewish children were, if circumstances permitted, and Jesus came from a comfortable home. We know he could read, for his deep and, still more, his skeptical knowledge of the scriptures is evidence of constant study of the texts from an early age. By age twelve he was perfectly capable of taking part in a learned discussion of their meaning.‚Äù We basically miss Jesus‚Äôs young adulthood. We know nothing about it from the time he is twelve until he is 30 years old.

{"text": ". By age twelve he was perfectly capable of taking part in a learned discussion of their meaning . ‚Äù We basically miss Jesus ‚Äô s young adulthood . We know nothing about it from the time he is twelve until he is 30 years old . Paul Johnson suggests Jesus: he had no job and worked in agriculture. I think he just as easily could have followed his father‚Äôs trade and been a carpenter. In either case, judging by the types of stories he would eventually tell, he was a keen observer of the world around him. Who knows. We literally know nothing about it. No religious texts. No historical texts. Just a total black box. ‚Äç Early Years Ministry and John the Baptist (Inauguration) ‚Äç The narrative now moves to John the Baptist. He is a preacher. He‚Äôs a part of this popular wave of people saying that Israel needs to get ready for the return of the messiah. Many think that he is the messiah. He‚Äôs very popular, and his big thing seems to be baptism. John did not invent baptism. In the Jewish context of the early first century, baptism would have been seen as a ritual washing. But John‚Äôs innovation seems to have been to tie it to the idea of repentance. So not just purifying yourself from contamination, but from your own sinfulness. Now John is the cousin of Jesus. So they have a preexisting family connection. The most famous story about John is when he baptizes Jesus. And according to all of the Biblical accounts, this is accompanied by a miraculous display of God‚Äôs approval of Jesus. And that is really where Jesus‚Äôs story begins. Then he goes off into the wilderness for forty days where he is tempted by the devil but he overcomes it. He is tempted with worldly power. The implication is that he could have become the messiah that everyone expected: The one who would throw off the shackles of Roman rule and bring forth an independent Israel. But instead he chooses the higher mission given to him by God. Which will become clear as the story goes on. Interestingly in this inauguration period there is no moment of him finding out about his calling. He alludes to it during the incident at the temple, I think the implication is that he somehow always knew his mission or else was taught it by his mother at a young age. So according to Matthew, the first thing Jesus does is the same thing as John the Baptist. Matthew: ‚ÄúFrom that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.‚Äù Make a point about zeal. There is always someone who comes before you. And certainly Jesus would point to God as that primary example he was emulating, but in a strictly mortal sense, John is that person who he emulates", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/jesus", "title": "Jesus", "chunk_index": 8, "publication_date": "2024-09-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 29}}
{"text": "heaven is at hand . ‚Äù Make a point about zeal . There is always someone who comes before you . And certainly Jesus would point to God as that primary example he was emulating , but in a strictly mortal sense , John is that person who he emulates Jesus: and then surpasses. Now according to Matthew it is once John is thrown into prison that Jesus returns to Galilee and begins to preach. And according to Matthew the first thing he does is call disciples. Peter, Andrew, James, and John. The timelines on the four gospels don‚Äôt actually match up exactly. Which again is the sort of thing that you would expect from first hand accounts of people who were not writing down things as they happened but writing down remembrances later. But the general timeline is the same that he starts preaching, performing miracles, and calling disciples. When Jesus says the kingdom of heaven is at hand, he means a specific thing by that. I think most people would have interpreted it as a return of independent Israel under divine guidance. Of course what Christians think he meant was a spiritual kingdom administered through his church. So like the pharisees, Jesus is calling people to live a more obedient life in preparation for the coming of this kingdom of heaven. But unlike them his emphasis will be on adherence to the deeper meaning of the commandments, rather than strict obedience to the specific Mosaic rituals. Stuff like counting your steps on the sabbath day and rituals around eating and washing and all of that. But most of that is yet to come, it seems that early on, Jesus‚Äôs message is simply repent. Do better. ‚Äç Miracles ‚Äç According to the synoptic gospels, Jesus‚Äôs first miracles are healings. Matthew says he went around ‚Äúhealing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.‚Äù and also exorcisms. According to John the first miracle was turning water into wine. And this is widely regarded as his first miracle. So I‚Äôll just read from the book of John, it describes the miracle: 2 And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to [a] marriage. 3 And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine. 4 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come. 5 His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it. 6 And there were set there six waterpots of stone 7 Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. 8 And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it. 9 [And] the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/jesus", "title": "Jesus", "chunk_index": 9, "publication_date": "2024-09-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 29}}
{"text": "to the brim . 8 And he saith unto them , Draw out now , and bear unto the governor of the feast . And they bare it . 9 [ And ] the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine , and knew not Jesus: whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, ‚Äç Now one of the most interesting things about Jesus is he likes to party. He likes to have dinner with his friends, he likes to eat and drink with his disciples and followers and everyone really. The Pharisees especially look askance at the company he keeps. ‚ÄúHe was a convivial and collegiate spirit, always seeking companions and new friends.‚Äù He actually uses that word, convivial, many times. And I think it‚Äôs a good one. He was convivial. In fact, the Matthew takes time to make an apology for Jesus‚Äôs habit 14 Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not? His answer is that basically I‚Äôm here. The Messiah is here, it‚Äôs time to celebrate. And one of my favorite facts about the miracle of the water to wine is that the wine is really good. So as I was saying earlier, the governor of the feast tries the wine, and this is his response: 9 When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the [groom], 10 And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now. In other words, wow, usually people put out the good wine first, and then bring out the worse wine later, I guess they‚Äôre hoping you won‚Äôt notice because you‚Äôre a little tipsy at this point. But, the governor says, you saved the best wine for last. This is great wine. So Jesus doesn‚Äôt just turn water into wine. He turns it into really good wine! And obviously I find that pretty funny, but I also think it says something about Jesus. How much conviviality mattered to him. I also think it demonstrates part of why he was able to gain followers. Yes, the miracles. Yes his revolutionary teachings. But also the lifestyle that he offered. If you wanted to be crass you would say that Jesus and his disciples basically were unemployed bros who went around just hanging out, discussing interesting philosophy, and drinking.

{"text": "he offered . If you wanted to be crass you would say that Jesus and his disciples basically were unemployed bros who went around just hanging out , discussing interesting philosophy , and drinking . I don ‚Äô t think they were alcoholics but I do think that the lifestyle Jesus put forward of radical freedom and a relaxed, convivial, environment was really attractive. If you want to start a movement like Jesus did. You look at startups, and businesses which are built around helping people do what they SHOULD do fail all the time. But businesses that offer people what they want to do succeed. Okay Weightwatchers has a marketcap of 65 million dollars. McDonalds has a market cap of 210 billion dollars. And I think the same thing is true of movements. A lot of the political movements and social movements today are all about things that you SHOULD do. I see this in politics. On the right wing a lot of the messaging to young men is you should step up. Get a job. Be responsible. Instead of offering something compelling in terms of an attractive way of life. Same thing on the left. A lot of talk about checking your privilege and trying to browbeat people into going along with your program through guilt. And look of course you also need to challenge your followers. Jesus did both as we shall see. But I think Jesus‚Äôs lifestyle of detached free-spirited living combined with conviviality and sociability created a very compelling social dynamic and I think that helps to explain some of his success. I also think one of the other reasons that Jesus was so focused on eating and drinking is that meals are a uniquely good setting for teaching. ‚ÄúJesus loved conviviality and he never condemned generous hospitality. Many of his most telling lessons were taught around crowded tables.‚Äù Last year I went down and visited Bryan Johnson who you may have seen in the news recently, Mr Don‚Äôt Die. And to introduce his philosophy and his vision, he invited me and about 10 other people to a dinner at his house. And it was a very special experience. If you are trying to start a movement I think dinners are a uniquely powerful way to do that. Well, okay, back in the life of Jesus, it‚Äôs not just turning water into wine. He‚Äôs also healing. He‚Äôs about to give his first big sermon and lay out his doctrine. But I think it‚Äôs crucial that he does miracles first. Sometimes you hear in storytelling the principle show don‚Äôt tell. And Jesus is going to tell people what he believes and what he‚Äôs all about but first he shows them by performing these miracles. ‚Äç The Sermon on the Mount ‚Äç And then yes, he does tell people what he believes.

He sets out his program . His moral framework at an event that has Jesus: come to be known as the sermon on the mount. It‚Äôs the most famous sermon ever. You have almost certainly heard some of it. For example. Some of the most famous teachings are: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. for they shall be comforted. for they shall inherit the earth. and 14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. 15 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. 16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. And 27 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: 28 But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. and 38 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: 39 But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. And 43 Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. 44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; And of course the Lord‚Äôs prayer where he teaches his disciples to pray: 5 ¬∂ And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. 7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.

Thy will be done in earth , as it is in heaven . 11 Give us this day our daily bread . 12 And forgive Jesus: us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. 13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen. So many of these teachings might strike us as banal. But at the time they were utterly revolutionary. It was a complete inversion of the moral order. It is the ultimate inversion. The lowly and meek who love God are the good. Power, wealth, health, beauty, and strength are seen with inherent skepticism. Or at least that is how the sermon on the mount has been popularly understood. He teaches a way of forgiveness, non-aggression, detachment, and love. 28 And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine 29 For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes. And I think this is a major secret of Jesus‚Äôs success. He does quote the Torah from time to time. But he doesn‚Äôt rest his authority on scripture. If he had, there are always people who can second guess and contradict you. Rather, he unveiled the truth like Steve Jobs pulling the curtain off the Macintosh. Behold! Here it is! The teachings contained their own justification. They were so beautiful and elegant that they needed no complex proofs. No multi-step historical reasoning. Just, here they are. Aren‚Äôt they great? ‚Äç Miracles (continued) ‚Äç Well after his sermon on the mount, his miracles kick into overdrive. He cures a leper, he stills a storm, he casts out devils. He actually gets into trouble because in one instance, a man has a number of devils that are possessing him, and he casts them out into a herd of pigs, and the newly possessed pigs go running off a cliff into the sea, killing themselves, and the locals are not impressed by his power, but rather furious that he has killed their livestock and they chase him out of town. He heals paralytics, raises people from the dead, and causes the blind to see. All of this makes him a major celebrity, and everywhere he goes, he has throngs of people following him. Some hoping to be healed, many just wanting to hear the words of this new and exciting prophet. ‚Äç Disciples ‚Äç This celebrity means that he has to steal away at times to either be alone or to be with his inner circle of disciples who would become known as the twelve apostles.

{"text": "words of this new and exciting prophet . ‚Äç Disciples ‚Äç This celebrity means that he has to steal away at times to either be alone or to be with his inner circle of disciples who would become known as the twelve apostles . Now I mentioned before that he Jesus: offers a compelling way of life. But it‚Äôs not all giveaways. He‚Äôs also very demanding of his closest followers. He demands absolute devotion. And incredible sacrifice. So for example, in one instance, one man wants to follow him, but he says: ‚ÄúLord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. 22 But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead. Great leaders are demanding. Especially of their closest followers. So for example, when Jesus calls his inner circle, his twelve apostles, here is the commission he gives them: 7 And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. 8 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give. 9 Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses, 10 Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: Okay, so in other words, you need to go preach with nothing. No money, no extra coat, no tent, nothing. And he warns them: 16 Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves. for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues; 18 And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles. So go teach people, do it totally impoverished. Take nothing with you. And by the way, you‚Äôre going to be persecuted and prosecuted as criminals for doing so. He is really pushing these people. In another passage of scripture, a man comes to him and asks 16 ¬∂ ‚ÄúGood Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? 17 And he said unto him, if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. 18 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 20 The young man saith (I‚Äôve done all of this, he says:) All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet? 21 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven:", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/jesus", "title": "Jesus", "chunk_index": 14, "publication_date": "2024-09-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 29}}
{"text": ") All these things have I kept from my youth up : what lack I yet ? 21 Jesus said unto him , If thou wilt be perfect , go and sell that thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : Jesus: and come and follow me. 22 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions. Okay, so Jesus has this demand that you must be willing to sacrifice everything to be my follower. I think this is most memorably expressed in the following passage: ‚ÄúAnd there went great multitudes with Jesus: And he turned and said unto them: If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.‚Äù I think that is one thing that is missing from those who try to portray Jesus as a peace-loving hippy. The radicalism. In another passage he says ‚ÄúI am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.‚Äù Again we are so used to this stuff that it might strike us as unremarkable. But imagine Caesar or Napoleon saying this. I am the way and the truth and the life. I think actually my favorite depiction of this quote is not from a depiction of Jesus at all, but from the book Dune. The main character is a messiah figure who is reminiscent of both Jesus and Mohammed in different ways. But he is given the nickname Muadib, which means the one who points the way and in the climactic scene in the movie Dune 2 he shouts to the people ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pointing the way.‚Äù and it‚Äôs played as a moment of horror. I obviously don‚Äôt see Jesus in such cynical terms but it would have been equally shocking to a person in 30 something AD listening to this message. I am the way. You must hate your father and mother and wife and children and follow me. ‚Äç Disputations ‚Äç Well Jesus is getting big enough now that he begins to attract the attention (and disapproval) of the Pharisees. This is competitive jealousy more than anything. They are both concerned about his unorthodox teaching and threatened by his popularity. It‚Äôs interesting that there are relatively few examples of him arguing with the Sadducees, at least until his trial at the end of his life (spoiler alert) but he argues with those who might be able to be convinced. And the Jesus movement has to go somewhat underground for a bit. 14 ¬∂ Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him. 15 But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/jesus", "title": "Jesus", "chunk_index": 15, "publication_date": "2024-09-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 29}}

And I think that is another lesson for those trying to start a movement. Certain things, your most radical teachings, you need to keep secret, at least until the appropriate time. ‚Äç Parables ‚Äç I don‚Äôt know whether it‚Äôs connected or not, but from this time period on is when Jesus begins to teach even more in a style for which he was well known: Parables. A parable is a simple story used to illustrate a moral or spiritual lesson. So for example, probably his two most famous parables are the prodigal son and the good samaritan. The good samaritan is given in response to a line of inquiries, a lawyer, presumably a Pharisee, asks Jesus what he shall do to have eternal life. And Jesus answers him saying ‚ÄúThou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and they neighbor as thyself. And so the lawyer asks him well who is my neighbor? And in response Jesus tells him a story, which we now know as the parable of the good samaritan. So a certain man is traveling on a road when he is attacked by thieves who strip him of his goods, his clothes, then they wound him, and leave him for dead. And a priest passes by him on the road, and then another priest. And both of them pass by the other side of the road. But then a Samaritan passes by. And Samaritans were old ethnic enemies of the Jews. Or at least ethnic rivals. They were looked down on by well-bred Jews, they were considered half-breeds. There was a lot of bad blood between the Jews and the Samaritans. But this Samaritan takes compassion on the man. And here is what he does. Reading now from Luke 10: 33 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him, 34 And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. 35 And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/jesus", "title": "Jesus", "chunk_index": 16, "publication_date": "2024-09-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 29}}
{"text": "care of him . 35 And on the morrow when he departed , he took out two pence , and gave them to the host , and said unto him , Take care of him ; and whatsoever thou spendest more , when I come again , I will repay Jesus: thee. 36 Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves? 37 And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise. Alright and then one of my other favorite parables is the prodigal son. So the Pharisees ask why he associates with the people he does. Specifically he often dines with known sinners, and with publicans. Publicans were Roman tax collectors. Rome actually didn‚Äôt have a public tax collection apparatus for their provinces so they would essentially bid out the service to a wealthy senator. And at first this is a very profitable affair but quickly the price to administer one of these provinces skyrockets. And what that means is that many senators take a loss on the contract. And if you‚Äôre not going to take a loss, you had better squeeze this province for everything they have got. So these private tax collectors were called publicani, publicans. And they were hated because they really had this pressure to bleed you dry in places like Judea in order to make back the money that they had spent to get this contract. Okay and Jesus has no qualms about associating with publicani. It should be noted that most of the rank and file publicani, these are just employees, these aren‚Äôt the people making the rules, they didn‚Äôt buy this contract at exorbitant prices. They‚Äôre just contractors who are trying to make a living. But they are totally hated in the provinces. And also it strikes me that he is dining with people who are hated in sort of opposite directions. The sinners because they are low. These are people of ill-repute. Usually poor. The detritus of society. And the publicans because they are high. Because they oppress. Because they refuse to acknowledge their privilege. They are RAYCISS. So in modern terms basically he‚Äôs dining with the worst stereotype of both sides. With the inner city welfare queens and the MAGA racists. And so, reading now from Luke 15 ‚Äúthe Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, this man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.‚Äù And in response he gives a few parables to explain why he goes out of his way to teach and associate with these segments of society. And the final parable is now known as the parable of the prodigal son. A certain wealthy man has two sons. And the younger son asks for his portion of the inheritance. So the dad gives it to him.

And he goes into a foreign country and wastes the money Jesus: on riotous living. Presumably sex drugs and rock and roll. But there is a famine in this foreign land and the son runs out of money. And he ends up with a job feeding pigs and he doesn‚Äôt even have enough money to eat. ‚ÄúHow many hired servants of my father‚Äôs have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants. 20 And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. 21 And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son. 22 But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: 23 And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry: 24 For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry. and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing. 26 And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant. 27 And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound. 28 And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and entreated him. 29 And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends: 30 But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf. 31 And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine. 32 It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.

{"text": "with me , and all that I have is thine . 32 It was meet that we should make merry , and be glad : for this thy brother was dead , and is alive again ; and was lost , and is found . One of these things that Jesus: great communicators are good at is making comparisons. Parable is just one of the most effective teaching devices there is. Period. And Jesus was a master of it. There are not half a dozen lines of his teaching without an image, and often an unforgettable one, which has entered into the repertoire of writers all over the world. Inanimate objects spring to life, animals are anthropomorphized, nature teems with purposeful moral activity, and human beings often assume a dignity, a profundity, or a pathos, thanks to the brilliant glitter of Jesus‚Äôs imagery. We hear of ‚Äúliving water‚Äù (Jn 4 : 10) and ‚Äúthe blind lead[ing] the blind‚Äù (Lk 6 : 39). Jesus wishes to gather the children of Jerusalem together ‚Äúas a hen doth gather her brood under her wings‚Äù (Lk 13 : 34). There is a wonderful image of the simple farmer who should sow ‚Äúnight and day‚Äù and ‚Äúthe seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how‚Äù (Mk 4:27). Jesus loves single trees, standing in isolation, the olive, the fig, the vine, and uses them tenderly. He speaks of the late summer and the whitening harvests. He loves roots, branches, and leaves, and sees images of people in all of them. You know in response to the question why do you eat with publicans and sinners he could have just said because they are the ones who need it. But these parables illustrate the point so much powerfully. The lessons that he is teaching become iconic and memorable through his creative use of parables. And I think that parables help stimulate others to think for themselves as well. Instead of just hearing and accepting or rejecting a teaching, they turn it over in their mind and really think about it and its implications. ‚Äç John The Baptist Dies (Retirement) ‚Äç John the Baptist has been imprisoned for basically the entirety of Jesus‚Äôs ministry. But now the king of Judea, Herod, executes him. He‚Äôs beheaded. There is a whole story there, he is convinced to do it by a dancing girl, his stepdaughter. Anyway, this is a huge blow for Jesus, who is obviously grief-stricken. And goes out into a desert place to be alone. But the crowd finds out where he is, and they follow him out into the wilderness. Of course, the problem is, how do you feed so many people? You‚Äôre away from the towns and cities where food could be bought. So after Jesus has", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/jesus", "title": "Jesus", "chunk_index": 19, "publication_date": "2024-09-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 29}}
{"text": "crowd finds out where he is , and they follow him out into the wilderness . Of course , the problem is , how do you feed so many people ? You ‚Äô re away from the towns and cities where food could be bought . So after Jesus has Jesus: healed the sick who have come to see him, he takes what little food they have, five loaves of bread and two fishes, and he blesses it, puts it into baskets and tells his disciples to go feed it to the people. Miraculously, the loaves and fishes keep replenishing. And five thousand people are fed. It is after this incident that Jesus walks on water in the midst of a storm, and causes Peter to walk on water for a brief period as well. And then he performs the same feeding miracle again, except this time he feeds four thousand people with seven loaves and a few fishes. ‚Äç Final Preaching in Jerusalem ‚Äç This marks the beginning of Jesus‚Äôs preparation for the end. He now begins to speak more openly to his disciples of who he is. He asks them who people say he is. And then he asks them who they think he is, And his foremost disciple, his sort of #2, Simon Peter answers ‚ÄúThou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.‚Äù Jesus in these last days tends to spend more time teaching his disciples rather than large crowds. It‚Äôs as if he‚Äôs trying to prepare them to be able to carry on the work in his absence, knowing that he will soon die. Along with his followers, Jesus travels from Galilee to Jerusalem. And he is received at first with rapturous acclaim. It is a triumphant entry into Jerusalem. People spread their garments before him so that his mule doesn‚Äôt have to tread on the ground, and they put palm fronds on the path before him. Even so, most of these don‚Äôt think of him as the messiah. When they are asked who this man is, his supporters respond ‚ÄúJesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.‚Äù So he‚Äôs popular with the people. One of the first things he does once he enters Jerusalem is go to the temple. The temple was the center of Jewish worship. It was really the center of their world. It‚Äôs hard to overemphasize how important the temple was. But it was more than that. It was also a symbol of the entire Herodian regime and the Sadducees who supported him. The Temple became, de facto, the cultic shrine organized by those who had made a somewhat unsteady peace with Rome. [he] began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves; 16 And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/jesus", "title": "Jesus", "chunk_index": 20, "publication_date": "2024-09-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 29}}

[ he ] began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers , and the seats of them that sold doves ; 16 And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the Jesus: temple. 17 And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves. 18 And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine. So from this point on, both the pharisees and the sadducees are now going into overdrive thinking about how they can get rid of Jesus. Now they can‚Äôt do this themselves, both because Jesus is still popular with the people, and because they don‚Äôt have the legal authority to execute someone. They are under Roman rule. They can only turn people over to the authorities. So they start looking for pretexts upon which they can recommend charges to the Romans. At first, Jesus cleverly avoids these. In the most famous example, the chief priests asks Jesus whether it is lawful to give tribute unto Caesar or not. This is quite the conundrum because if he says no, he can be turned over to the Romans because he is urging people not to pay their taxes. But if he says yes, he is undermining his radical message. He‚Äôs exposing himself as a toady of the Roman regime. And that would make him very unpopular with the people. So he answers very cleverly. He asks them to pull out a coin. And then he asks them ‚ÄúWhose is the image and the superscription‚Äù on the coin? And they say ‚ÄúCaesar‚Äôs.‚Äù And he says to them ‚ÄúRender therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar‚Äôs, and unto God the things that are God‚Äôs. But these clever responses cannot put off his enemies for long. ‚Äç The Passion The chief priests and the scribes and the elders and the high priests. Basically anyone who can be described as a religious authority in any way shape or form, people who are normally rivals and hate each other, begin getting together and conspiring to remove Jesus. With such powerful enemies, it is only a matter of time for Jesus. One of the last things Jesus does is, appropriately, have a feast with his closest followers. This is the passover, the greatest celebration of the Jewish calendar. So Jesus has a passover feast with his apostles. He predicts that one of them will betray him.

And then Jesus administers a special meal. The last supper. He blesses the bread and wine and tells his apostles to eat it in remembrance of his body and blood, which will soon be sacrificed. Christians all over the world reenact this last supper in a ceremony that is called the eucharist or holy communion, or the blessed sacrament of the lord‚Äôs supper. It‚Äôs now night time, and Jesus leaves the building where they are having this last supper, and goes to an orchard of olive trees to pray. He takes with him Peter James and John, three of his closest apostles. He tells them ‚ÄúMy soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.‚Äù He is in agony, apparently over the sacrifice that he will soon be asked to make. He falls on his face and prays ‚ÄúO my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.‚Äù Peter James and John fall asleep as he prays, and he has to wake them multiple times. He asks them one of the most stinging questions of all time ‚ÄúCould ye not watch with me one hour?‚Äù And finally the last time that they fall asleep he says ‚ÄúSleep now now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.‚Äù At that moment, Judas comes with up the hill with a crowd of chief priests, elders, and ruffians carrying swords and staves. His disciples first try to defend him, and Peter takes out a sword that he had been carrying and cuts off a man‚Äôs ear. According to the book of John, he is first taken to an elder named Annas, who then refers him to the chief priest, Caiphas. The trial is a sham and a miscarriage of justice from the very beginning. The prosecutors are apparently unprepared, and have trouble coming up with witnesses, though they eventually come up with two who are willing to testify that Jesus said he would destroy the temple. And Jesus had indeed prophesied that the temple would be destroyed. Jesus maintains silent dignity in the face of this circus. Only answering the final question.

Jesus had prophesied this would happen, and when Peter realizes what he has done, he goes out and weeps bitterly. The council of high priests then bind Jesus and take him to Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of the region. Pilate is really reluctant to get involved in a Jewish religious squabble. And so he asks him the most relevant question: Are you trying to lead a rebellion. He says quote ‚ÄúArt thou the King of the Jews?‚Äù And Jesus answers ‚ÄúMy kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.‚Äù I‚Äôm condensing here obviously. But this is the key question to Pilate. Are you trying to start a rebellion? Are you really trying to overthrow Roman rule like these chief priests are saying? And Jesus says what he wants to hear, my kingdom is not of this earth. And even gives him evidence, look, my followers are not here armed trying to stop me from being arrested. And this is good enough for Pilate who declares ‚ÄúI find in him no fault at all.‚Äù The mob outside his palace is not happy with this. So Pilate tries to pass the buck and sends him to Herod, who is the king in the area. Herod questions him, but Jesus refuses to answer his questions. So Herod sends him back to Pilate.

So you ‚Äô ve got the chief priests , the Roman governor , and the Jewish King and they are all trying to pass off responsibility and avoid being the one to pass the sentence on Jesus . Okay so this is a kangaroo court . The Jesus: court of the chief priests basically tries him for blasphemy, but that is not a charge that holds any sway with the Romans. And so they deliver him to the Romans under the charge of sedition. Of plotting against the government. And that charge is clearly spurious. So Pilate really doesn‚Äôt want to convict him. But he also doesn‚Äôt want to be at odds with the chief priests. I mean think about this guy‚Äôs position. He‚Äôs a foreigner, he‚Äôs just trying to keep the peace. And so he wants to be on good terms with the local religious leaders. So he devises what he thinks is a clever solution. There is a robber, a man named Barabbas, presumably a notorious criminal. And there is a tradition that one prisoner will be released on passover. So there is a crow outside of his palace awaiting the verdict of this trial. And he goes out to them and says I find no fault in this man, who do you want me to release, the innocent Jesus, or the obviously criminal Barabbas? But what he hasn‚Äôt counted on is that this is a picked crowd of supporters of the chief priests. And so they cry out ‚ÄúBarabbas!‚Äù And so Pilate ceremonially washes his hands to try to clear himself of any guilt in this execution. But ultimately he does free Barabbas and hand Jesus to his soldiers to be killed. So this has been a miscarriage of from start to finish. He is apprehended under one charge, tried under another, is found innocent, and is still executed. He is first scourged, which is to be severely whipped. Then he is humiliated. He is given mock regal regalia: a crown of thorns, a scarlet robe, and a reed to hold as his scepter. He is then taken to a hill called Golgotha where he is crucified. In The New Testament In Its World, NT Wright writes: ‚ÄúCrucifixion was a brutal and barbaric form of execution. If you had ever seen a crucifixion (and they were common in places like Judea and Galilee), the experience would have been terrifying. It would leave you with irrepressible memories of naked half-dead men dying a protracted death for days on end, covered in blood and flies, their flesh gnawed at by rats, their members ripped at by wild dogs, their faces pecked by crows, the victims mocked and jeered by sadistic torturers and other bystanders, while relatives nearby, weeping uncontrollably, would be helpless to do anything for them.‚Äù Crucifixion was a powerful symbol throughout the Roman", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/jesus", "title": "Jesus", "chunk_index": 24, "publication_date": "2024-09-25", "total_chunks_in_doc": 29}}
{"text": "members ripped at by wild dogs , their faces pecked by crows , the victims mocked and jeered by sadistic torturers and other bystanders , while relatives nearby , weeping uncontrollably , would be helpless to do anything for them . ‚Äù Crucifixion was a powerful symbol throughout the Roman Jesus: world. It was not just a means of liquidating undesirables; it did so with maximum degradation and humiliation. It said, loud and clear: we are in charge here; you are our property; we can do what we like with you. It insisted, coldly and brutally, on the absolute sovereignty of Rome, and of Caesar. It told an implicit story, of the uselessness of rebel recalcitrance and the ruthlessness of imperial power. It said in particular: this is what happens to rebel leaders. Crucifixion was a symbolic act with a clear and frightening meaning. Okay, so crucifixion really rubs your nose in your own powerlessness. Not only are we going to execute this person, but we are going to do it publicly so that you have to think about how powerless you are to stop us. The physical process is that a person has their hands and feet nailed to a wooden structure, which is then raised to display the dying criminal. The actual cause of death varied. Some would die from loss of blood, but more often they died from exposure, starvation, and suffocation. Once the person is no longer able to support their weight on the nails in their feet, they have to hang awkwardly in a position that doesn‚Äôt allow their lungs to expand and they are no longer able to breathe properly. It‚Äôs not a good way to go. Once he is is put up on the cross, Jesus famously says seven things. Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. Then he is actually next to two criminals who were crucified on the same day, one of whom derides Jesus, but the other comes to his defense. And Jesus says to the latter criminal: ‚ÄúToday, you will be with me in paradise.‚Äù Then Jesus says to his mother who is there watching him die ‚ÄúWoman, behold your son.‚Äù as he points to John. Thereby giving John the responsibility to watch over his family after he is dead. He then despairs, and cries out ‚ÄúMy God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?‚Äù Subsequently, the effects of the torture and execution begin to kick in. Jesus then says ‚ÄúI thirst,‚Äù after which he is given a disgusting mixture of vinegar and gall, which he rejects. His final two sayings are ‚ÄúIt is finished,‚Äù and ‚ÄúFather, into your hands I commend my spirit.‚Äù The Romans don‚Äôt want to offend Jewish sensibilities by leaving the bodies up on the sabbath day.

So for the two criminals next to Jesus , Jesus: they break their legs to speed up their deaths. But when they come to Jesus, he is already dead, presumably because he was tortured more than the other criminals prior to his crucifixion. The soldiers pierce his side with a spear to be sure that Jesus is dead. Two wealthy followers of Jesus, Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, then take his body and dress it and give him a proper burial in a well appointed tomb. ‚Äç Resurrection ‚Äç Now obviously any single point in the life of Jesus can be challenged. Any of you who don‚Äôt believe in Jesus are obviously not going to believe in any of the miracles discussed. But the preceding account still probably forms a pretty coherent narrative of what Jesus‚Äôs life was like. But this is the part where the believers have to part with the non-believers. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, not his mother, but a third Mary, come to the tomb, and find the stone that guarded the entrance rolled away. And they run into an angel who tells them ‚ÄúFear not: For I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.‚Äù That is from Matthew. According to Luke the angel says ‚ÄúWhy seek ye the living among the dead?‚Äù According to John, it is Mary who first encounters Jesus. But many of the disciples speak with him, and even eat and socialize with him. According to Matthew, Jesus ended his work on the earth with these words: 18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. 19 ¬∂ Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.

We don ‚Äô t know much , but we don ‚Äô t know nothing . Jesus: Here is what NT Wright says: ‚Äç It is quite easy to lay out a brief list of things that few will deny about Jesus‚Äô life and public activity. He was most likely born in what we now call 4 BC (the calculation of the BC‚ÄìAD divide took place in the sixth century, based on limited information). He grew up in Galilee, in the town of Nazareth, close to the major city of Sepphoris. He spoke Aramaic, at least some Hebrew, and probably some Greek as well. He emerged as a public figure in around AD 28, in the context of the initially similar work of John the Baptist. He summoned people to repent (in other words, to turn back from the ways they were going), and announced the kingdom, or reign, of Israel‚Äôs God, using parables in particular to do so. He journeyed around the villages of Galilee, announcing his message and enacting it by effecting remarkable cures, including exorcisms, and by sharing in table-fellowship with a socio-culturally wide group. He called a group of close disciples, among whom twelve were given special status. His activities, especially one dramatic action in the Temple, incurred the wrath of some elements in the Jewish world, notably (at least towards the end) of the high-priestly establishment. Partly as a result of this, he was handed over to the Romans and executed in the manner regularly used for insurrectionists. His followers claimed, soon afterwards, that he had been raised from the dead. They carried on his work in a new way, and some of them were persecuted for doing so, both by Jews and by pagans. ‚Äç If you are a premium subscriber, I am going to get into all of my takeaways here shortly, as well as a bunch of my endnotes. ‚Äç But I do want to end with one last takeaway. Which is that Jesus‚Äôs willingness to die for his message was obviously a huge key to its success. ‚Äç And a huge key to the success of the early Christian church. Almost all of the apostles followed Jesus‚Äôs example and were killed for their beliefs. Many of the rank and file were persecuted and killed as well. ‚Äç And this willingness to die for their beliefs is a big part of what created ever more converts. That is why the Pope wears red shoes. It represents that they have been dipped in the blood of the martyrs. ‚Äç This is why Paul, one of the most important early apostles, becomes a Christian.

I think that is what Paul in the emotional space to have a vision. ‚Äç So in many ways that is the most important lesson of Jesus for those willing to start a movement. You can‚Äôt fake it.

{"text": "The Rothchilds: HELLO and welcome to How to Take Over the World. This is Ben Wilson. ‚Äç So I was thinking of doing an episode on the richest person of all time. Because being really rich sounds nice and I‚Äôd like to learn how to do it. But first I had to figure out who IS the richest person of all time. And as I was reading up on different arguments for different people, I read this really interesting story: ‚Äç The story goes that it‚Äôs the middle of the 1800s and clouds of war are forming over Europe. France and Germany are at each other‚Äôs throats once again, and people are just braced for war, waiting for it to break out. ‚Äç In the middle of this situation, there is an old grandma sitting in her attic on her rocking chair. A friend comes to visit her and they are chatting about the news, and the friend says ‚ÄúThis situation is horrible, I‚Äôm so worried, it looks like war is going to break out again.‚Äù And the old grandma says ‚ÄúOh don‚Äôt worry, war won‚Äôt break out. My sons won‚Äôt allow it.‚Äù And she‚Äôs right. Despite everyone‚Äôs fears the year comes and goes without a war. ‚Äç Now, that‚Äôs pretty impressive. Obviously my ears perked up when i heard that because if you‚Äôre interested in people who have taken over the world, that sounds like it fits the bill. Apparently these sons were so powerful, they could control nations, they could decide who went to war and who didn‚Äôt. ‚Äç So who were these guys? They were the Rothschild sons. And the Rothschilds are a family of Jewish bankers who originated in Frankfurt, Germany in the late 1700s and spread out across Europe and eventually into the United States. And they were very, very wealthy, and some people argue that they were the wealthiest family of all time. ‚Äç Now that story. It‚Äôs apocryphal, in all likelihood, it never actually happened. And in all honesty, the story is an exaggeration. They couldn‚Äôt really stop two world powers from going to war. But while maybe it wasn‚Äôt impossible to make war without the consent of the Rothschild brothers, by the mid 1800s, the Rothschilds were making decisions on a geopolitical level. At least one country owes its existence to the Rothschilds, arguably two.

{"text": "Rothschilds were making decisions on a geopolitical level . At least one country owes its existence to the Rothschilds , arguably two . You could make the case , and many people have , that in the early 1800s the Rothschild family decided the outcome of the greatest war the The Rothchilds: world had ever seen up to that point: The Napoleonic wars. You could say that it was really him that beat Napoleon. ‚Äç Obviously, I have profiled Napoleon on this podcast, and the volume of his accomplishments is astonishing and impressive. As a military commander he went 54-8-2. And of those 8 defeats, only 2, Waterloo and Leipzig, were real defeats. The kind he so often inflicted on his opponents. But we also know he died completely defeated and out of power. How do you win that much and still lose? The Rothschild is a big reason why. ‚Äç Their financial capabilities were just as important to that war as the strategic abilities of any general. We‚Äôll get into the details of all that later. But that to me, is power. ‚Äç One is because they were extravagantly wealthy, perhaps the wealthiest family of all time, and so I wanted to discover the secrets of that wealth. And secondly because they were able to turn that wealth into real power. ‚Äç As I read the story of the Rothschild family, it became very clear that the strategies to becoming extremely wealthy have not changed in 200 years. And the strategies for turning that wealth into power have not changed. You can see a lot of similarities between them and the great financiers and great wealth generators of our day. And i‚Äôll point out those similarities as we go. But suffice it to say if you are looking to be the world‚Äôs first trillionaire, this is a pretty good story to learn about. ‚Äç One disclaimer: The Rothschilds were powerful. So powerful, that they have sparked the imagination of conspiracy theorists all over the world, then and now. Some conspiracy theorists claim that today, in 2019, the Rothschilds secretly run a one world government and they use their illuminati pawns to control all the world‚Äôs governments and all that kind of stuff. People claim they are the puppet masters who really control the strings. A lot of these conspiracies are pretty anti-semitic. It‚Äôs the scary JEWS with their JEW GOLD that are hypnotizing the world and making world leaders do their bidding. ‚Äç That is not the case. The Rothschilds are still a wealthy family to this day, which is pretty remarkable, it‚Äôs been a couple hundred years.

By The Rothchilds: comparison, Jeff Bezos was worth well over $100 billion. ‚Äç So if you do extra research and read some of the conspiracy stuff. Don‚Äôt buy it. Don‚Äôt believe it. ‚Äç I should note my sources. I mainly relied on two excellent books for this episode: The first is a biography called ‚ÄúFounder‚Äù by ‚ÄúAmos Elon‚Äù and the second is an economic history of the family and its financial firm, ‚ÄúThe House of Rothschild Volume 1 Money‚Äôs Prophets‚Äù, and it is by Niall Ferguson.

This episode is going to focus on the man who started it all, a man by the name of Mayer Amschel Rothschild. I‚Äôm going to cover the rest of the family in later episodes. ‚Äç But to talk about Mayer, I want to start with a mental exercise. ‚Äç Imagine it is the early 1800s, and you are a wealthy merchant headed to Frankfurt, Germany and you have an appointment to meet Mayer Rothschild. At this time, he isn‚Äôt the wealthiest man in the world, but he is a very successful banker with considerable wealth. ‚Äç You‚Äôre on a boat on the Main river. Most traders arrived by boat. And as you‚Äôre first arriving at Frankfurt for the first time, you‚Äôre navigating the busy waters and you notice a large mural on an exterior wall of the city. ‚Äç As you look carefully, to your shock you realize that it is a depiction of a large fat pig, with Jews nursing from it and eating its excrement. Since the man you are going to meet, again, one of the richest in the world, is himself Jewish, you find this not only revolting, but extremely shocking. ‚Äç You pass the mural and reach the docks. The docks are chalk full of merchants, loading and unloading barrels and bags of every commodity imaginable. As you pass by these, you notice the wide city walls, which have been turned into promenades, walking paths. You also notice the signs saying ‚ÄúNo Jews Allowed‚Äù outside these walking paths. ‚Äç Next you notice the enormous cathedral. It looms over the city. Here, the Holy Roman Emperor has been elected for hundreds of years in solemn ceremonies. Passing by it, you cross the main street, and see some of the beautiful, enormous homes.

You start scanning the houses to see if you can figure out The Rothchilds: which one is Rothschild‚Äôs, and obviously you‚Äôre looking for the biggest one. ‚Äç You ask a man on the corner which house mister Rothschild lives in. Rothschild? He says. He lives in the Judengasse, the Jewish Quarter. He points you in the other direction and so you start walking toward the Judengasse. You smell it and hear it before you see it. Ten thousand people packed into a single block. ‚Äç The Judengasse isn‚Äôt really just a city block, it‚Äôs a world within a world. It is completely walled off, and you have to enter through a gate. As you pass through the gate, a guard tells you to be out before nightfall, when the gates are locked, shutting the Jews in for the night. As you get your first glimpse inside, you can barely believe how many people there are. ‚Äç The Judengasse had grown significantly over the years in terms of population, but it had not been allowed to grow at all in terms of space. The consequence was a truly extraordinary level of overcrowding. The skinniest houses you have ever seen are squeezed in next to each other all along the street. There are houses on top of those houses, and houses behind houses where their backyard should be. There were no more yards in the Judengasse. Every last inch of the neighborhood is filled with houses, shops, and people. ‚Äç And so you ask someone on the street where the Rothschilds live. They point you toward a home, pretty much like any of the others. Nice? Yes. Comfortable? Yes. But not significantly different from many other homes found on the Judengasse. ‚Äç You walk in to the bottom floor of the house to find the banking operation. Mayer is there, very much involved in the day to day affairs, and his wife and daughters are helping keep the books. He‚Äôs also employed a few local Jewish boys to help out, at least one of them from less fortunate circumstances. Mister Rothschild greets you personally, and that‚Äôs where we will leave this mental exercise. I‚Äôll leave it to you to imagine the deals you make and the untold fortunes that you eventually reap from it. ‚Äç Now that contrast is obviously pretty surprising. It is like if Jeff Bezos were African-AMerican and he still lived in a predominantly black neighborhood in Birmingham, Alabama or something like that.

They probably should have come from somewhere else. Really from anywhere else. Frankfurt was terribly oppressive toward Jews at the time. ‚Äç They were forced to pay higher taxes than their Christian neighbors. They were forced to pronounce loyalty oaths that proclaimed them members of a cursed race. They were not allowed to farm, or trade in most types of commodities. And if a Jew was walking on the street and someone said ‚ÄúJew, pay your dues.‚Äù they had to take off their hats, step aside, and bow. They wore insignia marking them out as Jews, yellow patches for men and veils for women. ‚Äç This is at a time in Europe, the mid 1700s, when the idea of natural human rights was sweeping through Europe. And yet Ludwig I of Bavaria, Holy Roman Emperor, defined the Jews of Frankfurt‚Äôs status this way ‚ÄúYou are ours in body and possession. We may make, do, and deal with you as it pleases us.‚Äù ‚Äç And by the way, this was not typical. I mean it when I say the Rothschilds probably should have come from any other city. It‚Äôs not like every European city or even every German city treated its Jewish inhabitants this way. Frankfurt was known for its harsh treatment of Jews. Indeed, they WANTED to be known for their hatred of Jews. ‚Äç You can see it in that mural I was talking about at the beginning of the episode. This was one of the most prominent pieces of public art in the city and it is a mural of Jews eating excrement from a pig. So this is not a city that was quietly anti-semitic, it was very upfront about it. Proud of it even. ‚Äç Mayer Amschel Rothschild is born into this environment in 1744. ‚Äç In terms of physical appearance, Elon describes him as ‚Äútall with large penetrating eyes, a high forehead, sensuous lips, and a good-natured, ironice (some may have thought sly) smile.‚Äù ‚Äç His family had only recently acquired the name Rothschild.

English is a Germanic language after all . ‚Äç Mayer ‚Äô s father was a small - time money The Rothchilds: lender and merchant. They weren‚Äôt wealthy. Virtually all of the houses in the Judengasse were split between multiple families, and the Rothschilds were no exception to that: Their family had a part share of a house and shared their home with other families. ‚Äç Rothschild received a typical Jewish education as a young man, which was virtually entirely religious. And he carried this devotion with him his entire life, he visited the synagogue and prayed almost every single day. ‚Äç His father died when he was 11, and his mother when he was 12. He was raised thereafter by his older siblings and other relatives. But they didn‚Äôt have to do it for too long. ‚Äç When he was 13 years old Mayer was apprenticed to a wealthy merchant named Oppenheimer in the German city of Hannover. This was a stroke of good luck. It was a nice placement for him. Mayer learned the ins and outs of international trade and money-exchanging. And he was learning from a good source: Oppenheimer was one of the most successful Jewish bankers in Germany. And by the way, I say Germany, but there was no concept of Germany at the time. It was not governed as a whole and the people living in the area we know now as Germany felt little-to-no patriotism or kinship with one another. The cities were independent, free cities, often with little in common. ‚Äç For example, Frankfurt was really terrible toward Jews, and Hannover, where Mayer apprenticed just 160 miles away, was one of the most tolerant cities in Europe. In Hannover he had many of the basic freedoms that were missing in Frankfurt. ‚Äç Imagine growing up in the conditions that Mayer did, and all of the sudden having your entire world opened to you. You go from living your entire life in one loud, smelly, dark block, to being able to go wherever you want. And no one is making you wear a yellow patch or bow to Christians on the sidewalk or any of that other stuff. ‚Äç And yet, when he was done with his apprenticeship, Mayer returned to Frankfurt, married a girl from Frankfurt, started having children in Frankfurt, and stayed there for his whole life. ‚Äç He was always incredibly close with his tight-knit Jewish community in Frankfurt, and as far as I can tell, never considered leaving. ‚Äç In Frankfurt, Mayer goes joins his older brother Calmann in business and becomes a small-time lender and merchant.

This is in 1763 , Mayer is 19 years old . This isn ‚Äô t exactly high - falutin ‚Äô The Rothchilds: international banking. This is really basic stuff. But he achieves quite a bit of success from the get go. ‚Äç And why does he have so much success from the get go? You might remember from the Caesar episodes that my theory is that the #1 common attribute among the great ones is not intelligence or charisma. It‚Äôs energy. People who achieve great things have tons of energy. ‚Äç So of course I was not surprised to see this as the second sentence in the Elon biography. Again, this is the second sentence in the whole book: ‚ÄúRothschild was a man of seemingly inexhaustible energy.‚Äù ‚Äç So again, this is just more proof, if you‚Äôre looking to identify people who are going to achieve greatness, ask yourself who is the one with inexhaustible energy. Who is the one that can keep going and going and going? ‚Äç Okay so what is Rothschild doing with all this boundless energy? He would love to be an international banker like the man he just apprenticed for, but that‚Äôs not an opportunity available to him at this moment in time. He doesn‚Äôt have the connections or even more importantly, the necessary capital, the money. You have to have money to lend money. ‚Äç But Mayer is a pretty smart guy and he has a plan. He needs money and connections, and he figures out a way he can get both at the same time. He starts to specialize in dealing in rare coins and medals. At the time, the nobility of Europe loved to collect that kind of stuff. And Mayer develops a really smart business model. ‚Äç He basically creates a mail-order business before there was such a thing. He created beautiful catalogues. People remarked on them at the time. They were incredible. Remember he‚Äôs selling to the nobility, and really only the nobility that is in central Europe pretty close to Frankfurt. This is a limited customer base. He doesn‚Äôt have to mass print these catalogues. So they are bound books with gold embossed lettering on the front and they‚Äôre really beautifully crafted. ‚Äç Uncommonly for this day and age, these noblemen could look through the catalogue, and then choose the medals and coins they were interested in based on the description provided and Rothschild would send them the medals and coins for free!

You can see similarities to these internet direct - to - consumer businesses that The Rothchilds: do so well today. Almost like a Warby Parker or Casper mattresses or something. ‚Äç This is one of the most fascinating parts of Rothschild‚Äôs career to me because it is SO relatable to our current day. He understood his customers well, he knew what they wanted, and he provided value. And he got a successful business for it. And the business was not just successful for the money it was bringing in, which was good but pretty modest, but it was more important for the people it was connecting him with. There is some truth to the saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not what you know, it‚Äôs who you know.‚Äù ‚Äç I would just add ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not who you know, it‚Äôs how you know them.‚Äù And Rothschild is meeting some really important people, German princes and dukes, and he‚Äôs meeting them in a really important way. He‚Äôs given the opportunity to do work for them. They know he is reliable, trustworthy, hard-working, and that he‚Äôs giving them good deals. All these dukes and princes now know that they can trust Mayer Rothschild. So if your ultimate goal is to do international banking for these guys, well that‚Äôs a pretty good start, right? ‚Äç And by the way, his friendly relations with these ruling elites is getting him the ability to travel freely and freedom from many of the restrictions placed on his fellow Jews. ‚Äç At the same time as he‚Äôs gaining a little bit more money, he‚Äôs also starting to trade commodities like cotton, coffee, and sugar, and doing some small-time banking. ‚Äç Now during this venture, he has the good fortune of selling coins to someone named Wilhelm, the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel. Landgrave is not a word we hear a lot today, but it was a noble title that was basically the equivalent of Duke. And Willhelm is one of these great characters. He‚Äôs a larger than life guy. ‚Äç Willhelm occupies this unique spot in that he‚Äôs not quite as powerful as a king when it comes to land, armies, and prestige. However, Wilhelm did have a fortune that could rival that of any king. He was thought by many to be the richest man in Europe and he may well have been. He had inherited a bunch of money, but he also did a lot himself to make even more.

He was a shrewd and enthusiastic businessman . ‚Äç The book , Founder refers to Wilhelm as one of the best examples we have The Rothchilds: of a ‚Äúpure capitalist.‚Äù This guy loved getting money for the sake of getting money. Like an ebenezer scrooge type. Although I must say, he fathered something like a dozen or so children out of wedlock, so it wasn‚Äôt just for the sake of getting more money. He apparently enjoyed other activities. ‚Äç But Willhelm, as you might guess, was not exactly a paragon of charity and virtue. He was very cut throat. He was suspicious and unyielding. But, one good thing about Wilhelm was that he was not prejudiced at all. ‚Äç He wasn‚Äôt some open-hearted guy who was a true believer in religious and racial tolerance. At least there‚Äôs nothing in the historical record to indicate as much. But if you could help him make money, he didn‚Äôt care if you were Christian, Jewish, black, white, or whatever. He liked you. Willhelm‚Äôs territory was very close to Frankfurt, and so this is an ideal partner for Mayer Rothschild: ‚Äç Here is a guy who has a huge fortune that he‚Äôs trying to invest. He needs help doing it. He‚Äôs not prejudiced against Jews. And he‚Äôs close by. So Rothschild wants to be a banker for him. But that‚Äôs easier said than done. Wilhelm already has bankers. And at this point, Rothschild is just someone who sells him coins and medals from time to time. ‚Äç Something happens that helps to change that in 1776. If you‚Äôre American, the significance of that year is probably pretty obvious to you. It‚Äôs the beginning of the American revolution. ‚Äç You may remember that there were some foreign troops fighting along the British. The Hessian mercenaries. Well these are Willhelm‚Äôs troops, he is the ruler of Hesse. He was basically renting them out to the British. And the British empire was extremely wealthy and paid A LOT of money for these troops. But then the question arises, if you are the British King, how do you pay Willhelm for his troops? ‚Äç You can‚Äôt send him British money, British pounds, because what‚Äôs he going to do with that? He can‚Äôt buy anything in Germany with British pounds. And you don‚Äôt want to send him a local German currency, because you don‚Äôt have any, if you‚Äôre the British. ‚Äç So what ends up happening is that Britain sends Willhelm promissory notes that can be redeemed for British pounds.

He then has to sell those to intermediaries at a The Rothchilds: discount, who sell them to other intermediaries, who redeem them for British pounds. ‚Äç Are you with me? So let‚Äôs say Willhelm sells his soldiers to Britain for a million pounds. They give him ten thousand pieces of paper that say ‚ÄúThis is worth 100 pounds‚Äù or whatever. He then sells those papers to local bankers for maybe 90% of their value. Those bankers auction them off to merchants for let‚Äôs say 95% of that value, and those merchants do the work of actually travelling to Britain and redeeming the notes for British pounds for full value. ‚Äç It‚Äôs basically a big game of telephone where everyone takes a little cut as the British pounds make their way back to London. That‚Äôs a little bit of a simplification but it will work just fine for our purposes. This is called discounting. And for a talented banker, this business could be very profitable. ‚Äç So Rothschild starts with rare coins, but he really wants to help Wilhelm to discount these notes. However, Willhelm already has well-established bankers to do this. He likes Rothschild well enough for selling him coins and medals, but he‚Äôs got no reason to give him this big banking deal. But Rothschild does get some smaller pieces of the business. Willhelm is having big established banks do 95% of the work, but he‚Äôs giving Rothschild a tiny slice. ‚Äç In this state, Rothschild is doing well, he‚Äôs getting wealthier and wealthier. He‚Äôs one of the richest Jews in the Judengasse but not the richest, and his wealth was certainly nothing to be remarked upon. This continues until he is 40! These things take time. He‚Äôs 40 and he‚Äôs not even the richest guy in his neighborhood yet. That‚Äôs one of the things you realize about these people, they are all patient and let their wealth slowly build over time. ‚Äç But then everything changes for Mayer Rothschild. And why? What do you think happens? Think about this, what could it be that takes someone from being a very successful businessman to one of the richest men in the world and founding a financial dynasty the likes of which the world had never seen? What is that change? Let me introduce it this way: ‚Äç Just this weekend I was reading an article called ‚ÄúHow to be successful‚Äù by a guy named Sam Altman.

{"text": "reading an article called ‚Äú How to be successful ‚Äù by a guy named Sam Altman . Same is the President of Y Combinator , which is a seed accelerator , it ‚Äô s kind of like an early - early stage venture capital firm that invests in companies that The Rothchilds: are just starting. And they have helped launch companies like DropBox, Airbnb, Reddit, Stripe‚Ä¶ their companies are worth more than $80 billion total. ‚Äç So this guy has seen what it takes to found some of the most successful businesses in the world. And in his article ‚Äúhow to be successful‚Äù he lays out 13 things you have to do to be exceptionally successful. I want to read from #1, the most important principle. ‚Äç ‚Äú1. Compound Yourself. Compounding is magic. Look for it everywhere. Exponential curves are the key to wealth generation. You want to be an exponential curve yourself‚Äîyou should aim for your life to follow an ever-increasing up-and-to-the-right trajectory. It‚Äôs important to move towards a career that has a compounding effect‚Äîmost careers progress fairly linearly.‚Äù ‚Äç So how does this relate to our good friend Mayer? The thing that makes him so successful is that he literally compounds himself. His sons start coming of age, and he incorporates them into the business right away. He was always a very devoted father, he focused really hard on raising them the right way, making them work hard, and all five of his sons turn out to be little mini-me‚Äôs. They are just about as intelligent and energetic as their own father. ‚Äç So this is the time when his oldest son, Amschel is now 16, and his second oldest Salomon is 15. And they are able to take on enough responsibility from the main business that it frees up Mayer to do some new things. ‚Äç First, he starts a transportation and forwarding business. It starts doing really well, and it also pays dividends in information. They are receiving and forwarding mail across Europe, and this gives them great access to the news of the day. ‚Äç And by the way, if you want to see a parallel to the modern day, check out Michael Bloomberg. He‚Äôs worth more than $50 billion. And how did he become so wealthy? International finance, much like Rothschild, and he started Bloomberg News and other financial news related businesses because he knows what Rothschild knew, immediate access to information is crucial for good investing. So Rothschild‚Äôs forwarding business is kind of like the Bloomberg news of its day he‚Äôs using it to get news from all over Europe and make intelligent investments from that. ‚Äç A cool story demonstrates just how important rapid information was to Rothschild.

Eventually , he establishes bank branches in other cities , and of course they would use The Rothchilds: their own forwarding service to communicate information between branches. And he uses this information to invest. ‚Äç Well a problem arises when the local officials decide that Jews can‚Äôt be trusted, and all their mail needs to be held for a day, read, and inspected before it can be picked up. So what does Rothschild do? He instructs his foreign agents to send him mail in colored envelopes and comes up with a coding system. A red and white striped envelope means the pound is going to rise. A blue and white striped envelope means the pound is going to fall. Etc. ‚Äç Then at the end of the day they would finally get the actual letter and be able to read it, but in the meantime he could act on the basic information and make wise investments based on it. That just goes to show how important good, fast information is. ‚Äç This forwarding business helps the firm to quickly grow, and then something else happens that helps make Rothschild even more wealthy. As mentioned at the beginning of the episode, he was hugely influenced by one of the other historical figures profiled on this podcast: Napoleon Bonaparte. ‚Äç In 1792, the war of the first coalition begins. This is France against a coalition that included Austria, Britain, and a few other kingdoms. Willhelm, who remember, is the landgrave of Hesse, the ruler of Hesse, weighed whether he should remain neutral or join the coalition. In the end, he chose to join the coalition. One reason for doing so is that the British offered him a huge cash subsidy to do so. ‚Äç Rothschild gets hired to provision the allied army. Not just Willhelm‚Äôs men but men from elsewhere in the Holy Roman Empire. This means both acquiring supplies like wheat, horses, and uniforms, and also distributing the soldiers‚Äô wages. ‚Äç And why does Rothschild get this contract instead of some other rich Christian banker? ‚Äç The writer Christian Willhelm Berghoeffer, writing in the 1920s with access to original documents from the era, wrote: ‚ÄúAt this time of the greatest money shortage, Rothschild appeared more resourceful and more efficient than the banking house which occupied the prime position not only in Frankfurt but throughout Germany.‚Äù ‚Äç Okay, so the first reason is that he‚Äôs just more efficient and resourceful. He‚Äôs young and hungry and able to negotiate better deals by being smarter. Bottom line. But he also has an air of dependability.

Here ‚Äô s another quote , this one from a contemporary Lawaetz , ‚Äú Herr Rothschild always struck me as unusually solid , prompt , and The Rothchilds: fully worthy of confidence. Envy may speak against him, but he is a good man who deserves respect.‚Äù ‚Äç It‚Äôs amazing how much the small stuff has a big effect. Simply being reliable and prompt made a big difference for Rothschild. ‚Äç This is a huge, complicated task. Rothschild frankly doesn‚Äôt have the money for it. But he gets the contract and then he makes deals with other Jewish bankers in his network to help him front the capital necessary to supply the coalition army. ‚Äç This would be a huge source of income for Rothschild for the next couple decades. In 1800, Mayer became an official Crown Agent for the Austrians, and throughout the Napoleonic Wars continued to aid the anti-Napoleon cause. ‚Äç Then disaster struck. In 1806, Napoleon defeated the fifth coalition at the battle of Jena. After the Battle of Jena, Napoleon decided to punish Wilhelm for this show of insolence. His territory was promptly invaded, and Wilhelm fled into exile. ‚Äç Rothschild remained in Frankfurt, under great risk. Remember, this is a man who was helping to fund, clothe, and arm the armies that had been opposing the French. Now the French have taken them over. Rothschild could lose everything if they decided to confiscate his wealth. ‚Äç But that‚Äôs not what happens. Instead, the French invasion is what truly makes Rothschild his money. ‚Äç Willhelm secretly turns over all of his assets to Rothschild before leaving. This demonstrates the immense trust that Wilhelm must have had for Mayer. Wilhelm was one of the wealthiest monarchs in Europe, and to leave his huge estate in the hands of a single agent, was risky. Nevertheless, Wilhelm had little choice. The French military governor of Frankfurt was suspicious, of course, of Mayer‚Äôs ties with Wilhelm and kept a close eye on the Jewish banker. At times, Rothschild‚Äôs house was searched and he was interrogated for hours by French soldiers. ‚Äç But Mayer was extremely skillful at keeping up the deception and hiding his management of the Landgrave‚Äôs affairs. He kept an entire second ledger, but this one was falsified. It didn‚Äôt include any of the Landgrave‚Äôs assets and managed to explain away any income from those assets. ‚Äç He went so far as to have a secret basement installed in his house. This basement had a false wall with a secret passageway that led to a neighbor‚Äôs basement, so that even if the French authorities discovered the basement, he could move money and documents to the neighbor‚Äôs basement before they could search it.

{"text": ". This basement had a false wall with a secret passageway that led to a neighbor ‚Äô s basement , so that even if the French authorities discovered the basement , he could move money and documents to the neighbor ‚Äô s basement before they could search it . And The Rothchilds: by the way, this happened. Multiple times. ‚Äç Now that Rothschild is fully managing one of the largest estates in Europe, he‚Äôs playing with a lot of capital, and he can make himself some real money. And this is another lesson. People who are really successful have a ‚ÄúHeads I win, tails you lose.‚Äù Strategy. ‚Äç If the coalition had beaten Napoleon, Rothschild would continue to supply them, fund them, and make money off of their war effort. When Napoleon won instead, Rothschild got to manage Willhelm‚Äôs estate and get money that way. ‚Äç The writer and investor Nassim Taleb calls this being antifragile. If you have a fragile strategy, it collapses when there is a shock. So for example if you have a business and it a recession hits and your business folds, that is a fragile business. ‚Äç The next best thing you can be is durable. A durable business is one that has some cash reserves, and is able to make it through a recession without collapsing. ‚Äç But the best thing you can be is antifragile. So for a business, that might mean you actually make money in a recession. So think of a thrift store, it‚Äôs an imperfect example, but it helps illustrate the point. If the economy is booming, people spend their money at a thrift store, they‚Äôre doing just fine. ‚Äç As soon as a recession hits, you have more people struggling, more people unemployed, more people who need to shop at thrift stores. So during the recession, a thrift store actually does better. ‚Äç And that is what Rothschild does. He‚Äôs antifragile. He‚Äôs prepared for every eventuality, and things that would bankrupt a lesser banker, actually end up making Rothschild even richer. ‚Äç 1806 would prove to be a critical year for the Rothschild in other ways, too. First, the Holy Roman Empire (which was neither Holy nor Roman nor an Empire) was finally dissolved, and Frankfurt‚Äôs status as a Free Imperial City was rendered null and void. Karl von Dalberg, the new mayor, made some positive overtures towards the Jewish community, but still refused to liberalize Frankfurt‚Äôs anti-Jewish laws, and Mayer would spend much of his later life championing the cause of the Jews in Germany. ‚Äç Another event that occurred in 1806 was Napoleon‚Äôs declaration of the Continental System.

I know none of my listeners would ever forget a single piece of information from any of my episodes , but just in case you need a refresher on the continental The Rothchilds: system, here it is: ‚Äç Napoleon and the French Empire were at war with the British Empire. France had a much stronger army, and had political control that extended across Europe. However, England had a much stronger Navy, and more colonial possessions. England was able to use their Navy to completely disrupt trade with France. The quote is that Napoleon was the master of Europe, but he was also a prisoner there. He complained that he couldn‚Äôt launch a fishing boat without it being captured by the British Navy. ‚Äç So as a way to hit back at England, Napoleon tried to cut off British trade with Europe and this was called the continental system or the continental blockade. But as you might imagine, trying to make sure there are no British goods allowed in any port anywhere in Europe from Malaga, Spain to St. Petersburg, Russia, is pretty tough. Smuggling was rampant. ‚Äç And one of those people who helped smuggle goods, was none other than Mayer Rothschild. Now the Rothschilds, and Mayer in particular, prided themselves on integrity. It‚Äôs in their family motto: Concordia, integritas, industria. That‚Äôs latin for: harmony, integrity, industry. Which is actually a pretty good summary of how Mayer Rothschild achieved so much success. ‚Äç And smuggling does not seem like a very honest trade. But remember he had already committed to managing Willhelm‚Äôs money, which he is managing by keeping it away from the French authorities. So it is kind of a moral bind. Does your integrity demand that you submit to the local authorities, and in so doing renege on the commitment you made to watch over your client‚Äôs money? Or does integrity demand that you preserve your commitment to your client, and lie to the local authorities? ‚Äç Well for Rothschild, this was made easier by the fact that the Jewish community sided with the coalition. Which is not what you would expect. They were prisoners in their own city who were constantly humiliated and frequently persecuted. The French, on the other hand, treated the Jews quite liberally. After all, the French Revolution espoused ideas of human rights and equal recognition before the law. There are a number of potential reasons why the Jews of Frankfurt backed the coalition forces, some conjecture that it was like a mass case of Stockholm Syndrome. Others guess that they were pretty savvy and realized that the French would soon give up the territory they had recently acquired.

And if the old Austrian regime were put back in charge in Frankfurt and the Jews had supported the French ? That would The Rothchilds: have been interpreted as treachery, and who knows what the consequences would have been for the Jewish community. ‚Äç In any case, Rothschild was smuggling goods from England. Mostly textiles. And he was doing very well with it. Making money hand over fist. The problem with smuggling is you can make a lot of money, but there is a lot of risk. Many officials basically turned a blind eye to the smuggling that was quite clearly going on in Frankfurt. But then at one point some higher-up decides to crack down, and there is a big bonfire in the center of town and the French soldiers burn all the imported British goods. And a good deal of Rothschild‚Äôs goods are seized and burned. ‚Äç Well Rothschild is, like, traumatized by this. He says he has learned his lesson and he is NEVER going to go into smuggling this way again. And it kind of seems like an overreaction. I mean after all he had to have known there was some risk. And his losses from the entire thing were pretty modest. And yet he was enraged and embarrassed. He had quite the reaction. ‚Äç So how to explain this reaction? This reaction reminds me of Warren Buffet‚Äôs rules for investing. ‚ÄúRule #1: Never lose money. Rule #2: See rule #1.‚Äù Great investors are haunted by their losses. They HATE losing money. And you really see this with Mayer. Great investors don‚Äôt LOVE making great investments that much more than the average person. I mean of course they are always trying to make great investments. But everyone likes making money. What sets them apart is that they HATE losing money. ‚Äç Now let‚Äôs go back to Rothschild running Willhelm‚Äôs estate while he‚Äôs exiled. Wilhelm had ended up settling in Denmark, then Prague, with members of his court. From these residence-in-exile, Wilhelm sent Mayer constant letters, asking him about the state of the Prince‚Äôs holdings. Mayer, always the faithful steward, kept Wilhelm in the loop. ‚Äç Mayer‚Äôs son, Amschel, was attached to Wilhelm‚Äôs court. This acted both as a move to prove Mayer‚Äôs reliability in giving Wilhelm a trusted adviser, and also to have his son in a position to keep an eye on Wilhelm.

The Prince ‚Äô s greed and suspicion was legendary , and even a man as hard - working and honest as Mayer was not free from mistrust . ‚Äç To keep Wilhelm informed , Mayer developed a sophisticated system of sneaking letters to and from The Rothchilds: Prague, under the noses of the French. In the letters, Mayer was known as ‚ÄúPeter Arnoldi‚Äù, Wilhelm as ‚ÄúGoldstein‚Äù, and so on. The Austrians, who were still at war, on and off, with the French, allowed these secret activities to continue freely because they helped the war effort. Mayer was always able to use the political situations at the time to his advantage, choosing his sides carefully. ‚Äç This is a testament to the tact and skill of Mayer, even in difficult circumstances like a war with France. Even when dealing with an employer as anxious as Wilhelm, Mayer calmly maintained business as usual. It is very easy for a person of business to fudge the numbers and skim a little off the top, especially when their boss lives hundreds of miles away and can‚Äôt check up on you. Mayer kept his integrity and maintained Wilhelm‚Äôs interests during the latter‚Äôs long absence. ‚Äç While he‚Äôs losing out on money he could be skimming, the reputation he‚Äôs gaining as an honest steward is priceless. It‚Äôs a long-term play. ‚Äç As this is going on, Mayer‚Äôs boys are continuing to age into adulthood, and as they do he is sending them out to build a banking network across Europe. They would come to be known as the five arrows. And they establish five banking centers: ‚Äç His first son, Amschel, went to Prague, but came back to Frankfurt to run the original branch.

There are sort of varying accounts of how that happened, but London is really where the family started to make REAL money.

They are funding the war efforts of all these governments across Europe to fight against Napoleon and the French. If they lose, they are in all likelihood not be able to pay the Rothschilds back, so they are very invested in the coalition forces winning. ‚Äç You may recall that there were actually two main theatres of war that helped defeat Napoleon. The one everyone remembers is Russia. He suffered catastrophic defeat there, but he actually might have been able to recover from that if it weren‚Äôt for Spain. Napoleon invaded Spain and it turned out to be a huge debacle that tied up resources, diverted his attention, and was a huge contributing factor to his downfall. ‚Äç In March 1811, a crisis faced the anti-Napoleonic forces. The general Arthur Wellesley was leading the British forces in Spain, and the conflict there was really dirty and terrible. There were massacres and atrocities on both sides. It‚Äôs a dirty, ugly war, and Wellsley writes to London to say if they don‚Äôt get him more cash, he is going to have to halt the campaign. He says this a few more times over the coming four years. The British badly needed cash to pay their troops and allies in Spain or else they risked being completely defeated. And if they were defeated in Spain, the conflict was over. ‚Äç In London, Nathan gets a contract to pay the British troops. And he gets it because he was the only one bidding. No one had any idea how to pay the men. After all, they are trying to pay men in a warzone. And they need it in a currency that can be useful in Spain. ‚Äç Nathan buys gold using British pounds in London. The gold bullion is then forwarded to Paris, where James sells it for Spanish notes. He then smuggles the notes in false compartments in carriages to the British forces in Spain. ‚Äç Now this is massive amounts of gold that is entering the city of Paris. So how do they explain this away? James tells the French investigators that actually they‚Äôre moving lots of gold from London to Paris (which is true) because they are losing confidence in the British war effort (which is not true). ‚Äç They aren‚Äôt losing confidence in the British war effort, they‚Äôre paying British troops!

The Rothchilds: ‚Äç This is important because I think this whole mindset and philosophy was what allowed his sons to be so successful. Usually if you‚Äôre rich and you have five boys, at least one of them is going to go off the deep end. But the fact that he never dressed fancy, never moved out of their modest Judengasse home, and never displayed their vast wealth except to pay the poor with it, probably helped his sons to be hard-working and well-adjusted. ‚Äç He also technically only left them the minimum required inheritance. Now in reality, all his wealth went to his sons, but not as an inheritance. They became partners in the firm, once they earned it, and were then given a proportional share of the company. ‚Äç He wasn‚Äôt a particularly harsh father. If anything he was rather doting and kind. But he also had high expectations for his sons and gave them very little for free.Hey it‚Äôs Ben Wilson welcome to How to Take Over the World. So let‚Äôs say you lived in El Paso. I lived in El Paso for a while. Honestly it wasn‚Äôt as bad as you think. In fact, that wouldn‚Äôt make a bad motto: El Paso, not as bad as you think. But let‚Äôs say you lived in El Paso, which is a city right on the Mexican American border. And you know that Gold is selling for $100 an ounce in the U.S. and it‚Äôs selling for $90 an ounce in Mexico. You could just keep crossing the border, buying gold in Mexico, and selling it in the US to turn a profit. That is what is called arbitrage. Arbitrage is when you take advantage of price differentials to turn a profit. Why do I bring this up? Because the Rothschilds are masters of arbitrage. It‚Äôs how they become the richest family of all time. So you have to understand it. But before we get into all that, I suppose we should back up and recap last episode a little. ‚Äç Today we are talking about the richest family of all time and potentially the richest person of all time.

{"text": "banking dynasty , go ahead and listen to the previous episode in this feed , ‚Äú The Rothschilds Part 1 . ‚Äù which focuses on the founder of the family Mayer Rothschild . ‚Äç Today we are going to talk about the rest of the family going up to the The Rothchilds: present day. ‚Äç So just as a brief refresher, Mayer Rothschild was a German Jew born in the city of Frankfurt. He starts out as a small-time lender and merchant of medals and rare coins, but slowly makes his way up as he starts doing business on a larger and larger scale and eventually he is able to take over as the steward of the fortune of Willhelm, Landgrave of Hesse. ‚Äç This happens because the French invade Hesse, forcing Willhelm into hiding. The French also import liberal ideas about religious tolerance and they emancipate the Jews from many of their previous oppressions, which allows the Rothschilds to move more freely and conduct more business. Mayer puts Willhelm‚Äôs fortune to great use and starts to make real money for his family. ‚Äç He does this in part by sending his five sons out to establish new branches of the family business in London, Paris, Vienna, and Naples and one brother stays home with him in Frankfurt. ‚Äç Together, they make it pretty big, Mayer teaches his sons the three cardinal Rothschild virtues of concordia, integritas, and industria: Harmony, integrity, and industry. ‚Äç On his deathbed, Mayer tells his eldest son, ‚ÄúAmschel, keep your brothers together and you will become the richest men in Germany.‚Äù ‚Äç Mayer never moved out of the Judengasse, the Jewish ghetto in Frankfurt, and he was buried beneath a plain tombstone. ‚Äç Which brings us to this episode! So the brothers are in these five offices, they‚Äôre running what is essentially an investment bank, although it wasn‚Äôt called that back then, and the way they are making money at this point is, for the most part, by issuing government bonds. Government bonds were not a new invention, but the Rothschilds had radically transformed how they were issued. They made them much easier to issue, obtain, and trade. They basically invented the international bond market, and made it much easier and more common for governments to borrow money on a large scale. ‚Äç And this is right after Napoleon was defeated for the first time, all these governments just spent a ton of money to go to war with each other, they‚Äôve run up huge wartime deficits, and they badly need money. So the Rothschilds are issuing bonds to all the great powers. By 1825 they had negotiated loans for Britain, Prussia, Austria, Russia, and France, as well as many smaller states like Denmark, Hesse, and others. ‚Äç So why are all these states trusting the Rothschilds to help them issue bonds? There are a few answers", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/the-rothschilds", "title": "The Rothchilds", "chunk_index": 20, "publication_date": "2019-03-05", "total_chunks_in_doc": 36}}
{"text": "had negotiated loans for Britain , Prussia , Austria , Russia , and France , as well as many smaller states like Denmark , Hesse , and others . ‚Äç So why are all these states trusting the Rothschilds to help them issue bonds ? There are a few answers The Rothchilds: but one of the most important ones is that the Rothschilds could do it for the lowest price. They had this brilliant strategy: They would offer to help issue the bonds for much lower fees than anyone else, and then make up the difference, and much more, by speculating on those bonds in the secondary market. ‚Äç And they could do this incredibly effectively, because they have five brothers in five locations, AND if you recall from last episode, their father had established a mail and forwarding business, the best one in Europe. So they have five information centers and they can communicate faster and more reliably than anyone else in Europe. ‚Äç And now we come back to that word arbitrage. This creates incredible arbitrage opportunities. Going back to that El Paso example, they know where gold is being sold for $100 and where it‚Äôs being sold for $90 and they can quickly buy up assets move them and sell them to turn a profit. ‚Äç But for the most part they‚Äôre not buying and selling gold, although to be clear, they do that a fair amount as well, but it‚Äôs mostly government bonds. So hey, 3% bonds issued by the British government are selling for $78 bucks in Vienna but for $80 in Paris? I‚Äôll tell Amschel to buy a bunch in Vienna and I‚Äôll have James sell them in Paris. ‚Äç And because of this arbitrage advantage, they are just making money hand over fist. I mean you have to understand, their information advantage really was leaps and bounds ahead of everyone. For example, when the British defeat Napoleon at Waterloo, Nathan knows about it before the British government. Mind you the British government are the ones who were actually fighting the battle, it‚Äôs their soldiers who are fighting. You would think they would be the first to know. ‚Äç But Nathan has messengers watching the battle who take off and send messages through his courier service as soon as the outcome of the battle is certain. Nathan is notified well before parliament, so he takes the letter that he gets from his courier and takes it to parliament and says ‚Äúhey guys, we won!‚Äù And they flatly don‚Äôt believe him. They say listen, I think I‚Äôd know if we had just defeated Napoleon. ‚Äç Well Nathan actually had a second messenger watching the battle just to be sure so he gets news of the victory A SECOND TIME from another courier before the British government gets the news.

Truly this communication system is leaps and bounds ahead of anything else in the The Rothchilds: world. So that‚Äôs what is helping to create this information advantage that creates this arbitrage advantage. ‚Äç Now I want to go back to our El Paso example. We‚Äôll say in this example that you know this is a stable situation, gold always costs $90 in Mexico and always costs $100 in the United States. All you have to do is walk 5 minutes across the border and you make 10% profit. What would you do? ‚Äç You‚Äôd buy as much as you could, right? You would put all your money into buying gold in Mexico to sell in the United States. You would max our your credit cards and pour your savings into it. I mean why not? ‚Äç And that is basically what the Rothschild brothers are doing right now. In 1815 alone, they double their capital. Keep in mind they are one of the largest banks in the world already. Can you imagine if Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan Chase or Wells Fargo grew by 100% in a single year? Every dollar they can get their hands on, is going immediately into bonds, currency, or precious metals that they can exploit in this way. ‚Äç But this has a couple downsides one is that this is pretty risky, having all your capital tied up in assets. The other problem is that they were subject to liquidity crunches. They also had liabilities that they needed to make payments on from time to time, but that‚Äôs tough to do when all of your money keeps moving from asset to asset. ‚Äç Keep in mind that the Rothschild brothers are investing at such a frenetic pace that their accounting is just completely broken. It‚Äôs only in hindsight that we know they doubled their capital. They had NO IDEA how much money they were worth or how much they were making. It‚Äôs like if someone put you in a room that was stacked to the ceiling with bricks of $100 dollar bills and gave you two backpacks and said you have one minute. If I asked you at 30 seconds how much money you had, you would have no idea! You‚Äôre not stopping to count it! ‚Äç Well Carl, who was in Naples, had to make a payment and he goes looking for cash. He doesn‚Äôt have any, so he writes to Solomon at the Vienna branch, ‚ÄúHey I need cash.‚Äù Solomon responds, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have the money, James has the money in Paris.‚Äù James says I don‚Äôt have the money, Nathan must have the money.

Nathan The Rothchilds: doesn‚Äôt have the money, neither does Amschel, and all the sudden they start freaking out. ‚Äç Again, they have this vague idea that for the most part their transactions have been super profitable, but they actually don‚Äôt know for sure, and for a minute they start to wonder if they‚Äôre broke. ‚Äç Here‚Äôs the quote from Solomon ‚Äç ‚ÄúYou must have all our money over there with you. We here are stinking poor. We haven‚Äôt a penny to spare. Amschel has less than a million left and therefore the whole lot must be with you, including what we owe.. Work out where the family money is, my good Nathan. I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ Where is our money? Well, it‚Äôs just absurd. God willing it will turn up when we do the spring cleaning!‚Äù ‚Äç Amschel is also freaking out. Nathan tells him to chill and he responds and says I guess I‚Äôm rather like my eight-year-old son who asks to see our millions and thinks they must be piled up somewhere in the house. ‚Äç In 2019 it‚Äôs pretty hard to comprehend but they were just basically straight up not doing accounting. So anyways, that crisis does force them to look at their balance sheets and figure some stuff out and start doing accounting, which is a thing an investment bank should do. ‚Äç Now luckily, when they do the accounting it turns out that yep, they are in fact fabulously wealthy, which is good. Again, by volume their biggest business is helping to issue big government loans, and they are lightyears ahead of everyone else in their ability to do this, to the point where it is in fact difficult to negotiate a big government loan without Rothschild involvement. Not impossible, but at this point it‚Äôs almost impossible. It is significantly more difficult to do it without them and it‚Äôs going to cost you dearly. ‚Äç And that makes them very influential. For example, the Rothschilds were known to favor stable constitutional monarchies and peaceful regimes. Wars introduced uncertainty, and so did radical governments. Whether those were to the radical left or to the right. They didn‚Äôt like revolutionary republicans, or reactionary monarchical absolutists, because governments to either extreme tended to be unstable and short-lasting. ‚Äç So when the absolutist kingdom of Prussia badly needed a loan during this time period, the Rothschilds are able to make it conditional on Prussia adopting some very mild democratic reforms. ‚Äç Now this influence is sort of unprecedented.

Money had just never The Rothchilds: played this role on the world stage. ‚Äç If you were a nobleman in the 1700s or 1600s, what did that mean? It used to mean you were a knight and expected to mount up and fight in times of war but that‚Äôs no longer true, for the most part. It used to mean that you had a certain number of soldiers who answered directly to you but that is also no longer the case in places like England and France. What it really meant, and what was always the most important part of nobility, was that you owned land. ‚Äç Land was what made the whole thing work. Because land was the only form of durable investment that consistently generated a return. That was it and that was the power structure that everyone was used to. Sure, there were bankers, it would probably be more accurate to call them money-lenders, and there were merchants, but there was no such thing as a long-term stable investment. It was just land. ‚Äç And so besides their military power, that was one of the reasons that the nobility had so much power. They were the only ones with an investment portfolio. ‚Äç Well by creating the bond market, the Rothschilds are changing that. They are creating financial instruments that can rival land. And they are also making it possible to accumulate capital on an unprecedented scale. ‚Äç In this way the Rothschilds changed the world more than few other people can claim. I really like this quote from Heine: ‚Äç ‚ÄúI see in Rothschild one of the greatest revolutionaries who have founded modern democracy. They signify the gradual annihilation of the old aristocracy. They are Europe‚Äôs most fearful levelers. Rothschild came and destroyed the predominance of land, by raising the system of state bonds to supreme power, thereby mobilizing property and income and at the same time endowing money with the previous privileges of the land. ‚Äç He thereby created a new aristocracy, it is true, but this, resting as it does on the most unreliable of elements, on money, can never play as enduringly regressive a role as the former aristocracy, which was rooted in the land, in the earth itself. For money is more fluid than water, more elusive than the air, and one can gladly forgive the impertinences of the new nobility in consideration of its ephemerality.

But then again I am living in 2019 , and many people at the time decidedly did NOT love that . People The Rothchilds: were shocked and confused and amazed by these people with all this money who are foisting democracy on a kingdom like Prussia. As you might imagine, the Rothschilds generated A LOT of controversy, then as now. People wrote about them in the newspapers, they were frequently caricatured and lampooned in political cartoons, and were the subject of rumors, vitriol, and hatred. ‚Äç I love Solomon‚Äôs response to this kind of thing. Nathan complained about a particularly nasty cartoon that had been drawn about him in London, and Solomon responded, ‚ÄúI am not going to cry about the fact that you have been caricatured. So are the kings and emperors. May God grant that this is the worst thing that ever happens to us‚Ä¶ May our sons also be caricatured, please God, as soon as they become well known in this world. I wish this for our darling children.‚Äù ‚Äç It never feels good to have people say bad things about you, but that is the price of admission for greatness. You can‚Äôt have everyone like you and accomplish anything great. You just can‚Äôt. And that‚Äôs when Solomon is alluding to here. You know who doesn‚Äôt have haters? The assistant to the branch manager of your local paper company. No one cares enough to be a hater. ‚Äç So if you‚Äôve got haters, if you‚Äôve got people who dislike you and disapprove of what you‚Äôre doing. Listen to them, but keep in mind that that‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing. It means that you‚Äôre doing something that matters and makes a difference. Otherwise, they would just ignore you. ‚Äç So the Rothschilds are taking advantage of these arbitrage advantages, but also pretty quickly their sheer size and scale becomes a primary advantage. They‚Äôre the first banking institution of this size, they‚Äôre 10x bigger than their nearest competitor, when the Bank of England starts to go under in 1825, they turn to the Rothschilds for a bailout. That‚Äôs how big they were, they are bailing out the largest central bank in the world. ‚Äç One of the other reasons that they are growing is they plowed all their profits back into the business, something that none of their competitors did.

He says ‚ÄúRelations between the Hope brothers and the Baring brothers were less turbulent than the Rothschilds, but they failed to transcend their personal differences in the name of fraternal unity.‚Äù ‚Äç Okay, so in other words, and we‚Äôll use the Barings as the counter-example, the Barings were another extremely successful banking family. And they were much more independent. They realized what the Rothschilds realized, if you‚Äôre living under the same roof, if you‚Äôre splitting profits from the same pot, then you tend to have disagreements. So they each went their own way. Less fighting, more peace ‚Äç But they missed out on the exponential value that comes from working together. By 1825 the Rothschild bank was more than 9x bigger than Baring Brothers, despite coming from more obscure origins more recently. And by the way, it‚Äôs not like the Baring Brothers were blowing it. They were the second biggest investment bank in the world! That is the more common way of doing things. ‚Äç This is something I see a lot, people saying oh I would never work with my spouse because I know we would fight or I would never live on the same street as my sister because I know we would fight. Well yeah, I‚Äôm sure you would fight, but guess what? Your relationship would also be closer. ‚Äç Fighting is actually a sign that your relationship is alive and growing. It means you‚Äôre doing things together that matter.

When the Rothschild family eventually breaks up 80 - 90 years later , it ‚Äô s not because they fought too much , in the end they weren ‚Äô t fighting The Rothchilds: at all. They didn‚Äôt care what was happening with other branches of the family. ‚Äç If you want to have a strong relationship, whether familial, romantic, friendly, or professional, it‚Äôs probably going to take working through some differences and conflict. And if you‚Äôre no longer doing that, then your relationship with that person probably isn‚Äôt growing. ‚Äç Okay tangent over. ‚Äç Now in 1836, Nathan dies. ‚Äç Of course, before Nathan dies, he encourages the whole family to maintain unity, just like his father did before he died. And so shortly after he dies, a new agreement is signed, that once again ties the branches of the family together in a profit-sharing structure. ‚Äç At the time of his death, Nathan was by far and away the richest man in the world. His fortune, if you use an inflation calculator, was something like $10 or $15 billion dollars. And that doesn‚Äôt sound THAT impressive, it‚Äôs not as much as Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos. But you have to understand that the world was just a less rich place back then. ‚Äç The numbers are a little sketchy but I have seen it estimated that Nathan had under his personal control nearly a half a percent of global GDP at the time of his death. And that is just a WILD number. If that‚Äôs true, it means he basically owned one 200th of all the wealth on earth. And using that calculator of percentage of GDP, his wealth has never been matched and it‚Äôs not particularly close. ‚Äç Now how does that compare to someone like Montezuma or Mansa Musa or Crassus? Well, I don‚Äôt know. I mean how do you compare them? We don‚Äôt have anything resembling accurate global GDP numbers for those time periods, it‚Äôs impossible to calculate inflation accurately when they were buying just completely different goods from us, and we also don‚Äôt have great numbers around how much money they actually owned. ‚Äç Nathan did live in a time when you could calculate those things, he was buying and building homes that are still standing today in 2019, and so I think Nathan you really can compare to other people going to the present day. And by that percentage of GDP measure, which I think is the one that makes the most sense, he was the richest person to ever have lived so yeah, I find the argument that Nathn was the richest man of all time very compelling. ‚Äç When Nathan dies, James becomes the new de facto head", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/the-rothschilds", "title": "The Rothchilds", "chunk_index": 29, "publication_date": "2019-03-05", "total_chunks_in_doc": 36}}

He‚Äôs the youngest brother, but he‚Äôs the most like Nathan: Energetic, intelligent, and domineering. ‚Äç He takes the family business in a slightly different direction and invests heavily in railroads, which were just starting to come into existence. ‚Äç James leads the family very ably, and Nathan‚Äôs sons are able to take over the London branch in a very capable way. Especially his oldest, Lionel. ‚Äç The world financial market is quite volatile in the mid-1800s, as is the political situation in Europe. There are constant revolutions, as well as constant booms and busts, and those two things are related. One of the great things about the Rothschild family structure is that you have these five branches who are all linked, but their markets are not. ‚Äç So basically at one point or another, every single one of the branches nears bankruptcy and has to be bailed out by the other branches. But that‚Äôs okay. Because if you‚Äôre the French Rothschild bank and there is such a big financial collapse that you only survive by getting bailed out from your brothers or cousins in Vienna and London, guess what happened to all the other major banks in Paris? So you may have only survived by the skin of your teeth, but you‚Äôre in a better competitive position. The recession has essentially wiped the chessboard for you. ‚Äç That‚Äôs basically what happens in 1848. The French Rothschilds are heavily invested in railroad lines, there is a huge financial collapse throughout Europe, especially France, and it especially affects railroads. But guess who‚Äôs basically unscathed by all this? England. So the British Rothschilds come to the rescue of the other banks. ‚Äç Now there is more I could say about the Rothschilds. They‚Äôre a fascinating family and I encourage you to learn more. They have had a far larger impact on the world than most people realize. I mean up until World War 1, they are like the Forrest Gump of global events. No matter what happens, the Rothschilds are involved in some way. ‚Äç They prevent a breakout of war in 1830 and 1848. They help underwrite the creation of multiple states including Belgium, Greece, and Brazil. When the American Civil War breaks out they‚Äôre being petitioned for money by the confederacy and figuring out what to do with their tobacco and cotton investments. ‚Äç When the Franco-Prussian war breaks out they are the diplomatic go-between trying to broker a deal and preserve peace.

Their influence is incredibly far - reaching . ‚Äç But The Rothchilds: something starts to happen. Remember all 5 of Mayer‚Äôs sons were very capable bankers (except Carl). I mean even Carl, poor maligned Carl. Was a pretty solid banker. But in the third generation, it starts to get checkered. It‚Äôs basically half and half, there are two gifted bankers in London, two in Paris, one in Vienna, but the rest are kind of duds. So when James dies in 1868, you‚Äôre basically back to five partners with five hanger-oners who show up and collect paychecks. ‚Äç And this isn‚Äôt good because they really need to be expanding to new markets. And one market in particular was very clearly becoming the new financial powerhouse of the world: The United States. Specifically, New York. ‚Äç Individual Rothschilds did end up moving to the US, but it really wasn‚Äôt until the latter half of the 20th century. They were never able to establish a solid presence in the US and that was probably their single biggest tactical mistake. ‚Äç Their other big mistake is they violate their cardinal virtue. They get disunited. They come unglued. The second generation were all brothers. When they fought, they had tons of shared experience they could lean on. When one of the brothers was getting mad at Carl for something he had done, Carl put things in perspective by saying ‚ÄúWas anything more promised to us when we slept together in one attic room in the Frankfurt Judengasse?‚Äù ‚Äç Which is obviously very touching. And amazing. Go Google Rothschild mansions, go to images and just start clicking around. The Rothschilds built some of the most opulent palaces of all time, which they proceeded to decorate with some of the greatest art collections of all time. ‚Äç And yet these brothers all slept in the same bed in a dingy attic bedroom when they were young. ‚Äç You could see how those brothers would stay united no matter what after what they had been through together. For the next generation, the third generation, there was a way that things were done that also kept them united: You started working with your father as soon as you were able, then when you were in your teenage years you got sent to apprentice with one of your uncles for a few years, then you were given a solo assignment abroad for a little while, and then you came home and helped run one of the main branches. ‚Äç And with this system, you spend a ton of time in the office with your cousins who are also apprenticing there and you‚Äôre meeting your uncles and, you", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/the-rothschilds", "title": "The Rothchilds", "chunk_index": 31, "publication_date": "2019-03-05", "total_chunks_in_doc": 36}}

Partially, I think it‚Äôs just the normal things that you come to expect from rich families. These guys are two generations removed from knowing any kind of struggle whatsoever, they‚Äôve never had to work a day in their life for anything, and so they‚Äôre kind of spoiled. I think there‚Äôs also just some bad luck with the fourth generation, it just so happens that that particular cohort of Rothschilds are not too bright. ‚Äç But there is one other, unlikely element that starts to pull apar the family: College. Suddenly, they‚Äôre not spending their formative years thinking about banking with their cousins, they‚Äôre spending them thinking about girls, booze, and maybe some classes too if time permits with their fellow countrymen. ‚Äç And so the family unity starts fading. The Austrian Rothschilds become more Austrian, the British Rothschilds become more British, the French Rothschilds more French. This really starts when James dies in 1968, but it reaches its nadir in the early 1900s when the firms actually separate and the British, French, and Austrians all decide to remove all profit sharing and go their own way. ‚Äç During this time period, the Rothschild partners are generally working about 3-4 hours per day. They roll in around 11, take a lunch at 12:30, and then leave by 3:30. In stark contrast with Nathan and James, they hardly get involved with the day to day operations, and generally they act more like royalty than bankers. ‚Äç Now the firm can survive for a while on sheer inertia. It‚Äôs huge. The largest investment bank in the world. They‚Äôre completely lacking in innovation, hard and hard work, but they can survive on just being cautious and taking the business that finds them, and so they do. In fact there are stories about ambitious young associates seeing that some country is looking to issue a bond and telling a partner ‚ÄúHey, maybe we should call them up!‚Äù and the partner basically says ‚ÄúWhy?

The German and Austrian Rothschilds have all their assets seized and two are killed in the holocaust . The French Rothschilds have many of their assets seized when Germany invades The Rothchilds: France, though unlike their German cousins, they are able to recover many of them after the war. ‚Äç By the 1950s, the Rothschilds are little more than a name. Many of them still have tens and hundreds of millions of dollars in personal wealth, but the Rothschild banks have faded into obscurity and no longer really matter in terms of global financial markets. ‚Äç But in 1962, things start to turn around. They re-establish links between their institutions and start to modernize their old institutions. Rothschild had broken up into a number of different advisories and firms but they were all brought together under Rothschild & Co. It‚Äôs also during this time that they allow their first non-Rothschild partner, and start to resemble other more normal and frankly modern advisories. ‚Äç In the 70s, there is a rift with one of the French Rothschilds, Jacob. He wants to go all the way, fully modernize and open up Rothschild to outside investment and ownership. This causes a big rift, and he has a contentious departure from the family. ‚Äç He takes his share of the inheritance and opens a firm called RIT. RIT actually does really well and while there are still many wealthy Rothschilds, Jacob now has the distinction of being the only Rothschild billionaire on planet earth. ‚Äç Since the Rothschild firm reunited in the 60s, they‚Äôve made something of a comeback. They‚Äôre no longer the biggest investment bank in the world, not even close. But they are a large, successful financial advisory group. They are relevant again. ‚Äç One of the reasons I wanted to do this podcast and study this family, is I wanted to see how it was possible that a family could retain their wealth and stay relevant for more than 200 years. And I was a little bit bummed out to see that it wasn‚Äôt exactly an unbroken chain of success. ‚Äç Honestly, it has forced me to come to grips with my own mortality a little bit. Not just that I will not live forever, obviously everyone knows that they will die someday. But everything that I build will one day pass away as well. ‚Äç Companies, organizations, and even countries have natural life cycles, just like people do.

Speaking of different episodes, we‚Äôre going to be changing things up a little here in the near future. So stay tuned to How to Take Over the World there is going to be a special announcement in the next couple weeks. ‚Äç Until then, thanks for listening. ‚Äç ‚Äç Okay, so let‚Äôs do the analysis. To what shall we attribute the phenomenal success of Mayer Rothschild. Let me just pull out a few principles: ‚Äç Compound yourself. Maybe you aren‚Äôt going to be able to do this by teaching your children to behave exactly like you, but you can compound your efforts in other ways: Teach others, mentor them. In a word: Be a leader. Leadership is all about learning to compound your efforts through others. Hate losing money. I won‚Äôt harp on this anymore other than to also add protect your downside. When his goods were burned and it shocked and upset him so much, it actually didn‚Äôt set the business back too much. The Rothschilds were experts at hedging against risk. It‚Äôs the reason he sent his sons to the five corners of Europe. With five bases of operation, a single catastrophe couldn‚Äôt wipe you out, and that became crucial in the 1930s when the NAZIs confiscated a good deal of their wealth. Information is key. Capital allocation is competitive. You don‚Äôt make real money by being smart or hardworking or even by being lucky. You make real money by being smarter or harder-working or luckier than anyone else. Rothschild created a lasting advantage for himself by having more information and faster communication. Remember the colored envelopes. So you have to think about what your advantages are. Information is the biggest one. This is why it‚Äôs no secret that Michael Bloomberg, the guy who started Bloomberg news and is the king of financial news, is worth more than $50 billion dollars. If you want to make money, learn something that no one else knows. Start early. Go steady.

The result was a family that, despite squabbles and fights, has stayed mostly united for two hundred years. ‚Äç Integritas. Integrity. Mayer‚Äôs reputation for honesty and integrity followed him his entire life and it is what allowed him to continue to have success and it‚Äôs the reason people were willing to trust him with their money. ‚Äç Industria.

{"text": "Frederick Douglas: Hello, and welcome to how to take over the world. My name is Ben Wilson. I'm excited for this episode on Frederick Douglas. I wanted to get it released while it was somewhat relevant because of some things that are going on right now in the United States and across the world. So here it is, but first a word from our sponsors. The second half of the 19th century in the United States. Has to have been one of the most interesting time periods in human history to live through not necessarily one of the best to live through. Um, it had, you know, the American civil war, which was America's deadliest war by far, there were numerous severe economic downturns. Um, and also just a lot of people had their lives disrupted in, in many difficult ways. And that's because in 1850, the United States was an agricultural nation where most people got around by horse. And by 1900, it was an industrial empire where people are moving around by train and car. So it was certainly an interesting time and interesting times make for interesting people and mid to late 18 hundreds. America was absolutely filled with interesting people. You had incredible inventors like Thomas Edison, who we've talked about as well as Nicola, Tesla and Henry Ford. You had political figures like Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt. You had businessmen who became some of the richest men of all time. Um, when you talk about guys like John D Rockefeller and the Vanderbilt dynasty, JP Morgan, you had incredible artists like Mark Twain and Ralph Waldo Emerson. And so ask yourself of all these Americans of all the people in the world. Who are coming around at this time, who was the most photographed person of the 19th century, because this is the time period when photography is really starting to take off , It's starting to come into its own as a way to document what's going on. What's happening in the news as well as a form of art. So, so who of all these people was the most photographed American of the 19th century. and if you can read the title of the episode of this podcast that you're listening to right now, that's probably not much of a head scratcher. You can probably figure out. That the winner of this title is the statesman orator, abolitionist writer and social reformer, Frederick Douglas, and Frederick Douglas is widely regarded as one of the most influential Americans of all time. And he definitely deserves the title.

That the winner of this title is the statesman orator , abolitionist writer and social reformer , Frederick Douglas , and Frederick Douglas is widely regarded as one of the most influential Americans of all time . And he definitely deserves the title . Although , Frederick Douglas: you know, it's interesting. Sometimes people are inclined to diminish the accomplishments. Uh, not a Frederick Douglas per se, but just of any one individual, right? This is something I've been hearing recently. So they'll say, you know, Hey, personal computers and smartphones still would have been invented if Steve jobs had never come along, which is definitely true. Uh, don't get me wrong. or, you know, you'll hear people say, you know, Rome was ascendant and poised to become this massive Eurasian empire. Whether, whether Caesar had come along or not. And so maybe he doesn't really deserve all this credit for creating the Roman empire, which also, you know, there's some merit to that argument as well. So, I mean, I guess it's a fair reading of history. And so far as it goes, yes, there are trends that affect history that are larger than any one individual. but at the same time time, I mean, you know, I think it was a little bit like saying, you know, Michael Jordan wasn't really that great. I mean, if he hadn't won all those championships, someone would have was like, right. Yes. Someone would have, you know, probably multiple people would have, but the point is he did, you know, he's the one who won all six of those championships. And so to relate it to our current subject, abolitionism was ascending economics. The conditions were changing. There were a number of factors that meant the slavery's days were probably numbered. Slavery was abolished in France in 1794 in England and 1807 in Argentina in 1853 and then Brazil in 1888. So it's difficult to imagine a world in which slavery. Would not have ended in the United States, you know, at least by 1900 but at the same time, you know, slavery doesn't just end itself. Someone has to do it. and Frederick Douglas, along with some other people, you know, obviously most notably Abraham Lincoln, but you know, Frederick Douglas was the preeminent abolitionist, his time. He's the one who sort of got it done. And how did he do it? How did he become that man?

{"text": "he do it ? How did he become that man ? Well , let ' s find out and I have to say , I think this is one of the more interesting episodes , uh , at least for me to research , because I think the keys to Frederick Douglas, his success are in many ways the exact opposite of what you would expect for someone who did what he did. But so let's start at the beginning. Frederick Douglas was born sometime around the year, 18, 17 in Maryland. As Frederick Bailey, the precise date of his birth is unknown. His mother was a mixed race, native American, African, and European. his father was unknown, but many speculate that it was his first master. Uh, as masters having children with their slaves was sadly a quite common practice. And, and I think that is most likely Frederick was separated from his mother as an infant and lived with his maternal grandmother, Betsy Bailey, who was, of course also a slave that arrangement didn't last too long, either. He was separated from her when he was six years old and was sent to the plantation of Colonel Edward Lloyd, who had previously been the governor of Maryland and the United States Senator. a woman named aunt Katie was in charge of the enslaved children there and was very cruel toward Frederick and others. He would often go hungry many times as she would give his portion of food to her own children. And you talk about some of the people on this episode, starting from the bottom and making it to the top. But no one started from the bottom like this. I mean, I can't think of a more disadvantaged situation to come from. He was literally born as property malnourished, separated from his family. And so just suffice it to say, you know, obviously, uh, Frederick Douglas is coming from the lowest of low circumstances. He ended up as the property of a woman named Lucretia ALD who took a special interest in Frederick. She wanted to give him a better life. So Lucretia gave him to her brother, Hugh Auld. Who lived in Baltimore and worked as a ship carpenter, Frederick explains in his autobiography that slaves in the city were often treated significantly better than those who worked on plantations. , in his words, he said, quote, almost a free man compared with a slave on the plantation. Frederick was especially fortunate that all his wife Sophia taught him the alphabet. She was just beginning to teach him three and four letter words. When mr. ALD found out about all this. And put an abrupt stop to it.

{"text": "out about all this . And put an abrupt stop to it . Frederick quotes old as saying to his wife , quote , if you give a Negro an inch , he will take an L , which is an old way of saying , if you give him Frederick Douglas: an inch, he'll take a mile. A Negro should know nothing, but to obey his master to do, as he is told to do learning would spoil the best Negro in the world. Now, if you teach that Negro, how to read, there would be no keeping him. You would forever unfit him to be a slave. He would at once become unmanageable and of no value to his master as to himself. It could do him. No good, but a great deal of harm. It would make him discontented and unhappy. And just as a side note, uh, this man did not say Negro, uh, but you know, I'm, I'm not going to go there. Um, so anytime you hear the word Negro on this podcast, it's because I'm substituting it for a more offensive word. , but mrs. All then had her eyes opened to the dangers of an educated slave and the lesson stopped the books, including the Bible disappeared. And Frederick was from then on carefully watched. And if he was alone for a short period of time, the odds would interrogate him to ensure that. He hadn't been reading. And so Frederick later wrote quote, all this, however was too late. The first step had been taken mistress and teaching me the alphabet had given me the inch and no precaution could prevent me from taking the L. And this is very telling, I think, , of Douglas's character. I mean, you can put yourself in his shoes and really see how, you know, getting those lessons taken away from you. Could crush your spirit you go from this, this terrible situation. You finally get some, some masters who are somewhat benevolent and helpful. And then it all flips on you and you go from having these, these reading lessons and they're taken away from you. And it seems like, man, that's your one shot. You're one glimmer of hope and it's just crushed, just totally shut down. And so you could see how a person would take that as the door slammed in your face. Your one opportunity gone but Frederick didn't see it that way. Listen to the way he later described the confrontation between mr. ALD and his wife quote.

I set out with high hope and a fixed purpose at whatever cost of trouble to learn how to read. , so he didn't give up. And in fact, he used these seemingly insurmountable, uh, roadblocks as inspiration as an opportunity to change strategies. So what he started doing was young Frederick began trading bread to poor white boys that he ran into while completing errands for the alts in exchange for. Vocabulary and spelling lessons from them. He also used old school books from the old sons to develop his skills in reading, writing, and other important things shaped Douglas while he was in Baltimore. Uh, it was in Baltimore that he first heard the word abolition and discovered that there was a growing movement dedicated to emancipation. He also became a strong Christian and saw the ways in which scripture was being used by some to keep slaves pressed, and at the same time by others to call for the end of slavery. Hypocrisy displayed by plantation owners who profess to be Christian, , became a central component of his anti-slavery lectures later on, uh, in the appendix of his autobiography. He wrote quote, I love the pure peaceable and impartial Christianity of Christ. I therefore hate the corrupt slave holding women, whipping cradle, plundering, partial, and hypocritical Christianity of this land. Indeed. I can see no reason, but the most deceitful one for calling the religion of this land, Christianity, I look upon it as the climax of all misnomers, the boldest of all frauds and the grossest of all libels. And as you can see, as an orator, as, and as a writer, Douglas was not given to understatement. and that was one of his calling cards. One of the things that he was known for is. He said things the way that he saw him, uh, even if it made people uncomfortable and even if the language, can strike you as aggressive at times. And it definitely can. It definitely does. One of the turning points in Douglass's life happened when he was about 12 years old, one day he heard some little boys reciting pieces from a book that was widely used in American school rooms in the first quarter of the 19th century.

George Washington, Benjamin Franklin Napoleon Bonaparte. Socrates Cicero and so on. , if I can say so the order was basically Frederick Douglas is how to take over the world. It was his chance , , to learn the secrets of the great ones. these selections inspired him to seek Liberty for himself and others, but also helped him develop the oratory and rhetorical skills to be successful once he was a free man. And this is another big lesson that we can take away from Douglas. The story. If I can say so myself is that even this man who was born in abject poverty, who was born as property, the way that he made it out, the way that he achieved greatness. Was by studying the lives of the great ones. So I, you know, not to Pat myself on the back, but I do think it validates the premise of this podcast a little bit. And I think, you know, it's for the same reasons that inspired, you know, everyone else who had these sort of heroes, , I think that. Frederick Douglas was like competitive with them. I think he reads this Colombian order. And as he's reading these speeches and these writings, he thinks to himself. I could do that. I could write like that. I could speak like that. The most influential piece that Douglas read was called between a master and slave in the story. A slave has been recaptured after a third, attempted to escape the master. Borates the slave for in gratitude and disobedience. The slave is then allowed to respond and definitely refutes all of the masters arguments, Douglas recounts quote, the master was vanquished to every turn in the argument. And seeing himself to be thus vanquished. He generously and meekly emancipates the slave with his best wishes for his prosperity Douglas at a very young age had learned that literacy and the grasp of language would be key to gaining his own freedom and more broadly the emancipation of Olin slave people. his own master had unwittingly taught him that lesson. And after reading the dialogue between the master and slave, that solidified that lesson for him, he wrote later, quote, I have found that to make a contented slave, it is necessary to make a thoughtless one.

He must be made to feel that slavery is right and he can be brought to that only when he sees us to be a man. I love this quote because it exposes so brilliantly, the fundamental underpinnings of the institution of slavery, the only way to truly sustain a system that is built upon treating other people like cattle. Is to somehow convince those people that they truly are cattle strip them of their humanity material needs and comforts food, working, clothes, living conditions, clothing, uh, those could be pretty easily controlled by the slave owners, but what was more difficult to control was the enslaved persons, mind and soul to darken his moral and mental vision as a Fredrick, Douglas wrote reading and writing were Douglas is ways out and he thought the way out for every enslaved person. but he also knew that that couldn't do it alone. Right. he was going to have to take action. He was going to have to run away. When Frederick was 15 years old, Thomas, all the wife of Frederick's previous owner Lucretia took him back from Hugh, after a number of deaths and family quarrels. Frederick worked on Thomas' plantation for only a few months, but while he did, he began standing up for himself and for other slaves, In Thomas and Thomas Alz words, Douglas was ruined in 1833. The 16 year old Frederick was sent to a notorious slave breaker named Edward Covey. Basically a slave breaker was what it sounded like. It was a plantation owner known for being particularly cruel and menacing. And slave owners who had rebellious slaves could send them there for training. , and essentially that training is just extremely harsh and cruel punishment, to, to have this laser turn, more docile, more compliant, more obedient than they were before. So, and beat Douglas on an almost daily basis. The whippings were so frequent that his wounds would never have time to sufficiently heal before the next beating. , he also made Douglas feel as though he was consistently being watched and that whatever he did could never truly escape the knowledge of Covey. This laser worked unflaggingly from sunrise to sunset with only five minute breaks for meals.

And Frederick grabs Covey's throat and tells him that he has done being treated like an animal Covey calls on another nearby slave to help him. But the other slave refuses, they fought and argue for hours, but eventually Frederick broke the slave breaker. , he would later described this as a turning point in my career as a slave, this fight reinvigorated, fake Frederick. Um, it strengthened his resolve. You know, he had been somehow put in even worse conditions than he had been born into by being sent to the slave breaker. But you know, this is strengthened his resolve that, Hey, I can break the slave breaker. You know, it's like, no matter where they put me, no matter where they send me. I can find a way he was then hired out to a man named William Freeland, a of whom Frederick said, quote, I will give mr. Freeland the credit of being the best master I ever had. Although he added till I became my own master, mr. Freeland was less pious than the slave breaker Covey, but he was much more reasonable and fair to his slaves. the work was still obviously difficult and tiring, but Freeland was not deceitful or unnecessarily cruel in these circumstances. Frederick began holding Sunday school classes to teach slaves how to read the new Testament. Although this was initially a relatively discreet operation word, quickly spread to the surrounding plantations. And soon over 40 slaves were regularly attending the classes. This infuriated, the neighboring plantation owners. And one day they infiltrated a meeting armed with clubs and rocks. Discontinuing the classes permanently, this turn of events, obviously left Frederick feeling like there was only one path for him to take and it was time to try for his escape.

When he feels Fredrick is aiming to escape, which he was, but it was too late. He had accumulated enough money to make his attempt. In 1837 Frederick fell in love with a free black Baltimore woman named Anna Marie Marie empowered, Frederick to escape and helped finance his getaway. using false papers and traveling by train and Steamboat. He arrived in New York city. He purposely shared few details of his escape in order to ensure that the means he used would not be cut off by slaveholders and slave catchers on his arrival in New York city. He said this quote, there is scarcely anything in my experience about which I could not give a more satisfactory answer. A new world had opened upon me. If life is more than breath and the quick round of blood, I lived more in one day than in a year of my slave life. It was a time of joyous excitement, which words can be tamely describe. And that's, I mean, it's kind of incredible to think of what that must've felt like to live your whole life as a slave. And then one day, boom, everything changes in your free man. He and Anna Marie settled in new Bedford, Massachusetts and abolition, a center that was packed with former slaves and there, he adopted the name of Douglas inspired by the poem, the lady of the Lake by Walter Scott. One of the protagonists of the poem is Lord James Douglas, a Scotsman who fought for freedom and independence from the English. The newly minted Fredrick Douglas became a licensed preacher and quickly launched into his speaking career. One of the reasons Douglas was so influential was his ability to reveal the cruel methods by which masters controlled their slaves. The showing the dehumanization that slavers had to revert to in order to support an institution like slavery. So for instance, in his autobiography, he describes the following quote. The slave is made to be disgusted by freedom by allowing him to see only the abuse of it carried out in other things. For instance, a slave loves molasses. So he steals some, his master in many cases, goes off to town and buys a large quantity.

Douglas helped northerners see slavery less as a distant issue happening far away and more as Frederick Douglas: something that was happening right in their backyard in the South to be successful. The things you say have to have relevance, have to have meaning to people. And that's why he was able to do, he was able to connect his own story to theirs. And so he had this, this unique storytelling ability that came from. His unique experience of having been a slave, having lived that life. but also raw ability, you know, his grasp of language, , his rhetorical skill, it says his charisma, which he had in abundance. Naturally his breakthrough moment came in August of 1841. Douglas spoken anti-slavery convention in Nantucket, Massachusetts, a prominent and influential abolitionist was also in attendance, a journalist and publisher by the name of William Lloyd Garrison. He described his experience, hearing Douglas, speak like this. He said, quote, I shall never forget his first speech at the convention. The extraordinary emotion and excited in my own mind. I think I never hated slavery. So intensely is at that moment there stood one in physical proportion and stature, commanding and exact in intellect. Originally endowed in natural eloquence, a prodigy in soul manifestly created, but a little lower than the angels. Yeah, a slave I, a fugitive slave gambling for his safety capable. Hi attainments as an intellectual and moral being, needing nothing but a comparatively small amount of cultivation to make him an ornament to society and a blessing to his race by the law of the land, by the voice of the people, by the terms of the slave, the code, he was only a piece of property, a beast of burden, a chattel personal, nevertheless garrison's words. Show why Douglas was so vehemently. Venerated by many of his contemporaries, but also hated by many defenders of the institution of slavery. You know, the, the institution of slavery was, you know, as mentioned, deliberately designed. The dehumanize people and, and many people tried to argue that it was good for slaves. for example, John C. Calhoun, the seven vice president of the United States, , said an 1837 quote, never before has the black race of central Africa from the Dawn of history to the present day. Attained a condition.

And in the course of a few generations , he has grown up under the fostering care of our institutions . Douglas was a living embodiment of everything that plantation Frederick Douglas: owners said that black people were not, he was independent, intelligent well-spoken and civilized. And he didn't become all those things because of slavery. He became all those things. In spite of the horrors that slavery had subjected him to, so after this breakthrough moment, Frederick Douglas goes on the circuit. He travels about six months of the year. Speaking about abolition, unsurprisingly, this eloquence got him quite a name and a reputation bigger and bigger crowds began to show up for his speeches. And as his notoriety grew. So did the threat of his recapture. You know, even as he's becoming more famous, there's always the possibility that he could have to be captured and go back to his old life. He traveled to Ireland and great Britain in 1845 in order to escape the possibility that the acclaim would draw all his attention and get him tossed back into slavery , while in the British Isles, he spoke to pack churches, crowded to suffocation as he put it. His messages were so powerful that audience members actually provided him the funds to purchase his freedom from alt. after returning to the United States, a few years later, he continued his activism. , he was very much a free thinker and didn't shy away from speaking up when he disagreed, even with those who were on his side. , he said, quote, I prefer to be true to myself, even at the hazard of incurring the ridicule of others rather than to be false and to incur my own importance. And so eventually Frederick Douglas, um, even kind of split with William Lloyd Garrison, this famous abolitionist who really helps him get his start and part because while Garrison argued that the us constitution was pro slavery. And so needed to be destroyed Douglas asserted that it could and should be used in the effort to dismantle slavery. Perhaps Douglas, his most famous speech was given at an American independence day celebration in Rochester, New York in 1852. It starts out as what you would expect for a 4th of July speech. He begins by honoring the founding fathers and their commitment to the rights. Um, so beautifully outlined in the declaration of independence, you know, life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. But the tone begins to change when he starts to ask quote, fellow citizens. Pardon me? Allow me to ask, why am I called upon to speak here today?

And am I therefore called upon to bring our humble offering to the national altar and to confess the benefits and express devout gratitude for the blessings resulting from your independence to us, he then goes on to point out that black people in America, particularly those who are enslaved did not have access to life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness later on, he says, quote, what to the American slave is your 4th of July. To him. Your celebration is a sham, your boasted, Liberty, and unholy license, your national greatness, swelling vanity. Your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless you're denounced creation of tyrants, brass fronted, impudence, your shouts of Liberty and equality hollow mockery. Your prayers and hymns your sermons and Thanksgivings with all your religious parade and solemnity are to him. Mere bombast fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy, a thin veil to cover up crimes, which would disgrace a nation of savages. So there you have it again. I mean, he can have a sharp tongue, right. Douglas was bold. He was very unafraid to speak the uncomfortable truth. And that truth was that northerners needed to be uncomfortable about the fact that slavery still existed. In their country. you know, as previously mentioned, instead of ripping the foundational principles of the nation, he used them to say, look, these ideals are great, but let's make them more than some pie in the sky. Daydream. Let's look at those who are barred from taking part of those liberties. And let's see what we can do to change that. Let's see what we can do to bring them in. and because he emerged from the world of slavery, he had every right to talk about how evil it was prominent white, Northern abolitionists, like Garrison were extremely important for a variety of reasons. , but none of them could speak with the clarity that came from truly knowing firsthand. The foundations of slavery and what it was like. and so by the time of the civil war, Douglas is one of the most famous black men in the country has profound eloquence impactful speeches, elucidated the condition of black Americans.

Giving a memorable and impactful speech there. He became the first African American nominated for vice president in 1872. He was the editor of various news publications and his autobiographies were bestsellers. he was known as one of the foremost civil rights advocates of his time. If Abraham Lincoln was the great emancipator Frederick Douglas was right behind him. Although I don't think that that ever quite sat right with Frederick Douglass on April 14th, 1876. Frederick Douglas attended the dedication of the emancipation Memorial, a statue of president Lincoln, holding the emancipation proclamation. And standing next to a freed slave who was just beginning to stand. Uh, you may have seen the statue because it's recently been on the news because some people are trying to tear it down. And Douglas was asked to speak at this dedication, and you can imagine that most people were expecting it to be a tribute to Abraham Lincoln who had recently been assassinated just a few years previous. And instead Douglas gives what can be that's described. Has a fair and nuanced take on Abraham Lincoln. He said, quote, truth compels me to admit even here in the presence of the monument, we have erected to his memory. Abraham Lincoln was not in the fullest sense of the word either our man or our model in his interests, in his associations, in his habits of thought and in his prejudices. He was a white man though. Mr. Lincoln shared the prejudices of his fellow white country, man, against the Negro. It is hardly necessary to say that in his heart of hearts. He loved and hated slavery. So, you know, that is a fair and honest take. , he of course does give him the credit at the end that he loaded and hated slavery. But I mean, giving a fair and honest take this Memorial to him is a little bit like giving a fair and honest take of someone at their funeral. I think most people would say that the occasion calls for some untempered praise. Which brings us to one of Frederick Douglass's most important and least expected virtues ambition. It's clear from reading the speech that Frederick Douglas thought that he, Frederick Douglas was the true leader of the abolition movement. Not Lincoln Douglas, like to be in charge.

If you ' re imagining that Frederick Douglas did Frederick Douglas: it all because he was pure hearted and wanted the best for humanity. I have bad news for you. I mean, that was definitely part of the consideration. Don't get me wrong. He was trying to do the right thing for sure. He passionately believed in ending slavery, especially because he had suffered so cruelly under it, but he, we have to acknowledge, he was also a type, a person who wanted to win. He wanted to be powerful and famous. And my main takeaway from his life is. That's okay. for example, let's go back to why open the episode with Douglas was the most photographed American of the 19th century. The first photograph ever taken happened in 1826, and photography really only started to gain a foothold in society. In the mid 18 hundreds cameras were not close to as ubiquitous back then as they are today. So it was a big deal to have your photograph taken and an even bigger deal to have it taken. You know, multiple times the process very involved, portrait photographs were reserved for elites and they took a long time and it was a big process. So why was Douglas the most photographed individual of the 19th century? Well, one thing is for certain it wasn't an accident, right? It didn't just happen. , Douglas intentionally did it. He viewed the camera as a tool to spread the plight of enslaved people to the masses. And he made sure to use that tool. he said that he believed photography, quote, highlighted the essential humanity of its subjects. And so he wanted to highlight the humanity of a freed slave and in, so doing highlight the humanity. Of of all African Americans. And if you look at the photos taken of Douglas, , he's always, well-dressed his wavy hair and thick beard are well-groomed and dapper. He sits in front of a dark single color background. He never holds any props or appears with anyone or anything else. He wanted all the attention to be on his face. As he put it, quote the face of a fugitive slave in many of the photos, he stares directly into the camera, which was actually not common at the time. Usually they, uh, you know, you can think of an old photograph they're staring off camera. Right. I mean, you can go look up one of these photographs. I posted one too.

I mean , he just , he looks Frederick Douglas: awesome. And, um, and part of what he was doing with these photographs was definitely exactly what he said. Right. He was trying to bring humanity to this population of African Americans. But if I might be so bold as to propose, he also, who liked to look awesome and photographs for the same reason that you or I, or anyone likes to look awesome and photographs, right. It's cool. It makes us feel good. He, it was part of, it was for personal vanity and his ambition. And the thing is though it worked, it worked not only to bring him personal theme, but it also worked to bring humanity to African-Americans and to push forward the cause of emancipation and abolition. And so I think that's the big takeaway is that he married. His ambition to the cause that he really believed in there were other times where his ambition had more ambiguous outcomes. Like when Douglas endorsed the primary opponent of John Mercer, Langston, and African-American Republican running for Congress, um, Douglas chalked it up to principal. He said, look, I don't see color. And this other guy, you know, I agree with him on the issues. , but almost everyone agrees that that is not true. , what was really going on was that he and Langston were personal rivals when it came to leading the African American civil rights movement. And so, you know, he could be petty. It was a little bit petty. What he did kind of talk smack about Abraham Lincoln at the unveiling of a statue dedicated to Abraham Lincoln. and everyone that I've talked about on this podcast could be petty. We expect great conquers like Caesar Napoleon to be petty, to have egos. We also expect it from inventors, scientists and artists, um, you know, Edison, Einstein, and Picasso. It's not a revelation. It's not news to us. These guys had big egos and wanted to be on top. But I think sometimes we expect that great social champions will be different. We expect them to be the pure hearted altruists right. But that's just not the case. And the truth is that the pure hurted altruists as insofar as there are some do not accomplish a 10th of what self-interested men like Frederick Douglas do.

And so I think that ' s an equally important lesson . Frederick Douglas consciously channeled his ambition Frederick Douglas: into something beneficial. He said, quote, a man is worked upon by what he works on. He may carve out his circumstances, but his circumstances will carve him out as well. Basically. Douglas is saying that what you put your time and effort into will shape you. It's important that we think carefully. About the things that we do each day for good or for bad. And if we're ambitious, I think that's great, but make sure that you're channeling that ambition towards something productive, something that will reflect back towards you and help make you a better person. The last takeaway from Douglass's life is that he refused to take the path of least resistance. He understood that without deliberate, purposeful action and diligent effort, nothing was going to be accomplished. As a slave, he wasn't going to just stumble into literacy and he wasn't just going to stumble into freedom. Escaping bondage was not going to happen if he fantasized about it enough and abolishing an institution and a practice that had been deeply ingrained in American society since before the country began was also not just going to happen on its own. If you want something in life, you've got to demand it. You're going to have to struggle for it. You're going to have to agitate some people. You're going to have to rub some people the wrong way. You create your own progress. And so I'll leave you with Douglas, his own words. He said, if there is no struggle, there is no progress. Those who profess the favor of freedom and yet depreciate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the ground. They want rain without thunder enlightening. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters. This struggle may be a moral one, or it may be a physical one, or it may be both moral and physical, but it must be a struggle power concedes, nothing without a demand. It never did. And it never will. That does it for this episode of how to take over the world.

I'm doing a series on the American founders, and I am convinced that there are only three founding fathers of the United States who were truly indispensable. There are many who made extremely valuable contributions, but only three without whom I think the revolution would have failed. And those three are George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and Benjamin Franklin. I don't mean to downplay the contributions of men like Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, John Jay, Benjamin Rush, John Adams. I could go on. There were many great men in that generation. There were giants on the earth in those days, to paraphrase the Bible. But only those three were genuinely indispensable, I think. And of those three, I agree with Teddy Roosevelt that Alexander Hamilton was the greatest. I've been really looking forward to this episode, and one of the reasons is, The musical Hamilton. I'm really glad that the musical has popularized the character of Alexander Hamilton. But a quibble I have with it is that I think perhaps it doesn't convey the true greatness of the man. He was central to the dealings of the There was a great French diplomat named Talleyrand, and he was central to the dealings of Napoleonic Europe. This is a man who knew all the great generals and heads of state in the late 18th and early 19th century. And he said, and I quote, I consider Napoleon Fox and Hamilton, the three greatest men of our epic. And he said, I consider Napoleon Fox and Hamilton, the three greatest men of our epic Fox was a very prominent English wig politician. And if I were forced to decide between the three, I would give without hesitation, the first place to Hamilton. And that is like a pretty amazing quote. This is someone who knew and intimately worked with Napoleon. Uh, and. And that is like a pretty amazing quote. I mean, this is someone who was intimately familiar with Napoleon, who knew him extremely well, worked with him daily for a long time. And he thought that Alexander Hamilton, who he also knew well, as we shall see, was even more brilliant than Napoleon. In many ways, Hamilton is the American Napoleon.

In many ways , Hamilton is the American Napoleon . Both were short and thin with reddish Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: hair. Both were brilliant artillery captains. Both were from small islands off the coast of the country. They would end up calling their home. Both were notorious flirts and womanizers. Both were extremely energetic. Both had Titanic egos and were obsessed with earning military glory. Both implemented sweeping reforms to their country's governments. They even died at nearly the same age. Napoleon was 51 and Hamilton was 49. When you read about Hamilton, if you have, When you read about Hamilton, if you have any experience or knowledge of Napoleon, you are just constantly reminded of the similarities between the two. There are even more commonalities that I will point out, but I find one of their differences to be illuminating. Of the two, only Alexander Hamilton was ever able to speak accentless French. You know, they have all these similarities. I think actually one of their differences is very telling and very funny, which is that of the two, only Alexander Hamilton was able to speak French without an accent. I'm not the first person to make this observation. Many people at the time used it as sort of a slur, um, to say, you know, Hamilton, he has these Napoleonic ambitions. And many people since then have noted the similarities between the two men. Historian Henry Adams wrote, from the first to the last words he wrote, I always read the same Napoleonic kind of adventuredom. So, why do I think Alexander Hamilton was the most indispensable, the greatest founding father of the United States? Stay tuned to find out. That's what this series is all about. I will caveat this by saying that Washington is a very close second. They were a brilliant partnership, and without either one, things would have gone very differently. And my main argument is that Hamilton is underappreciated, Even after the musical, not that Washington was overrated or anything like that. I think he more than merits his place at the center of the American pantheon. Okay, so let's see what made Hamilton so great and why his con Okay, so let's see what made Hamilton so great and why his contributions were so vital. I'll note that my main source is Alexander Hamilton by Ron Chernow, but I'll also pull a couple quotes from the biography written by his son, John C. Hamilton. With all that said, let's get into it.

Chernow writes that he was slight and thin shouldered, and distinctly Scottish in appearance, with a florid complexion, reddish brown hair, and sparkling violet blue eyes. He was short, very handsome, but kind of delicate. Some even described him as feminine looking. He grew up on Nevis, and also on the nearby island of St. Croix, where his mother moved the family after being abandoned by Hamilton's father, James Hamilton. These were small islands that were unimportant in and of themselves, but were very important economic centers. They were huge producers of sugarcane. Slavery was absolutely central in both Nevis and St. Croix. Slavery was absolutely central in both Nevis and St. Croix. If you go somewhere like Virginia in the late 17 hundreds, slavery is very important to, to slavery is very important to the functioning of the economy, but most people did not own slaves. Only the rich moneyed class actually had these largest states. That were worked by slaves. But that was not the case in Nevis and St. Croix. Even a poor widow like Rachel Hamilton owned a handful of slaves. The whole society was built around slavery. Alexander Hamilton's mother, Rachel, had been married previously to a man named Mr. Levin, and he had, and she had never obtained a divorce so that technically Alexander and James Hamilton Jr., his", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/alexander-hamilton-part-1-and-2", "title": "Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2", "chunk_index": 2, "publication_date": "2024-06-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 75}}

Levin , and he had , and she had never obtained a divorce so that technically Alexander and James Hamilton Jr . , his Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: brother, were illegitimate. Though Rachel and James Hamilton lived together for 15 years, so it's not like he was born fatherless. As a child, he wouldn't have felt like an illegitimate child. You know, he had a father and, you know, he had a father and a mother in the household. Um, sometimes it was portrayed by his political enemies that he was the son of a prostitute. Um, but that's, that's not the case. When Hamilton was 13 years old, he and his mother contracted yellow fever, they laid together on small cots in a cramped room. And while young Alexander eventually recovered, his mother died right there next to him, perhaps even in his embr They laid together on small cots in a cramped room, and while young Alexander eventually recovered, his mother died right there next to him. Perhaps they were even touching as she passed away. With their father out of the picture, he and his brother James Jr. were sent to live with their cousin, who committed suicide shortly thereafter. And they were then separated, and Alexander was sent to live with a rich and prominent merchant, Thomas Stevens. Hamilton became best friends with Stevens son, Edward Stevens. The boys were soulmates. Later in their lives, Stevens would write to Hamilton of, quote, those vows of eternal friendship which we have so often mutually exchanged. And that is a very intense friendship for these boys of only 14 years old, to be swearing oaths of eternal loyalty to each other. It reminds me of the relationship between Genghis Khan and his blood brother, Jamukha. These very powerful men often form these very intense friendships when they're young. Anyway, many people think that they were, in fact, not just friends, But half brothers, so this guy that he went to go live with Thomas Stevens, he showed an enduring interest in the welfare of Alexander Hamilton. His son very closely resembled Alexander Hamilton. So, so Hamilton and his friend, Edward Stevens, supposedly, when people saw them, they were just taken aback. They go, Whoa, you two best friends look exactly alike. And, um, and so that's like kind of compelling evidence that, that maybe And so that's pretty compelling evidence that maybe Thomas Stevens, uh, was in fact Hamilton's father. Add to that the fact that James Hamilton, for whatever reason, didn't show a lot of interest.

{"text": "compelling evidence that maybe Thomas Stevens , uh , was in fact Hamilton ' s father . Add to that the fact that James Hamilton , for whatever reason , didn ' t show a lot of interest . You know , they continued to write a little bit , Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: uh, but he never came to see him in America. Um, it's just weird that when his son was having all this magnificent success in the United States, he never took more of an interest where this Thomas Stevens guy kind of did. So, so that's another data point. In fact, in the 1800s, this was taken as fact rather than a conspiracy theory. Timothy Pickering wrote, It was generally understood that Hamilton was an illegitimate son of a gentleman of the name of Stevens. And Henry Cabot Lodge wrote that, Every student of the period is familiar with the story which oral tradition has handed down, that Hamilton was the illegitimate son of a rich West Indian planter or merchant, generally supposed to have been Mr. Stevens, the father of Hamilton's early friend and school fellow. And this also explains some things in that, James Hamilton was kind of a lazy, feckless ne'er do well. He could never get things to work, and he wasn't very enterprising, he wasn't a go getter, Whereas Thomas Stevens was enterprising and brilliant, just like Alexander Hamilton. So, I believe this secret parentage story, although of course, Unless someone does some grave digging and genetic testing, we'll likely never know the truth of his parentage. Even as a young boy, Hamilton had worked to put together an impressive library, which included Plutarch's Lives, the poetry of Alexander Pope, and a French edition of Machiavelli's The Prince. And why a French edition? Well, his mother was of French Huguenot extraction, and so Hamilton spoke more or less fluent French from his childhood. And as we shall see, this came in handy later for Hamilton, his ability to speak fluent French. Now, I have relayed the events of his childhood in a fairly straightforward manner, but it's worth noting how difficult of a childhood this was. Chernow summarizes it well. He says, A grim catalogue of disasters had befallen these two boys between 1765 and 1769. Their father had vanished, their mother had died, their cousin and supposed protector had committed bloody suic their cousin and supposed protector had committed blu protector had committed bloody suicide, and their aunt, uncle, and grandmother had all died. James, 16, and Alexander, 14, were now left alone, largely friendless and penniless.

At every step in their rootless , topsy turvy existence , they had been surrounded by failed , broken , and bittered people . Their short lives had been shadowed by a stupefying sequence of Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: bankruptcies, marital separations, deaths, scandals, and disinheritance. Okay, so, it is an extremely difficult childhood. But despite these difficult circumstances, Alexander Hamilton thrived as soon as he was given the opportunity. He received a big boost to his education when, at the age of 14, he was apprenticed to the merchant business Beekman and Kruger. And so, even though he is in a faraway island, Hamilton gets a top rate mercantile education. He is basically in charge of their business in St. Croix. He has to monitor and oversee deals of timber, food, barrels, iron, lime, rope, bricks, cattle, and slaves. You know, these are general merchants. They trade in everything. And so Hamilton gets to handle all the accounts, make purchases, make sales, and see all the figures and keep track of them. He actually has almost exactly the same first job as John D. Rockefeller. Hamilton had a great memory, was great with numbers, and was extremely hardworking and energetic. He does really well in his first job, and shows himself to have a top notch mind for business. Now the firm was actually based out of New York, and the partners were frequently gone for long stretches, so Hamilton gets very used to running things himself. And is actually annoyed when one of the partners, Kruger, returns to St. Croix to oversee things himself for a little bit. And one of the defining attributes of Hamilton was that he always thought that he was the smartest person in the room, and he chafed. under any sort of oversight or authority. He hated to be subservient to anyone. He always wanted to be in control. And, you know, when you look at his record, you understand why he always thought he was the smartest person in the room. He usually was. And, uh, and so this starts very, very early. He wants to be the man. He wants to be the person in charge. And he recognizes within himself, this Titanic ambition he thinks that, you know, he, he has the ability to be the man, to, to really accomplish things in life. And he just wants the opportunity to show it. We have this amazing letter that he wrote to his friend, uh, and we have this amazing letter that he wrote to Edward Stevens, that guy who's his, his close friend and maybe half brother.

So that's like I I I love that letter that Hamilton is pining for a war at 14 years old. And you see just how he's chomping at the bit to distinguish himself. And, uh, and he, he kind of intuits that if there's a war, that would be an opportunity for him to show how smart and capable he is and distinguish himself and rise in the ranks. Interestingly, his big break comes the same way it came for Napoleon. So a huge hurricane comes and completely devastates a number of Caribbean islands, including Nevis and St. Croix. And Hamilton, in the wake of this huge natural disaster, writes a fantastic essay where he describes the storm and offers reflections on life in its wake. I'll share a couple passages so you can get a feel for him and his writing style. Here's what he writes. Good God, what horror and destruction! It's impossible for me to describe good God, what horror and destruction. It's impossible for me to describe or you to form any idea of it. It seemed as if a total disillusion of nature was taking place. The roaring of the sea and wind, fiery meteors flying about it in the air, the prodig the prodigious glare of almost perpetual lightning, the crash of the falling houses, the ear piercing shrieks of the distressed, were sufficient to strike astonishment into angels.

Where now , O vile worm , Where now , O vile worm , Is Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: all thy boasted fortitude and resolution? What has it become of thine arrogance and self sufficiency? Why dost thou tremble and stand aghast? How humble, how helpless, how contemptible, you now appear. And for why? The jarring of elements, the discord of clouds? Oh, impotent, presumptuous fool, how durst thou offend that omnipotence? whose nod alone were sufficient to quell the destruction that hovers over thee, or crush thee into atoms. But see, the Lord relents. He hears our prayers. The lightning ceases. The winds are appeased. The warring elements are reconciled, and all things promise peace. The darkness is dispelled, and drooping nature revives at the approaching dawn. Yet hold, O vain mortal, check thy ill timed joy. Art thou so selfish to exult because thy lot is happy in a season of universal woe? Hast thou no feeling for the miseries of thy fellow creatures? Art thou incapable of the soft pangs of sympathetic, of sympathetic, sorrow? Look around thee and shudder at the view. See desolation and ruin where'er thou turn thine eyes. See thy fellow creatures pale and lifeless, their bodies mangled, their souls snatched into eternity, Unexpecting, alas, perhaps unprepared. Hark their bitter groans of distress. O ye who revel in affluence, see the afflictions of humanity, and bestow your superfluity to ease them. Say not, we have suffered also, and thence withhold your compassion. , what are your sufferings compared to those? Ye have still more than enough left. Act wisely, sucker the miserable, and lay up a treasure in heaven. Okay, so, maybe it's a bit overwrought and a bit heavy handed with the moralizing, But, it's excellent prose, especially for a teenager, especially in these far flung islands. This essay takes St. Croix by storm. No pun intended. And well to do men start inquiring after the author, Hamilton, had published it anonymously. And when people find out that a teenager has written this, they think, Okay, a top notch writer like this shouldn't be stuck here on this island, and they raise a fund to send him to the United States so he can receive a college education. So, in 1772, at the age of 17, Hamilton sets off for Boston.

So start a blog, a Twitter account, a podcast, a newsletter, anything like that. It lets people know how smart and capable you are. It attracts people who are inclined toward your interests or your mode of thinking and it has the added benefit. That in articulating what matters most to you, you have to think about and clarify and discover what matters most to you. For me personally, this podcast has been an exceptional way to find my people, people who believe what I do think like I do are interested in what I'm interested in and it has opened doors. I wouldn't have believed when I started this podcast and it's not a coincidence that both Hamilton and Napoleon broke through in this way. If you forgot, Napoleon wrote a political pamphlet that attracted the attention of The government in Paris called the directory. And that was how he got his first big military appointments. So I think for anyone learning to write well is one of those. So I think for anyone learning to write well as one of those foundational skills that enables everything else that you do. So get your thoughts out into the world. It creates a great surface area. Also for luck, it creates opportunities to be discovered. And leap your career progress forward. It's, it's just one of the most high impact things that you can do for Hamilton's work habits. For Hamilton's work habits is daily habits. We don't know much. very much. But we do know that he rose early, drank strong coffee, and then according to Chernow, quote, seated himself at his table where he would remain six, seven, or eight hours. So breakfast was basically just coffee at his, so breakfast was basically just coffee at this point in his life. That changes a little bit once he gets married, but for now that's how he works. I haven't found any direct references to him being a light eater, but if you're waking up, drinking coffee, and then sitting at your desk for a marathon eight hour stretch without getting up from the table, then I think. You probably qualify as a light eater, you know, it's not just when or how you eat that matters.

He goes first to Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: Boston, and then proceeds from there to New York. He tries to get into college at Princeton, which was then, and still is, one of America's most prestigious universities, but they won't let him in because he's too young. So, I guess at this point I have to mention that there is controversy around his birth year. So Hamilton has a very turbulent background. He's basically an orphan. You know, his mother dies when he's young and then he's passed from family to family to family. He's from the small Island. Probably there weren't good records kept anyway. So. We're actually not totally sure of his birth year. So he thinks it's 1757. Um, and that's what he tells everyone that he's born in 1757, thereby making him 15 years old. There's actually pretty compelling evidence that he was actually born in 1755. So he's actually 17 years old. And so that is the, uh, and so that is the date that I have been using. Um, so that is the date I have been using, but anyway, he, he thinks he's two years younger than, than most people think he actually was. So the point is he's trying to get into Princeton as a 15 year old. And they say, no. That's too young. And he brings up the example of another young man who had been admitted to Princeton at a young age, just a few years previously, a young man named Aaron Burr. In fact, at this point, Hamilton might have heard the story from Burr himself. They might've already met, but Burr was a well connected American, whereas Hamilton was a penniless foreigner. And so he is rejected from Princeton. And he ends up going to King's college in New York, the institution that would eventually become known as Columbia university. Now, Hamilton was always very good at making friends and he does so right away. The fact that he is poor and a foreigner doesn't stop him. He quickly gains a group of very close friends and begin studies on his own in preparation for college. You know, one of the reasons that he's so good at making friends, even though like he doesn't know anyone, he's kind of starting from zero. Is he's very charismatic.

Even when they just first meet him, they realize that he's unlike anyone they've ever met. You know, the other kind of defining thing about Hamilton that is difficult to capture is his frenetic pace. There's a good quote from Cherna who writes a copious note taker. He left behind in minute hand in exercise book in which he jotted down passages from the lion in which he jotted down passages from the Iliad in Greek. Took extensive notes on geography and history and compiled detailed chapter synopses from the books of Genesis and Revelation. As if wanting to pack every spare moment with achievement, he also found time to craft poetry and write the prologue and epilogue of an unspecified play performed by a local detachment of British soldiers. Okay, so, okay, so he's doing everything. Like, he's, he's just got these few months until school starts and he teaches himself Greek and, um, and even reads the Iliad in Greek and, and takes all these notes and he's writing poetry, he's writing plays, He's studying all the prerequisite materials for college. Like he's, he's just doing everything. He had this incredible energy to just work, work, work, and get an unbelievable amount done in a very short amount of time at King's college. When he does enter, he's a star student, never makes trouble, gets great grades, wakes up before 6am and just has this startling capacity for work. And not just work, he's very social, he goes to parties, he's an incredibly hard worker, but he's not a stick in the mud. He uses all his time extremely productively, whether that is for work or whether that is for entertainment. No waste. He founds a weekly club dedicated to giving speeches, writing, and debating.

Hamilton is the star of his club , and he uses Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: it as an opportunity to refine his thinking and his writing and speaking skills. Now, this is obviously a time of a lot of Political ferment in the United States. People are already talking about, um independence revolution and by temperament and by temperament, Hamilton is something of a loyalist. He was someone who liked England. He was moderately conservative. Okay. But he begins to identify with the growing Patriot movement in part because he legitimately thought the British government had overstepped their bounds and were acting egregiously toward their American colonies, but also I can't help but wonder if Hamilton also smelled opportunity in the air. Remember, in that letter to his friend, Edward Stevens, he had ended it by saying, I shall conclude by saying, I wish there was a war. And this was the context of him discussing his ambition and his desire to get ahead. And so I think he knew intuitively that a revolution and a war would present larger than normal opportunities for ambitious and capable young men. So, yes, like, he probably did legitimately intellectually identify With the Patriot movement. But he also probably saw a lot of opportunity there, a lot of opportunity to distinguish himself and make a name for himself, his first essay, which he publishes in an American newspaper is a defense of the Boston Tea Party, an act in which some disguised Patriots boarded British ships at night and dumped their cargo of tea into the Boston Harbor as a protest of British taxes. And so this vandalism is a move that is popular in some circles, but in other circles, especially amongst merchants, it's very unpopular. They're worried about having their cargo seized and thrown into the sea. And so with his background in commerce, Hamilton was able to assuage some of these fears from merchants in New York. He's able to explain why actually in the long run, you know, this is a good and important thing for us and for the colonies. A few weeks after that, he makes his first big public speech. There is a protest, and some people who know him urge him to get up in front of the crowd and make a speech. And so he makes this spectacular, eloquent speech and receives a long, sustained ovation. And this speech rockets him in prominence as a popular speaker in defense of American independence. And this is catnip for Hamilton, who admitted to being motivated by, this is quote, love of fame, the ruling passion of the noblest minds, which would prompt a man to plan and undertake extensive and arduous enterprises", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/alexander-hamilton-part-1-and-2", "title": "Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2", "chunk_index": 12, "publication_date": "2024-06-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 75}}

And this is catnip for Hamilton , who admitted to being motivated by , this is quote , love of fame , the ruling passion of the noblest minds , which would prompt a man to plan and undertake extensive and arduous enterprises Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: for the public benefit. So that is his driving motivation, a love of fame. He regularly writes Pseudonymously. He regularly writes under a pseudonym in the New York newspapers and carries on bruising, written fuse with any who challenged him or defended. Uh, the, the loyalist, the crown. In the, the style of Hamilton is, um, he liked to just. write and say more. He liked to overwhelm his opponents with the quantity and quality of his arguments and his research. Which is not to say that he wasn't also clear and incisive, he was, but his go to strategy was always more. Overwhelm. One major concern of the public at this time was whether America could win a conflict with Britain, and Hamilton writes very prophetically on this topic. He says, Let it be remembered that there are no large plains for the two armies to meet in and decide the conquests. The circumstances of our country put it in our power to evade a pitched battle. It will be better policy to harass and exhaust the soldiers by frequent skirmishes and incursions than to take the open field with them, by which means they would have the full benefit of their superior regularity and skills. Americans are better qualified for that kind of fighting, which is most adapted to this country, than regular troops. And this is so interesting because, I mean, this is a teenager. And here he is laying out the strategy that the U. S. would eventually adopt under Washington well before fighting even breaks out. One of the crazier things about Hamilton is that he was right about basically everything. He was like a prophet in his ability to predict the future. I think one of the things that made Hamilton so good at this was the breadth of his knowledge. He had an excellent understanding of commerce, finance, law, history, science, literature, poetry, you know, you name it. And so he could pull together all of this diffuse knowledge to accurately foresee all circumstances that would arise, and then And predict, you know, what would be most important and therefore what would happen. And it's just amazing to see time after time, you know, he, he predicts here the, the best American strategy in the revolutionary war later in the war, he has this amazing letter where he just writes down word for word, what the British strategy is going to be for the entire war and the British acted out as if they have this document and are trying to follow it like he really prophetically is able to", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/alexander-hamilton-part-1-and-2", "title": "Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2", "chunk_index": 13, "publication_date": "2024-06-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 75}}

What the British are going to try to do. He also accurately predicts what's going to happen in the French revolution. Like he says exactly like it's going to devolve into anarchy and then they're going to have some despot who's going to come in and take over as a monarch. Um, so he predicts Napoleon. Uh, later he predicts kind of the future of the United States and what it will become, like very good at seeing into the future. So anyway, it's a few years like this, that he's in college, he's writing, he's speaking, he is raising his public profile as a, he's raising his public profile as a Patriot intellectual. So it is in the midst of this public turmoil that the Battle of Lexington takes place in Massachusetts. And as soon as fighting breaks out, he joins up with a local militia as an artillery officer. An officer because he was a, you know, he had no military background, but he was a university student and therefore educated, and that is where the officer corps was drawn from. But he's obviously a low ranking officer. He's also still in college this whole time. One of my favorite stories about him comes when he is at college and all this stuff is happening, you know, the battle of Lexington has happened. And so now this patriotic fervor has reached a fever pitch and King's college was actually a bastion of loyalism. You know, it was King's college. It was supposed to be like a Royal institution associated with the British crown. Well, one night. A rowdy group of drunken patriots, well one night, a rowdy group of drunk patriot rioters comes to attack the college's president, who is a very outspoken loyalist. And Hamilton is put in a bind, because he is a leading patriot, but he's also a friend and protege of this college president. His name's Miles Cooper. And Miles Cooper is the one who let him into college, even though he was underage, and he has mentored him the entire time. So he's in this bind. What does he do? Does he side with these rioters, with these patriots or with his friend, the president of the university, Miles Cooper? Well, loyalty was always near the top of Hamilton's virtues. He highly valued friendship and was extremely loyal to his friends. So here's what he did.

He highly valued friendship and was extremely loyal to his friends . So here ' s what he did . Reading now Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: from the Chernow biography, it says, After the mob knocked down the gate and surged toward the residents, Hamilton launched into an impassioned speech, telling the vociferous protesters that their conduct, instead of promoting their cause, would disgrace and injure the glorious cause of liberty. Okay, so he kind of stops them with his speech. He just, he gets them to listen to him for a few minutes. He can't actually stop them. Like, they don't listen to him, they don't turn around and go home, but he preoccupies them for a few minutes. And that is a long enough time that Cooper can escape out the back window and board a ship bound for England. And I find this really admirable. I have given a diatribe in other episodes about loyalty, and so I won't reiterate that here. But I will just say that my b But I will just say that I believe there is no cause important enough that it is worth betraying your friends. There's almost nothing in this world that is more powerful and important than friendship and loyalty. And I find that really admirable in Hamilton that he put himself in a dangerous situation and one in which he was kind of, you know, morally and intellectually compromised just to make sure that no harm Bethel his friend. And, you know, there's another part of this too. It's not just personal loyalty. Hamilton really detested the mob. He was a big skeptic. Of kind of the public in general, especially of like popular emotion. Here's what Chernow writes. He says, even amid an insurrection that he supported, he fretted about the damage to constituted authority and worried about mob rule like other founding fathers. Hamilton would have preferred a stately revolution enacted decorously in courtrooms and parliamentary chambers by gifted orators in powdered wigs. The American Revolution was to succeed because it was undertaken by skeptical men who knew that the same passions that toppled tyrannies could be applied to destructive ends. And so that was Hamilton, and it did create some conflict in his life because he was a revolutionary who was by nature kind of skeptical of revolutions. But I also think it's what created part of his greatness, that tension.

I love Chris. To give you an idea of who he is, I told him I was thinking about getting Asana. And he said, Oh, do you want to see my sauna spreadsheet? I was like, okay. And I was not prepared for what was coming. He had put together a list of hundreds of saunas, anything that was even possible to buy in the United States. He had profiled in this document and he had their costs, their size, how hot they could get drawbacks advantages. And he was telling me about saunas that weren't even out yet that were coming soon to the market. And that is Chris's personality. When he wants to learn something, he learns. Everything about it. He's a very successful guy who has had a successful career in startups. And so if you want to optimize your life, he helps you learn everything you need to know about a topic, whether that is credit cards and points or optimizing your sleep or optimizing your money through investing or starting a podcast. He has a great episode on starting a podcast. He actually did it with Tim Ferriss. Um, and I told Tim everything there is to know about podcasting. So all the hacks is just a really great resource.

So Hamilton during this time really takes to life as an artillery officer. He learns by all means available. Yeah. He thinks he's behind. He doesn't know anything about being a soldier. And so he wants to take advantage of every opportunity to learn. So that includes personal experience. He's going out and drilling whenever he can. That includes book learning. So he's studying up on old military textbooks. So he's studying up on old military textbooks, old military campaigns, memoirs, handbooks, like anything he can get his hands on to read. And then it also includes mentorship. So he goes out and he finds other people, in this case old grizzled artillery officers who had served in the British army or in the French and Indian war, or in the French and Indian war.

I think that ' s actually , I think that ' s actually a really Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: key point. Um, that like, if you can learn in all three of those ways, so that is book learning, experience, and from other people, they have this kind of synergistic effect where if you're just doing one of them, you just aren't going to learn as fast when you can do all three together. Okay. I'm learning from books. Like I'm learning the textbook way to do it. I'm actually getting my hands dirty and getting experience. And I'm learning from people who have done it before. When you combine all three of those, that is the way to supercharge your learning and learn to do anything really fast. And Hamilton does learn really fast and he becomes a very capable artillery officer in basically no time. So keep that in mind. If you want to learn, get those three things together, book learning, experience, and learn from other people. He also has a serious love of pomp and circumstance and his men are always the best drilled. They are the smartest marchers and they are incredibly well dressed. He pays a lot of attention. to their uniforms and the way they look. He's actually at the center of the action when the British attack New York for the first time. He's manning an artillery batter He's manning an artillery battery that is being fired on by the first British ships to attack New York and he displays extreme bravery. Like Napoleon, he's very brave under fire and appears to have this Like almost flagrant disregard for his own life. This is displayed in the first battle when he lets one of his men borrow his musket and the man leaves it at the battery near the place where the British fire in the man leaves it at the battery near the place where the British fire is most intense and so Hamilton asks the guy, Hey, uh, what'd you do with my musket? And he goes, Oh, shoot. I left it back at the fortification, but like at the spot where the British are firing right now with their cannons from, from these ships. And then Hamilton goes and collects his musket as if nothing is happening. The soldier wrote quote, I told him where I had left it.

He ' s just like , oh , okay , let me grab my musket . Goes and grabs his Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: musket, cannonballs are flying all around him, and he just shows no concern. The battle for New York is a complete boondoggle for the Americans. Uh, if you want to learn a little bit more about that, you can listen to the Washington episode, but they are defeated multiple times and are easily driven out by the British. And Hamilton is one of the few people who comes out looking good from this. At every step of the way, his artillery company steps into the breach and saves American troops from being overwhelmed and captured or destroyed with timely and with timely and accurate artillery fire. A contemporary wrote, quote, As soon as his company was raised, he proceeded with indefatigable pains to perfect it in every branch of discipline and duty, and it was not long before it was esteemed the most beautiful model of discipline in the whole army. Okay, and I think that's kind of the key to why he was so successful in New York, is that he just did things the right way. Okay. That, that is one of the things you see from great leaders throughout history. They're professionals. They know their craft. You know, Da Vinci knew how to draw. Napoleon knew how to position cannons. Rockefeller knew how to read a ledger. Like he could act as a low level accountant if he needed to. They're just very solid professionals who know the minutia of their craft. One of the other things he becomes known for is sharing the hardships of his gunners and bombardiers. You know, he always shared their food, their conditions. He slept with his men. Even though he was an officer, he wanted them to know that he was in it with them, right? He wasn't asking them to do anything that he wouldn't do himself. He was known as a tough and strict disciplinarian, but always fair. As soon as his company was raised, he proceeded with indefi And he promoted from within his own rank, and he promoted from within his own, and he promoted from within his own ranks based on merit. In fact, he is. In fact, he's so renowned amongst his men for his fairness that one of his soldiers later in life became a staunch political enemy, uh, you know, Hamilton was a federalist, this guy was a radical Republican and they had had it out in some newspapers, writing essays back and forth. And the guy hired Hamilton as his lawyer, regardless.

And the guy hired Hamilton as his lawyer , regardless . And when Hamilton asks him , you know , Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: we're fighting in the political arena. Are you sure you want to hire me as your lawyer? The man responds, quote, I served in your company during the war, and I know you will do me justice in spite of my rudeness. So Hamilton now has this, this real reputation. He is on the one hand, a very effective leader. Uh, just a, a great officer, a very capable military leader. And then he also has his reputation from before the war as a speaker and a writer. And this makes him a prime candidate to serve as a staff officer. Right, you got someone who's both really good at the military side and really good at the writing side. And so he gets recruited to be the chief of staff of three different generals, and he turns them down every single time. He turns thirsts after military glory. He wants to be in the action. You know, he doesn't want to be a desk jockey translating orders and moving around troops on a map. He wants to be there with the men, firing cannons, um, you know. He wants to be with the men, firing the cannons, exposed to gunfire, like a real military hero. And also because of his independence, which we discussed. He liked to be in charge. He doesn't want to be subservient to anyone. However, you know, he turns down these three generals, but When General Washington recruits him, that's finally a big enough offer to tempt him. He still wasn't thrilled about it, actually. But it seems like he felt that he couldn't say no. This is George Washington, the commander in chief. And he's asking him to come be his aide de camp, his chief of staff. In some ways, this was the second most important post in the entire American military, right? He's basically going to be Washington's number two. There with him every day in the trenches. And so after an interview with Washington, he agrees to serve. as his aide de camp, and joins the staff of General George Washington. Hamilton had a lot of respect for Washington. They had a very good working relationship. But Hamilton later said he rebuffed Washington's advances to develop a more personal friendship. And part of that was, Hamilton was turned off by Washington's temper and his personal foibles.

Um , like he ' s getting this really up close view of Washington who did have a temper Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: and wasn't a perfect person. And, and so part of that is, is just personal differences that they were very different people. But I think most of it was actually not due to that. I think most of it was just that Hamilton could not abide to be subordinate to anyone. He loved control. He loved to be in charge. And so even George Washington, like the man, the hero, the god of the American Revolution, he still just chafes at him to be taking orders all day. Nevertheless, I mean, despite this mental pain that it puts Hamilton through, it really was an amazing working relationship. Like I said, I mean, I guess right there I'm kind of playing up the conflict. They had enormous respect for one another. But they had enormous respect for one another. And in many respects, Hamilton becomes the brains behind Washington. He not only writes for him, but thinks for him. He translates general commands into specific orders. He takes control of finance and supply for the military. He offers important ideas and advice to Washington, ideas that Washington often adopts. And in Washington's absence, he often issued orders in Washington's name. And it's worth noting that Washington never reprimands him for, for issuing orders. It's. And it's worth noting that Washington never reprimands him for this. He always approves of these orders and tells him that he has done well to be proactive in his absence. So Hamilton clearly possesses a genius that Washington does not. But Washington also has some attributes that Hamilton didn't have. There's a passage in the Chernow biography that I think really highlights that. He says, Washington possessed the outstanding judgment, sterling character, and clear sense of purpose, needed to guide his sometimes wayward protege. He saw that the volatile Hamilton needed a steadying hand. Hamilton in turn, contributed philosophical depth, administrative expertise, and comprehensive policy knowledge that nobody in Washington's ambit, that nobody in Washington's ambit ever matched. He could transmute wispy ideas into detailed plans and turn revolutionary dreams into enduring realities. As a team, they were unbeatable and far more than the sum of their parts. Okay, I love that. I think that is so true and such a testament to finding the right partner as a team. They were unbeatable and far more than the sum of their parts.

Um , like sometimes people try and Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: talk down on Steve jobs that, you know, he wasn't really this genius. That was really Steve Wozniak. Well, you know what, it is true that he couldn't have done the engineering that Steve Wozniak did, but it's also true that Steve Wozniak couldn't have done the marketing and sales that he did. That Steve jobs did very similar to Washington and Hamilton. They were unbeatable as a team and far more than the sum of their parts. And so I think in business or in whatever pursuit you're in, that is true. If you can find one of those partnerships that is greater than the sum of its parts, just, you have these incredible results. So Hamilton is really succeeding. So Hamilton is really succeeding at doing well. Uh, in his position on Washington staff. I think it's worth mentioning how quickly this has all happened. In five years, he has gone from an apprenticed clerk in St. Croix To one of the most important commanders in the American military. So he's still only 22 years old at this point. And that contributes to his mystique also. He's only 22 and he looks even younger because he's got this slight stature and this youthful face. He just kind of looks boyish. And so he is this wunderkind, this marvel. I love one passage I love one passage that describes this. that describes this. It says a senior officer recalled Hamilton and his rump company marching into the village. I noticed a youth, a mere stripling, small slender. almost delicate in frame, marching beside a piece of artillery with a cocked hat pulled down over his eyes, apparently lost in thought, with his hand resting on a cannon, and every now and then patting it as if it were a favorite horse or a pet plaything. A mythic gleam began to cling to the young captain. The retreat across New Jersey. 'Well do I recollect the day when Hamilton's company marched into Princeton, said a friend.

I should also mention that Hamilton, with his tireless energy, is also studying and learning new things, even as he's engaged in this war. As he sees the horrible problems that Continental Congress is having paying their troops, he studies finance and monetary po he studies finance and monetary policy. He reads history. I mentioned that he had already read Plutarch's Lives as a child. Well, he has this little notebook of notes and quotes that he keeps for himself, and he has 51 pages of notes from Plutarch's lives that he writes during the revolutionary war. Like 51 pages is almost a book. It's amazing to think that he has the time to do all this. He also writes a 7, 000 word treatise on the form of government that he thinks the United States should take after the conclusion of the war. And he's able to do all of this, even as he is very busy as the chief of staff for George Washington, one of the most important people in the entire revolutionary army. Gives you an idea for his magnificent work capacity They can be doing both of these things at the same time. And he is doing both. I mean, just because he's doing all this study, I don't want you to get the impression that he's a desk jockey. He's still a fighter, you know, he, he felt confined. Uh, he didn't like that. He wasn't at the front as much as he would like to be. But if anything, because he's no longer, but if anything, because he no longer has a direct combat role, he has a sort of mania for danger. In one incident, he rides into the middle of a retreat. And has his horse shot out from under him. And in another incident, he's overseeing a raid when the British come and he and a few comrades run and jump into a boat to cross the river and it is repeatedly shot as they are trying to row across this river. And one of his companions is killed. Another one is injured by a musket shot and Hamilton and the surviving men have to jump out of the boat.

Just before Hamilton returned to headquarters , Washington received a letter from Captain Lee announcing Hamilton ' s death . There Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: were tears of jubilation. as well as considerable laughter when the Sodden corpse himself sauntered through the door. Okay, so he comes so close to death that his death is actually reported to Washington. Although he shows up just a few seconds later. One contemporary wrote that he, quote, appeared to court death. All right, so just like any opportunity he gets to put himself in danger, he's doing it. One thing that raises his status even further is when Benjamin Franklin is able to cement an alliance with the French. And so at that point, you know, the French have a big professional army. Much larger, much more professional than the Americans. And so in some ways they become kind of the primary actors in the war at that point. And, uh, and the Americans become frankly, somewhat auxiliary. And so coordination between the two is really important. Uh, it's very important to be able to communicate with the French and, and find their plans and be able to act in concert. And so because Hamilton spoke fluent French, he spoke better French than anyone in the army. So he frequently acted as a liaison. With French commanders. And so he kind of becomes the head negotiator with the French army. And, uh, and that makes him even more invaluable, even more important in the American army. Now, Hamilton asks Washington to leave his staff and be allowed to lead a division. But Washington tells him that he can't do that. He says, you're indispensable. You know, uh, I can't do without you. Like, I need you for your writing abilities. I need you for your ideas. And I need you, frankly, for your French. Like, no one else can liaison the way you can. And, he also brings up, I can't promote you over full colonels when you are still technically a lieutenant colonel and you haven't been commanding troops for most of the war. And this really ticks off Hamilton, and he lets it simmer until his frustration eventually explodes. Is often the case, the thing that causes the rupture between Washington and Hamilton was a very small personal incident. So, Washington and Hamilton are in the same office in Washington. So, Washington and Hamilton are at headquarters, and Washington is walking by and says, Hey, come see me in my office. And Hamilton says, Sure, let me just get this order sent off first. So he goes.

So he goes . He sends off the order , Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: he comes to Washington's office, and Washington just blasts him, saying, You have kept me, the Commander in Chief, waiting for nearly 20 minutes. Who do you think you are? And Hamilton says like, What are you talking about? You're freaking out. It's only been five minutes and it escalates into a shouting match. And in the shouting match, Hamilton quits. He says, I'm done here. I'm out. Now, Washington had this big temper, but he was at his core a very calm and reasonable man. And he quickly sends a letter to Hamilton saying that he regrets the unfortunate incident and he wants to welcome Hamilton back to his staff. And I think Hamilton is quite rude in his response. And he says, no, I don't want to come back to your staff. I want independent command. Like this, this wasn't an accident. This has been coming for a long time. No, thank you. And I think it's a real Testament to Washington that he never punished Hamilton for this insolence. He was able to set aside his feelings and value Hamilton for what he was instead of focusing on his foibles and Hamilton definitely had foibles. He was very prickly about his honor. Um, and any sense that that it was being infringed upon or put down in any way. And he had this haughtiness even towards George Washington. No one thought they were better than Washington, right? Washington was the man, Hamilton alone had this like air of superiority and to his credit, you know, Washington was able to see past that. I know this isn't a George Washington episode. I just did one of those, but I think there's a real lesson there that when you find a star player, you can't let that kind of talent, you can't let that the kind of talent go. And you have to enable them even when they're being a diva, or they have some significant flaw that you have to work around. And that is what Washington did. Despite. Despite Hamilton's rudeness, Washington consistently promoted him, enabled him, and collaborated with him. Well, so, Hamilton has to cool his heels for a bit while he waits for a command. He's pretty shameless and badgers everyone all the time, asking if there are any open positions, and that includes Washington, who he had just quit on in a huff.

But eventually , a position opens up , Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: and Washington promotes him and gives him his much committed And gives him his much coveted independent command. This leads him, this leads Hamilton to the siege of Yorktown, the climactic battle of the revolution, where he is given three battalions under the overall command of General Washington. At the climactic moment of the siege, two redoubts need to be taken. Okay. So like kind of two little mini forts outside the main fortifications. And the French are allowed to assault one and Hamilton is given the opportunity to take the other redoubt. And this is supposed to kind of show the, and this is supposed to kind of show the, the camaraderie, the, the, the partnership of the French and American militaries, right? The French take one, and Hamil and the Americans take the other, and Hamilton is the one who, who's given the command of the American assault. It is a daring nighttime assault. And Hamilton designs and executes a masterful plan. He has his men up. He has his men unload their guns and attack with bayonets only to preserve the element of surprise for as long as possible, they actually. Hamilton and his men actually moved so quickly that they almost overtake the siege engineers who were disabling the enemy's fortifications. So they rushed through the redoubt, taking it in 10 minutes with very few casualties. It is quick clinical work, a true Hamiltonian perform a true Hamiltonian performance. And on the other side of the battle, the French actually really struggle in in there taking the other redoubt. Which is kind of a testament to how capable of a commander Hamilton was, that he does basically the same mission, but with far fewer casualties. Hamilton, who is already a war hero, gains a new level of stature as the man who led the decisive assault in the decisive battle. Now, after the Battle of Yorktown, it took months for the war to wind down, but Hamilton could see where things were going and was always in a rush, right? And so he was quick to hurry. So he was quick to get things going, to move his career forward. So he rushed back home to be with his wife, Elizabeth Schuyler, who he had married during the war, and his infant son. And we'll talk more about his marriage and his family life next episode, as well as the civilian career that he embarked on after the war.

{"text": "marriage and his family life next episode , as well as the civilian career that he embarked on after the war . But for now , let ' s end it here and talk about our takeaways from the rise of Alexander Hamilton . The first is that idea I Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: mentioned of content, get your thinking out there, start an anonymous Twitter account, start a newsletter, write pieces for an online publication, start a podcast, get your thinking out there, it will open opportunities and attract the kind of people that you are interested in. Point number two is the law of more. The most sure way to succeed. is to just do more. I'm reminded of the podcaster Chris Williamson. Uh, he has a podcast called Modern Wisdom and he's just had a meteoric rise over the last few years. And one of his strategies was just that he saw that most podcasters who did interview style podcasts, uh, did one or at most two interviews per week. So he decided that he was going to do three interviews per week. And that is a strategy that you can always, you know, And that has obviously really worked out for him. He's one of the biggest podcasters in the world now, and that is a strategy you can always control. You can't control the raw talent, what you were born with, but you can control how much you do and just doing more is something that always works. And it worked for Hamilton. He always, you know, in his, he always in his essays, He wrote more as an artillery captain. He practiced and he drilled more as a, an intellectual. He studied and he read more like he just did more than anyone else did. And that is a big explanation. And that is a big reason behind his success. Another takeaway is to go where the opportunity is. Find a function where you can have responsibility, find the revolution that is happening. Settled places and settled industries are usually not the right place to break through quickly. Hamilton gravitated to America and then to the army because he intuited that these were frontiers where talented people could rise quickly. So be like Hamilton, find a frontier industry, a frontier domain, go somewhere where it's not so settled and you'll be able to, and you'll be able to succeed much more quickly. the next, the next point I have written down is that Hamilton was a quick learner. And one reason for that is he was always learning through three ways, right? Through experience, from mentors and from reading and research. And so if you want to learn something really quickly, that's exactly what you do. Start getting some practice, find a mentor or a coach or just someone who knows something about it who can", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/alexander-hamilton-part-1-and-2", "title": "Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2", "chunk_index": 26, "publication_date": "2024-06-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 75}}

And then lastly, I will mention that club that he started in college and that close group of friends that he seemed to gather every step of his career. I actually didn't mention so much. He was very good friends with this guy named Lawrence and the Marquis de Lafayette. Uh, he had just like in college, this very close coterie of friends in the military. So don't go it alone. Find a group of peers who you can bounce ideas off of and learn with. Okay, that does it for part one. Stay tuned for part two dropping soon. Until then, thank you for listening to How to Take Over the World. üìç By the way, if you've listened this far, there's another podcast I want to tell you about that I think you will love. It's actually one that I'm involved with. It's like How to Take Over the World, but for fictional characters. So a number of times I've heard people say, I would love for you to do an episode on Aragorn or Paul Atreides. And I love fiction. And I didn't have time to start that podcast. I actually thought about it, but, but there's no way I could find the bandwidth. But I love fiction. I love that idea. So I worked with my friend Jameson Olsen to launch a podcast that does exactly that. It's called Becoming the Main Character and I think it's really great. Jameson has surpassed my loftiest hopes for the show. It's just phenomenally well done and super fun to listen to and really valuable. I just, I find it so inspiring. So it's called Becoming the Main Character. You can get it wherever you get your podcasts and I've included a link in the show notes. So go give it a listen. ‚Äç One gentleman, whose name I never heard, was an earnest friend of the people, and discanted with much enthusiasm upon the glorious future then opening upon this newborn nation, and predicted the perpetuity of our institutions from the purity and intelligence of the people, their freedom from interest or prejudice, their enlightened love of liberty, etc. etc. Alexander Hamilton was", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/alexander-hamilton-part-1-and-2", "title": "Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2", "chunk_index": 27, "publication_date": "2024-06-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 75}}

Alexander Hamilton was Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: among the guests and his patience being somewhat exhausted, he replied with much emphasis striking his hand upon the table. Your people, sir. Your people is a great beast. Hello, and welcome to how to take over the world. This is Ben Wilson. And the preceding passage was a quote from Theophilus Parsons. Every nation needs a founder. An obvious example is Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore or David Ben Gurion of Israel or Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia. But you also Gaulle is kind of the founder of modern France, for example. Anyway, the founder of a nation needs to do two things. They need to have a vision and a brand, a cult of personality that people buy into. And America is unique in that it has two founders. Washington provided the cult of personality, and Alexander Hamilton is really the one who provided the vision. Okay, most of the time, okay, most of the time, those two things are tied up in a single person, like Lee Kuan Yew, again, great example. But in this case, it was split, and I think the fact that Washington provided that cult of personality obscures the fact that Hamilton is the one who provided the other half of that equation. He's the man with the vision for the nation. In this episode, I want to discuss the true legacy of Alexander Hamilton. And And in this episode, I want to discuss that vision that he had for America and the role he played in, in the role that he played in determining America's future, you know, it's really interesting because I think it's really, Misunderstood what role he played. You're likely familiar with the play Hamilton and in it, Hamilton says about himself, I'm just like my country. I'm young, scrappy, and hungry. He also says things like immigrants, we get the job done. And it's just pretty funny to me that Alexander Hamilton was chosen as the avatar for a liberal re imagining of the American revolution. Because he was, um, well, imagine this. Okay. You get put in a time machine, you step out, it's the year 2200. And your guides talk to you. USA is still a thing.

If you are young leftist in 2200, and then someone comes out and starts singing and the first number teases who this mystery.

Uh, you know, I'm going to name my, I'm going to give my son the middle name Trump, like that is what is happening essentially. Like if you went back to the year 1800. If you asked Thomas Jefferson or James Madison, who is the foremost opponent of American democracy? They would say, Alexander Hamilton. If you asked Alexander Hamilton in the year 1800, who is the foremost American opponent of democracy? He would say, me. In fact, there's a quote from Hamilton that lays out his position quite clearly. Uh, he says, It has been observed that a pure democracy, if we're practicable, would be the most perfect government. Experience has proved that no position is more false than this. democracies in which the people themselves deliberated never possessed one good feature of government. Their very character was tyranny. Their figure, deformity. Okay, so in this episode, in part two, we will get into the real legacy of Alexander Hamilton, how he shaped the American nation, how he became some of the economic and institutional legacies that he left, as well as the intellectual ones. And of course, as always, we will dive into the strategies and the tactics that he used to have such a massive impact on the nation.

This is the legacy of Alexander Hamilton. üìç First, I want to talk to you about just ingredients. If you take protein powder, if you use deodorant, if you use aftershave or beard oil, if you want to take pre workout or vitamins, highly recommend the products from just ingredients. They use real natural ingredients in all of their products. Study after study shows the environmental toxins. Have a real impact on your health. I saw a study that someone posted on Twitter the other day that linked artificial sweetener consumption by pregnant women with increased stress levels in their infants. And when I saw that, it just made me really glad that my wife had been taking just ingredients, protein powder during her pregnancy and not something with artificial sweeteners. Just ingredients only uses real natural ingredients in formulating their products. And they're not just good for you. They look great. And they're not just good for you. They taste great.

I really trust their team and I think you will love their products. That is justingredients. us and use code takeover. For 15 percent off. üìç Okay. So when we left off, uh, the revolution has just ended. Hamilton rushes home to be with his wife and newborn son and starts a career as a successful lawyer. I actually love one quote from Hamilton that shows how he could be self deprecating about his chosen profession. He wrote to Lafayette that he was quite busy, quote, rocking the cradle and studying the art of fleecing my neighbors. During the revolution, he had been a pretty vocal critic of the Continental Congress and the Articles of Confederation, which was the constitution that the U S had been operating under. One of the major problems with the Articles of Confederation was the government's inability to levy taxes. This led to huge financial headaches for the emerging nation. There was just no money to pay for anything. And this meant that revolutionary soldiers wages were often years in arrears. They just hadn't been paid. And the same was true of bondholders. Those who had lent the government money to carry out the Revolutionary War.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/alexander-hamilton-part-1-and-2", "title": "Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2", "chunk_index": 30, "publication_date": "2024-06-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 75}}

Those who had lent the government money to carry out the Revolutionary War . Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: Now, some officers get it in their minds Did I already Did I cover the Newberg conspiracy? industries are usually not the right place to break through with proactive disasters. So Hamilton clearly possesses a genius. You can find one of those partnerships that is greater than some of its parts. Just, you have these incredible results. So Hamilton is really seeming to be doing well, uh, in his position on Washington staff. I think it's worth mentioning that he had funded, um, was a very small personal incentive. So Washington and Hamilton are, you know, to keep, keep, keep, keep, appreciate that. Point the law of more. The most sure way to stay awake for the next episode, as well as the, to be with his wife, Elizabeth Schuyler, who he had married during the war, and his infant son. And we'll talk more about his marriage and his family life next episode, as well as the civilian career that he embarked on after the war. But for now, let's end it here and talk about our take on Okay, no, I did not talk about the Newberg conspiracy. And the same was true of bondholders, those who had lent the government money to carry out the Revolutionary War. So, some officers of the Continental Army get it in their minds that, hey, We are an army. We are the ones with the guns. Let's just march on Philadelphia and motivate Continental Congress to pay us the money that they owe us. This has come to be called the Newburgh Conspiracy. Newburgh is the name of the town where the officers were, were living, were stationed. Now the whole thing is shrouded in mystery. Uh, you know, it's kind of a, a nascent military coup. And so it was obviously extremely secretive. It's unclear to this day which members of the conspiracy favored an outright military junta, which ones just wanted to apply some pressure, and how much support there really was for each position. Hamilton was definitely involved, though once again it's hard to know exactly what his position was and how deep his involvement was. But we do have some letters, so, so I think we can form a pretty good idea. He wrote to Washington, The claims of the army, urged with moderation, but with firmness, may operate on those weak minds which are influenced by their apprehensions more than their judgments. But the difficulty will be to keep a complaining and suffering army within the bounds of", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/alexander-hamilton-part-1-and-2", "title": "Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2", "chunk_index": 31, "publication_date": "2024-06-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 75}}

But the difficulty will be to keep a complaining and suffering army within the bounds of Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: moderation. Okay, so he's basically saying, like, yes, maybe we can use this situation to apply some pressure, but there is going to be difficulty keeping the army in the bounds of moderation. So he definitely does not want an all out coup. Um, Chernow writes, Hamilton still clung to the notion that a convincing bluff of armed force could help spur Congressional action, but that was as far as he would venture. Quote, as to any combination of force, he observed, it would only be productive of the horrors of a civil war, might end in the ruin of the country, and would certainly end in the ruin of the army. Okay, so, he writes to Washington, um, He wants to apply some pressure, but doesn't want this to get out of control. So he tells Washington, Hey, you need to come take control here. And Washington does, he comes, he gives a speech. He calms down, uh, the army and convinces them to submit to, and convinces them to submit to civilian rule. And he lectures Hamilton along the way. He says, quote, the army is a dangerous instrument to play with. And he's right. It's, it's really playing with fire. Like, it's, it's, it's hard to carry out, uh, just a little bit of coup. Uh, those, those things have a way of getting out of control, and so it was good that Hamilton had the superior judgment of Washington in this incident. Uh, you know, why would Hamilton be involved in this at all? I mean, on the one hand, he really believed that the bondholders and the soldiers of the Continental Army should be paid. He was a marshal man through and through. Nothing mattered to him. As much as military glory. And he was the world's strongest advocate of a muscular United States with a strong military and strong financial capabilities. On the other hand, he hated a mob. Uh, you know, you heard those quotes at the beginning about democracy. He, he viewed democracy, he viewed democracy as mobocracy and having a, an army be that democracy was not any better to him. Okay. So the idea of disorder really bothers him. And so that's why he's trying to kind of split the middle here. Like he really agrees with the ends.

But not with the means , but like I said , luckily Washington kind of Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: squashes this and what happens instead is that Washington along with his friend, James Madison, and luckily Washington squashes this. And what happens instead is that Hamilton along with James Madison, George Washington, and a few others, but those were the most important ones. Call for a constitutional convention of course, to revise the Articles of Confederation, to make this government work better. And like I said, there, there were a few people calling, uh, for this constitutional convention, one historian, Catherine Drinker Brett. One historian, Catherine Drinker Bowen, writes, Among those who began early to work for reform, three names stand out. Washington, Madison, and Hamilton. And of the three, evidence points to Hamilton as the most potent single influence towards calling the Convention of 87. Okay. So Alexander Hamilton is the primary mover behind calling the constitutional convention. So all the states send delegates to this constitutional convention at first, again, to revise the articles of confederation, but, you know, pretty quickly they say, look, this whole thing needs to be thrown out. And we need to start from the ground up and design a new government. Hamilton throughout the entire process, uh, is a advocate of a strong federal government. He says, if these states are not united under a federal government, They will infallibly have wars with each other and their divisions will subject them to all the mischiefs of foreign influence and intrigue. Okay, so he's worried that if you don't really tie these, these states together into a single nation, if you leave it kind of how it is under the Articles of Confederation, which is that these states are really separate political entities. With just a coordinating mechanism in the Articles of Confederation. If you keep with that, eventually there's going to be conflict and war between the states. And when that conflict or war happens, outside actors are going to take advantage of the United States. So he's really trying to forge a strong, single nation with a strong central government. So, and as the debate goes on, um, A lot of viewpoints are put forward. One plan is put forward called the Virginia plan because it's proposed by James Madison with support from the other Virginia delegates. And that is what would eventually be adopted as the constitution of the United States that we know today. Hamilton, um, likes the Virginia plan, but doesn't love it.

And he thinks , you know , this is my one shot . To , he thought Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: this is my one shot to propose what I really think would be the best form of government. And so, um, he puts forward a plan for essentially a limited elective monarchy. And, you know, it's hard to know exactly what he meant by this. Monarchy, because in some ways the monarch is subject to oversight. So the Senate could recall him, um, and he only serves on good behavior, but he does in his notes, make some, um, notes that he thinks it should be hereditary and that the monarch should be above ordinary politics and not subject to law. So like it is a weird fusion of monarchy with some. Kind of democratic elements to, to check it. It is definitely a representative form of government. It's a limited monarchy, but it is sort of a monarchy and it's very quixotic. People kind of can't believe that Alexander Hamilton is coming to the constitutional convention and proposing. A monarchy. And so, um, like he goes on for hours. It is this marathon speech where he lays out exactly why he thinks this is the perfect form of government. Every feature and benefit. Meanwhile, everyone is just kind of tuned out. Like, what are you talking about? We're not going to have a limited monarchy. Uh, we just overthrew the British who have a limited monarchy. And so actually it's funny because the next speaker is James Madison. He just doesn't address it. Like, Hamilton has gone on for hours proposing this plan and he goes, Okay, moving on, back to the Virginia plan. And, uh, and everyone keeps going on about their business. This would prove to be a thorn in Hamilton's side. There was strict secrecy. No one was supposed to say what anyone else had said, right? Um, because they wanted the freedom to debate what they really believed without it being leaked and people, you know, uh, criticizing or critiquing specific plans. Like it was supposed to be this open conversation. open air where you could brainstorm and talk about anything.

Like you don ' t believe in , uh , in this system of Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: government at all. I should know. Here's what turnout writes about it. He says even here in his most extreme statement, He called for a chief executive subject to ultimate legislative control. However atrociously misguided the idea was, it fell short of proposing a real monarchy, in which a king has permanent, autonomous, hereditary powers that supersede those of all other branches of government. Okay, but by even attaching his name to the brand of monarchy, which was toxic in the United States at the time, it was, , it was a bad idea. One thing that it does do, though, is there's something called the New Jersey Plan, and that is the kind of more, And that is the weakest version that's proposed that that's kind of not that different from the articles of confederation. So there's the New Jersey plan. Then there's the Virginia plan proposed by Madison. And that is much stronger than the Articles of Confederation, but not as strong as Hamilton's plan. And then you have Hamilton's plan. What Hamilton's plan ends up doing is making the Virginia plan seem more reasonable. A lot of people that had been gravitating towards the New Jersey plan say, Oh, okay. Well, when you put it like that, you know, the Virginia plan actually seems moderate and seems like the middle option, the most moderate thing. And so , I don't think that was his intention. was to, you know, push forward the Virginia plan, but that's the effect that it ends up happening. So the Virginia plan is adopted and is recommended by constitutional Congress. And even though it isn't the plan that Hamilton had espoused, he really supports it. You know, he called together this committee. Convention and he believed that hey, we're gonna debate. We're gonna talk We're gonna see what we all think is the best plan and then whatever we propose We're gonna stick to and we're all going to promote and so he does he goes out on the road and he really supports And advocates for this new Constitution, which I think is a testament to not letting the perfect be the enemy of the good You know, he did not think this was a perfect constitution.

And so he really supports it. And I think that's a lesson. Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Let's take a quick break to talk about Henson shaving. Alexander Hamilton was clean shaven. As you know, if you've ever seen a 10 bill and that you might know, despite what we, as you know, if you've ever seen an, as you know, if you've ever seen a 10, as you know, if you've ever seen a 10 bill, and despite what you might've seen on the stage. on Lin Manuel Miranda with his frankly ridiculous goatee. And of course, you can't imagine Alexander Hamilton, one of the great men of American history, with some scruff for a beard. So if you want to be like Hamilton, you need to shave, and specifically, you need to shave with Henson razors. Henson Shaving is a family owned aerospace parts manufacturer that has been made, that has made parts for the IAT, has made parts for the International Space Station and Mars Rover, and now, they are bringing precision engineering, To your shaving experience. If you're like 88 percent of men who experienced irritation from shaving, you might be expecting the worst with each shave yet. Henson users have seen dramatic improvements, including the disappearance of ingrown hairs and razor bumps. And this has to do. With the blade extension. Okay. So their technology, you can think of a razor blade as a diving board. The longer the board, the more it wobbles, the more you get nicks and cuts. And so they have this stabilization technology that stops the blade from wobbling and so it's less irritation, better shave. Why don't other brands do this? It's a manufacturing issue. And Henson's aerospace background has enabled the creation of razors with unmatched precision using their machines. They're able to achieve a blade extension of just 0. 0013 inches, less than a human hair's thickness. And they use safety riders. And they use disposable replaceable safety blades. Uh, so it's really cheap. It's, you know, like 5 a year for, for all the blades you'll need to shave. So it's very cost effective.

And so they weren't crazy about giving up a lot of this power to, to, to submit themselves to the federal government. And so Hamilton has some work to do in convincing people. And so he dreams up this series of essays called the Federalist Papers. And this will be a point by point. And this will be a point by point explanation of and defense of the constitution. And so he recruits a few other participants, John Jay and James Madison to help him write this. And, uh, Madison makes some pretty significant contributions. John Jay, um, actually never gets around to writing that much. Um, and Hamilton ends up writing, uh, 53. And Hamilton ends up writing 51 of the 85 essays that go into the Federalist Papers, so he writes most of them. And the Federalist Papers are, are just magnificent. And it's both a literary and political masterpiece I so to get personal here when I went to college. I was an english major. I flirted with majoring in history I might have changed my my major to history for a little bit And then I took a course in constitutional law and all we did was read and study the federalist papers And I fell in love. Um, I just, you know, it's a political treatise. It's almost a page turner it's written in such a compelling style, especially the essays written by Hamilton. And, um, I was just obsessed. I was like, this is amazing. And so I, I ended up changing my major to political science. So, you know, I decided what I studied in college based on these papers, the Federalist Papers. Hamilton has this amazing ability to be both topical and timeless at the same time to address the issues of the day. Because ultimately this was like kind of journalistic, right?

But he brings, but he brings his writing back to the core principles that resonate across generations. And so it's timeless at the same time. And so it's amazing that it can serve the dual purpose, being very timely and very pertinent to people who are thinking about, Oh, should I pass? To people who are thinking, Oh, should I, should I vote to pass the constitution? And also, you know, I can read them in 2009, whatever it was, and still think that it's amazing writing and it's interesting. He, you know, I talked about this in the first. He, you know, I talked about this in the, uh, first episode, that he accomplishes like 10 times as much as a normal person. Uh, so he writes these on a tight deadline, uh, cause this stuff has to be voted on. He writes all these 53 essays in less than a year, I think, in, in a few months. And so it's worth diving into how does he do this? How does he write so quickly and so well? Uh, contemporary William Sullivan left this account, he said, One who knew his habits of study said of him that when, and he's speaking of Hamilton, when he had a serious object to accomplish, his practice was to reflect on it previously, and when he had gone through this labor, he retired to sleep without regard to the hour of the night. And having slept six or seven hours, he rose and having taken strong coffee, seated himself at his table where he would remain six, seven, or eight hours. And the product of his rapid pen required little correction for the press. Okay. So I think that's a very interesting strategy. Think, sleep, and write. People talk a lot in that thinking phase, they would see him walking around muttering to himself. He would kind of speak in a very soft voice and, um, and he would do that for hours. Until he really had his thoughts clear. And then he would sit down to write and write it all at once with a very, very few corrections. He didn't do a lot of revisions or a lot of drafts. So, uh, you know, I think that's a very interesting approach. The Federalist Papers were extremely influential at the time. They helped convince a lot of people that the constitution was a good idea.

They helped convince a lot of people that the constitution was a good idea . And Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: they've been very influential since then. The Federalist Papers have been cited more times by the Supreme Court than any other document. Or any other ruling, any, anything, including the constitution itself. Okay, the Federalist Papers have been cited by the Supreme Court more than the Constitution. That's how influential they have been in determining what federal law would look like for the next 200 years. So it's difficult to overstate the importance to American government of the Federalist Papers. One of the reasons is the Constitution is not long and is not detailed. And so interpret And so in interpreting it, you can take it a lot of different ways. And so to have this much longer document, the Federalist Papers, that explains the thoughts of Hamilton and Madison and Jay, these people who helped to form the constitution is really helpful in saying, okay, well, this is kind of what we're supposed to do with this. So Hamilton writes the Federalist Papers, but it's not just heavy, you know, heady academic work that he's doing. He also, in New York, is on the ground, is on the ground at their Constitutional Convention where they bring in all these legislators to vote on, okay, are we gonna pass this Constitution? Uh, nine states agree pretty quickly. to pass the constitution, but you have some pretty big holdouts, including New York and Virginia. And so Hamilton does some masterful manipulation of procedures. He inserts a rule, uh, in the proceedings of this convention that every clause of the constitution has to be debated, clause by clause. So this is smart because number one, it makes him the expert. No one can compete with him. If you're just talking about the constitution as a whole, Okay, Hamilton, you got your opinion. I've got my opinion. You think it's a good idea? I think it's a bad idea. If we're talking clause by clause, whether this is a good idea or a bad idea, well, Hamilton is the expert on the Constitution. I'm not an expert. And so, it's tough for me to argue with Hamilton in that context. The other thing it does, Is slow down the proceedings. This is going to take a long time to debate clause by clause, every clause in the constitution. And what this does is give more States a chance to pass the constitution, you know, with nine States having passed it.

And what this does is give more States a chance to pass the constitution , you know , with nine States having passed it . Okay . Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: That's some momentum, but Hey, we're New York. Maybe we could hold out, but once it's 10, 11, And then eventually it's 12 states. Everyone passes it before New York. Then the momentum is so overwhelming. Okay. Do we really want to be the people on the outside here? Do we want to be the people who do we want to be the people who don't pass the constitution? And now we have to think about, all right, like, are we going to rebel against everyone else? Are we going to try and go our own way? That's pretty audacious to think about. And so by slowing it down and letting the other states pass the constitution, um, that builds the pressure to pass the constitution. And so eventually it does. I mean, it's a very near run thing. It's very close. Uh, the final vote is 30 to vote. The final vote is 30 to 27 in favor of the constitution. And one of the people who changed their votes. At the last minute gives credit to Alexander Hamilton and says a certain gentleman has put forward some pretty persuasive arguments that have allowed me to vote for the constitution. The thing that everyone is worried about when people don't want to pass the constitution, it's because they think that the central government is too strong, especially the executive. So they're looking at this office of the president. Of the United States. And they're saying, you know, that's a, that's a pretty powerful president. And that's scary to us because we just had this bad experience with the King of England, and we don't like anything that even remotely looks like a King. And this president, he's like a strong executive, you know, he has all these powers, he controls the army, he seems like a King to me. And so to me, this is an example of, there is such a thing as learning a lesson too well, right? You, something bad happens and then you over correct. You know, everyone was scarred by their experience under British rule, and anything that even remotely resembled a king was suspect in the eyes of many Americans. And Hamilton's point was, guys, I hate to break it to you, but the British system, it works pretty well.

What we need here are small tweaks to make sure you don't have, you know, some tyranny like you had under British rule, but like, We do not want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. This system of government clearly works very well. And so having something that kind of resembles the British system is not a bad thing. Okay. So I think that's a good lesson. Don't overcorrect. And so I think that's a good lesson. Don't over correct. If you get critiqued or criticized and it really hits home, okay, yes, that is probably a shortcoming that you need to address, but you have to be careful not to learn the lesson too much. Don't obsess over it. Just make the necessary change and move on. Anyway, the constitution passes. It's a near run thing, but of course nothing generates enthusiasm. So even though it was very controversial, as soon as the Constitution passes, the opposition kind of melts away, and the public gives way to public celebrations. In New York, Hamilton is celebrated as the hero of the day. Some people even suggest renaming New York City in his honor. Flags are flown with his image on them, and a ship is pulled down Broadway in a big parade that has been rechristened the Federal Ship Hamilton. Now, the big heroes of the day are Hamilton in New York, Madison in Virginia, and also George Washington. And in fact, I don't think the constitution would have passed as written if it weren't for Washington, because everyone had him in mind as the first president. And as I mentioned, everyone was kind of skeptical of this strong executive, but that's kind of softened by, well, we're pretty sure the first executive is going to be George Washington and everyone trusts him. Everyone knows he's not power hungry. His character is above reproach and he was universally beloved. So he was the only person with the public trust to wield this new public office without fear that he would become a king or abuse this power of the presidency. So Hamilton is one of the many people who writes to George Washington asking him to run for first president of the United States. Of course, we know George Washington accepts and he wins the election and becomes the first president of the United States of America.

I think it ' s As he steps in to office , it ' s difficult to stress just how uncertain everything was Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: at this point. The Constitution was like instructions for a painting. Okay, imagine that. You pick up a piece of paper and it says, okay, paint a woman sitting down, wearing a dress, and there's some scenery behind her, there's a river, some trees, and some mountains. There are billions of ways. That you could actually paint that painting. Is the woman facing towards you? Is she facing away from you, looking at the scenery? Is it a profile of the woman? Are there a lot of trees? Is it a forest? Or is there just, like, a couple trees? Is she in a grove? Is the river a big, rushing river? Or is it a little stream that's going by? Like, the Constitution tells you almost nothing about how to actually run the government. To give one example, the Constitution sets limits on the power of the federal government. They can only make laws in certain domains. Like creation of a military, a postal service, taxation, regulating interstate commerce, stuff like that. Okay, so what happens if Congress passes a law that is unconstitutional? Well, there are vague hints that the judiciary should decide what is and is not constitutional, but there are no processes to do that. The processor system just has to be invented. And it's, you know, during Washington's administration that this is going to be invented. You know, another question, there's a president, there's But basically no other instructions about the executive branch of government. What should it look like? How should it be structured? Are there departments? If so, what are they? How many employees, who do they report to? I mean, here's what the constitution says. It has a number of clauses stipulating how the president will be chosen and who can serve and how he will be paid. But here are the actual instructions for what the president of the United States actually does. Okay. I'm about to read for you the full instructions of the office of the president of the United States. Quote. This is according from the Constitution. The President shall be Commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several states when called into the actual service of the United States.

Except in cases of impeachment, he shall have power by and with the advice and consent of the Senate to make treaties provided two thirds of the senators present provided two thirds of the senators present concur, and he shall nominate. And by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme Court, and all other officers of the United States, whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by law. He shall, from time to time, give to the Congress information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient. He may, on extraordinary occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and in case of disagreement between them, with respect to the time of adjournment, he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper. He shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers. He shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed and shall commission all the offices of the United States. Okay. So there it is. That's it. I just told you everything. So you get some ambassadors, you get some foreign relations, you get a little bit about his relationship to Congress and what he should do towards them. You get the state of the union. What you don't get is the explicit mention of taxation of, um, tax collectors. You don't have, uh, like. You don't have any supervision over industrial policy or economic policy. Like all the things that the president does today, none of that is in there. And for George Washington, he's a terrific leader, but he just does not have the organizational mind create this government out of nothing. And so one of the first people that he calls on is Alexander Hamilton. He actually, at first asks someone else to be treasury secretary. And the guy says, no, the man you're looking for is Alexander Hamilton. And Washington says, Hamilton? Uh, finance secretary, you know, you get the idea that Hamilton, you know, you get the idea that George Washington had him in mind to serve in the administration, but probably in the military or some other capacity, uh, they had never discussed finances.

He knows more than anyone about this stuff. Hamilton's the guy you want. So Hamilton it is. And it's Hamilton who, as I mentioned. And so Washington brings him on as Treasury Secretary, but that is kind of misleading. Like, yes, he sets up the Treasury, he sets up the finances of the United States, but it is Hamilton who, as I mentioned, is really going to be the visionary, the mastermind behind the entire American government. Cher now quotes another historian who writes, Hamilton was an administrative genius who assumed an influence in Washington's cabinet which is unmatched in the annals of the American cabinet system. Okay, we've never had a guy like Hamilton. He was essentially the shadow president. Washington asked for his opinion on everything, and he took his opinion on almost everything. So Hamilton gets in there, he's got carte blanche, and the first thing he does is beef up the taxation system. This is going to be the most unpopular measure that he undertakes, so best to undertake it right after the election, while George Washington is at the peak of his popularity. And what goes into a taxation system? It involves tax collectors, inspectors, and taxpayers. A coast guard to clamp down on smuggling and make sure people actually, you know, come to port, pay their taxes, and duties. As well as a system of public works, like lighthouses, to make American ports an attractive place to come and do business. So, Hamilton organizes all this, he's an extremely detail oriented person, and he carries out this new system with perfection. Chernow writes, Hamilton's appetite for information was bottomless. To his port wardens, he made minute inquiries about their lighthouses, beacons, and buoys. He asked customs collectors, he asked customs collectors for ship manifests so he could ascertain the exact quantity and nature of cargo being exported. The whole statistical basis of government took shape under his command. Okay. I like that. The whole statistical basis for government took shape under his command. He's the one who says, we need to know everything. We need a quantitative measurement of everything that's happening in the government.

And Hamilton thought , and Hamilton thought it was essential . Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: A number of states had issued debt to fund the revolutionary war and Hamilton wanted to nationalize it, take on all the state debts and convert it into us debt. Now this was controversial for a few reasons. One was the idea of national debt was now this nationalization of debt was controversial, controversial. Was controversial for a few reasons. One was that the idea of a national debt at all was controversial. You know, again, people viewed the British system with the bank of England. Um, and, and they saw that, Hey, this bank of England that funds the British Navy, the British army, like this is a source of tyranny. So many people wanted no national debt at all. And then many states, especially southern states, had almost completely paid off their debt already. So they're saying, okay, you essentially want us, through taxes, to help pay off the debts of Massachusetts and New York and some of these northern states. Like, this is, it's like an anti socialism argument, right? Like, why should we pay? For the financial mismanagement of other states. Now Hamilton's rebuttal would be, yeah, you paid off more of your debt, but part of that is because you did less fighting in the revolutionary war. The North was the main theater of war. And as a consequence, they'd raised more troops, more material. So Hamilton and his backers say, yeah, we should help pay the debts of these States who did more to win the revolutionary war for all of us. All of us have our independence now. So Hamilton goes on a high pressure lobbying campaign to see this plan of Assumption and So Hamilton goes all out. He goes on a high pressure lobbying campaign to see this plan of Assumption and a national bank passed in Congress. He has many enemies, especially Southerners, and especially James Madison and Thomas Jefferson. Hamilton and Madison had just collaborated on the Constitution and the Federalist Papers, but now they have this big falling out over this plan for a bank. And the assumption of state debt. There's a famous incident in 1790 where Hamilton says, okay, Jefferson, Madison, like we have to work something out. And so he invites them to a dinner and says, come on guys, let's come to a deal.

And there was debate about whether it should be in New York. Or Philadelphia, or maybe somewhere in New Jersey or somewhere in the South. And Hamilton says, if you guys pass this assumption plan and a national bank, then I will give you the capital. We'll put it somewhere in the South. We'll put it in Virginia and Jefferson and Madison agree. This is called the compromise of 1790. It's sometimes referred to as the dinner table bargain because they just hash it out over this dinner. And it is Hamilton at his best. He had this amazing ability to see what really mattered most. Even when it sometimes appeared less significant than others perceived, you know, here, the state capital is going to bring, you know, here, the national capital is going to bring immediate benefits. The, the, the national capital comes to Virginia, all of a sudden you have this big economic boom because you're going to have all these government employees and they're going to buy land. And so you have an increase in land prices and they're going to need businesses to supply them with food and materials. And, uh, if the decisions are being made close to home, maybe that's going to advantage you a little bit. Like the benefits are immediate. Of a capital of a capital moving to your area. However, in the long run, this assumption of state debt and this creation of a bank is going to tie all of the states together. It's going to create a kind of irrevocable basis for this federal government that can't be undone. And so, yeah, they get the capital, but Hamilton gets the full vision for what the federal government will become. He gets to create that. And so it seems like a compromise, but it's actually totally lopsided. In Hamilton's favor, Madison and Jefferson kind of think, well, we can always, you know, repeal this stuff later, but it turns out you can't, um, once the stuff gets, gets implemented, it has a way of hanging around. So, you know, this ability of Alexander Hamilton to see what is actually the most significant issue and attack that issue.

Reminds me a lot of Alexander the Great , you know , famously at the Battle of Gagamela , he ' s outnumbered , you know , famously at the Battle of Gagamela , he ' s Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: outnumbered, he's outpositioned, he's in, he's in horrible circumstances, and the battle starts, and he realizes that he's losing, but he says, I don't need to defeat the Persian army, I just need to defeat the Persian king, Darius. So at the decisive moment of the battle, he takes his elite cavalry and makes a direct attack on Darius himself and his royal bodyguard. And Darius, who is in personal danger, turns and flees. , and his army, which is winning at the time, sees their king, sees their king retreating, running away, and even though they're winning, this freaks them out, and they turn and run as well. So, so both Alexanders had this ability to ignore everything except for the crux, the most important issue, and focus on that, and win by focusing on that most important thing. And look, he was right. You know, Ronald Reagan joked that a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we'll ever see on this earth. Uh, all respect to Brian Johnson who disagrees, but, but it's true that these government bureaus, they have all this bureaucratic inertia. They're very hard to undo once they've been enacted. And when Thomas Jefferson eventually becomes president eight years later, you know, he has this intention of undoing all of Hamilton's work. He's going to get in there and just press undo, but what actually happens is he gets in the presidency and he looks at all the revenue that's coming in from this national bank and all the stuff that he can fund with it. And he's like, yeah, I kind of, I kind of need this. And actually after him, Madison becomes president and Madison is like, no, no, no, I'm a committed ideologue. I am going to repeal the charter of the, of the U S bank. And so he, he lets it expire. The bank goes away within a matter of months. Madison is like, Oh man, I can't fund anything. I need that bank. And so he recharters the, the, uh, the national bank. So Hamilton, this is a genius plan that allows him to shape the future of the federal government in a real and lasting way.

When you have the nation put on sound economic footing , you have Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: this, this great economic, you have this great economic upswing, but it also at the same time, And Hamilton should have foreseen this creates a lot of resentment, especially in the South, because, uh, these new treasuries, these new bonds sold by this national bank are only sold in New York. Okay. So if you're a Southerner, like, okay, yeah, maybe if you're a wealthy Southerner, you're going to sail up from, you know, whatever, Georgia. And come by us bonds, but probably not the overwhelming majority of these bonds are sold to New Yorkers and beyond New Yorkers, Northerners, right? You might come down from Boston. That's a much easier trip than from, uh, than from Georgia, but Southerners are essentially frozen out of this bonanza of financial speculation that comes this new national bank. So that's a tactical error by Hamilton. But having said that, the reason that there's such strong app, But the reason that there is such strong opposition to this bank is not, uh, these small tactical errors, but it's because people like Jefferson and Madison opposed not only a national bank, but the idea of banks in general. Okay. That's kind of hard to imagine in the year 2024, but they want no banks. They just don't think they're necessary to a functioning economy. And they thought they were cesspools of corruption, which, you know, fact check true. But I mean, in the long run, yes, a modern economy needs banks to function. And Hamilton was dragging the country into modernity, kicking and screaming in the case of people like Madison and Jefferson. And so Chernow points out that it basically falls to Hamilton to single handedly create a blossoming market economy. Here's what he writes, quote, Hamilton did not create America's market economy so much as foster the cultural and legal setting. in which it flourished. A capitalist society requires certain preconditions. Among other things, it must establish a rule of law through enforceable contracts, respect private property, create a trustworthy bureaucracy to arbitrate legal disputes, and offer patents and other protections to promote invention. The abysmal failure of the Articles of Confederation to provide such an atmosphere was one of Hamilton's principal motives for promoting the Constitution. It is known, he wrote, that the relaxed conduct of the state governments in regards to property and credit. was one of the most serious diseases under which the body public labored prior", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/alexander-hamilton-part-1-and-2", "title": "Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2", "chunk_index": 48, "publication_date": "2024-06-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 75}}

It is known , he wrote , that the relaxed conduct of the state governments in regards to property and credit . was one of the most serious diseases under which the body public labored prior Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: to the adoption of our present constitution and was a natural material cause of the state of public opinion which led to its adoption. Okay, so Hamilton is creating the conditions under which a market economy can flourish. Now, one concern that Washington has with all of this is is any of it even constitutional? The Constitution does not specifically authorize the creation of a central bank to issue debt on behalf of the government. And so he asks Jefferson, Is this constitutional? And Jefferson writes him a letter saying, no, it's not. And giving reasons why it's not. And then he asks Hamilton, who writes a 40 page, 15, 000 word defense of the funding scheme. Okay. He's in a great position to do this because not only was he the nations and perhaps the world's foremost expert on central banking, he was also the greatest living scholar on constitutional law, having written most of the Federalist papers and the crux of his argument lies with what is called the implied powers doctrine, which takes use of the necessary and proper clause. Okay, so this clause. Is, is a clause in the Constitution that says the government shall have power, quote, to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by the Constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or office thereof. Okay. So it's really just kind of like a technical point that yes, like, um, you can do anything necessary and proper to carrying out the powers vested in, in you, in the government. And so Hamilton says, yes, the constitution does not authorize the creation of a central bank, but. A central bank is necessary to the execution of all other governmental powers, because it allows us to raise the funds to carry them out. So it's a revolutionary interpretation when the, so this is a very revolutionary interpretation, one that would influence constitutional law up to the present day. And if I'm putting on my constitutional lawyer hat, I'm a real expert here. I took a whopping three classes on constitutional law in undergrad. To me, though, from what I can see, this argument is pretty thin. Like, you can argue almost anything is constitutional. Like, you can argue almost anything is necessary and proper.

You know , who ' s to say what is necessary and proper to the carrying out of constitutional authority ? It basically removes all checks on what authority is Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: constitutionally delegated And this is not just my idea. Henry Cabot Lodge was an American senator in the late 1800s, early 1900s. Great statesman. And he wrote, That the implied powers enunciated by Hamilton was the most formidable weapon in the armory of the constitution, capable of conferring on the federal government powers of almost any extent. And the Supreme court took up this idea of the implied powers doctrine. Um, John Marshall, famous Supreme court justice was like a big devotee, a big admirer of Hamilton, and he just takes us and runs with it, implied powers doctrine. And in my mind, when this happens, this is when the government ceases to be Madison's creation. And in my mind, this is when the government ceases to be Madison's creation, even though he's the one who actually wrote the Constitution, and becomes Hamilton's government. Madison is known as the father of the Constitution, but he's just not. Hamilton is. Madison wrote some words on some paper, yes, but that's not what a Constitution is. A real Constitution is how the government operates. And it was Hamilton who determined that by his work as treasury secretary and by his work in creating this implied powers doctrine. In the show Game of Thrones, uh, in the first season, there's this succession crisis. The king dies and his good friend, Ned Stark, is on one side and, uh, and his wife and young son are on the other and this and the deceased king's wife and young son are on the other side. And You know, who is going to take over for this deceased King and Ned Stark, Lord Stark had gone and seen the King right before he passed away and got him to sign a paper. Saying that, uh, Lord Stark should be the lord and protector of the realm after I die. Okay, he, he signs this on his deathbed. And so there's this big crisis in, uh, in the throne room. And Ned Stark marches in and says, no, I'm in charge here. And he holds up this paper. And he has someone open it and read it. And, uh, it says, you know, signed by King Robert Baratheon.

And then she rips it up and she says , is Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: this meant to be your shield? Lord Stark, a piece of paper. And then she tells the guards to arrest them. And I think it's a really interesting point, right? Like paper is not what determines what actually happens. In the battle between action and paper action always wins. And that is what Hamilton is doing here. He's saying nice paper, Ham. And that is what Hamilton is essentially doing here. He is the Cersei Lannister of early America. He's saying, nice paper, Madison. Actually, we can do anything that we can argue is necessary and proper for the government to carry out its duties, and that is almost anything. And so, it's my government now. That is why historians write things like, quote, Hamilton's works and words have been more consequential than those of any other American in shaping the constitution under which we live. And I agree, Hamilton shaped the Constitution even more than the guy who wrote the Constitution. Okay, so that is how Hamilton shapes the federal government under Washington. He does a lot of other things, too. Uh, one of the big ones is that you have your first minor rebellion in response to some of Hamilton's taxes. It's called the Whiskey Rebellion. And Washington and Hamilton go and personally lead federal troops in response to this rebellion. It's an overwhelming response. Some might say it was overkill, but, but it was an important move to show just how powerful this government was. You know, this is not negotiable. You pay your taxes. We're in charge here. He also does a lot in foreign affairs. Like Hamilton is the treasury secretary, but he has his fingers in every branch of government and, um, and he shapes everything that happens, especially in the first four years of Washington's presidency now, at the same time, he's sowing the seeds of his own defeat. Uh, during his tenure as treasury secretary, there's a very famous incident. That would do more than anything else to ruin Hamilton's career. A woman named Maria Reynolds. It's spelled Maria, but apparently it's pronounced Mariah. Actually, Mariah Reynolds comes to Hamilton and gives him this sob story about her abusive husband. Uh, she says, you know, he had abused her and then left her in the lurch with no money. To travel home. So she's just stuck and Hamilton always had a soft spot for orphans and", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/alexander-hamilton-part-1-and-2", "title": "Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2", "chunk_index": 51, "publication_date": "2024-06-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 75}}

So she ' s just stuck and Hamilton always had a soft spot for orphans and Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: destitute women because of his childhood. And so he's moved by this plea and he says, Hey, you know, I'll see what I can do. I'll meet you later. So he goes over to her house later that night with some money. And she says, come on in and accepts the money. And then makes it clear that she is very thankful for his support. And, uh, you know, would you like me to make it up to you, sir, however I can? You're my hero, Mr. Alexander Hamilton. So, you know, you can paint the picture in your head. And Hamilton begins an affair with Mariah Reynolds. That would run on for months. Well, it's not too long until her husband shows up at Hamilton's office. And he says, uh, I know about this affair. And he blackmails Hamilton. And Hamilton pays him hush money. Now, uh, now Hamilton was always conflicted about whether Mariah Reynolds actually liked him and it just came to blackmail later, or whether this was a scheme from the beginning. I kind of think it was a scheme from the beginning. She and her husband were these very shady characters. Anyway, the whole thing is convoluted, but basically everyone suspects Hamilton of some sort of corruption. In part because of the Reynolds affair. Because there are these irregular payments coming out of his account. Like, people can tell, um, there's something shady going on here. And then the other thing to consider is that the temptation for an And then the other thing to consider is that the temptation for financial double dealing as Treasury Secretary would have been enormous. Yes. The pay was very low, and he has insider knowledge of tons of stuff that was likely to move markets. It would have been really easy to make a fortune dealing in government bonds, or to just instruct someone else to deal in government bonds and make a fortune on his behalf. But Hamilton was absolutely above reproach. He never gave out secrets to his friends, he never owned any government bonds, never made any trades on his own account while he was treasury secretary. This government was his creation, his baby, and he wanted to make sure that it was a sterling success. And so his behavior was always perfect in that regard. So when there starts to be some scuttlebutt about Hamilton and secret payments, he is investigated for corruption.

So when there starts to be some scuttlebutt about Hamilton and secret payments , he is investigated for corruption . These payments that are going to James Reynolds for hush money , people assume that Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: they are. And so there are some legislators assigned to be government investigators. Uh, three people, including James Monroe, future president of the United States. And so they come to Hamilton's house to confront him about these charges. And Hamilton immediately begins to tell them the story of what happened. And he produces documents, and they, and he produces documents, and he's going into details. And these three legislators are like, Cool. We believe you. Please don't tell us anything more. And Hamilton, who as I said earlier, had this just And Hamilton, who has this just shocking lack of discretion. He has this like, autistic need to say the full truth all the time. Insists on giving them all the dirty details. It's a funny scene. These investigators are like, clearly extremely uncomfortable as he's telling them like, Detailed descriptions of his liaisons with this woman, but they go home satisfied that, that Hamilton is not actually corrupt, but that he has just been kind of hoodwinked and blackmailed by this guy, but Monroe, one of the investigators asks for the documents in order to make copies. To have, um, to prove that what has actually happened here. And it turns out to be a big mistake by Hamilton to allow him, you know, any papers to leave his site. Uh, cause as it would happen, um, the, the papers end up leaking. So in 1797, after Hamilton was finished as treasury secretary, some of the documents are published in a newspaper. Monroe probably didn't intentionally leak them, but through his carelessness, they fell into the hands of some of Hamilton's enemies. And the story isn't entirely clear. You know, there's just some papers and there are still allegations that, you know, James Reynolds wasn't just blackmailing him, but that he was using him for some sort of financial malfeasance. And so Hamilton makes one of the biggest mistakes of his career. He writes and publishes something now known as the Reynolds pamphlet. It's a 95 page explanation of what had happened. And by the way, the full name of the pamphlet gives you an idea of Hamilton's verbosity. Uh, the, the full name is observations on certain documents contained in number five and six of history of the United States for the year 1796, in which the charge of speculation against Alexander Hamilton, late secretary of the treasury is fully refuted.

Okay . He was not known for his Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: brevity, Alexander Hamilton, but, uh, he writes this 95 page. Once again, he almost like had this need for catharsis, this need to get it off his chest. To say everything that had happened. I think it was like eating at him, this secrecy. And so, um, in this 95 page pamphlet, he gives all, once again, all the dirty details describes all the liaisons. And so this pamphlet that Hamilton himself writes makes him a laughing stock. Perry to paraphrase, paraphrase the, the diplomat tally Rand. It was worse than a crime. It was a blunder. I think a good comparison is with Thomas Jefferson. So Thomas Jefferson eventually becomes president. He had a slave named Sally Hemings. And he probably had sexual relations with her. She had a few children. And Thomas Jefferson was probably the father of at least one of them. And there were rumors about this. And then during Jefferson's presidency, The story was finally published in a newspaper that Jefferson is the father of this, of this half black child, uh, with, with a slave of his. And Jefferson just refused to comment, and let the story kind of die. Like, it was still out there, it was a rumor, but it couldn't totally be confirmed. And so, you know, what? The Republicans still support him, the Federalists still oppose him, you know, who cares? And that is exactly what Hamilton should have done. Like, he, he should have just not commented, and kind of let the story, Um, and let the story die on its own. Honestly, any strategy. Would have been better than what Hamilton decided to do, which was blow up the story as big as possible. Give as many details as possible. Like it's just, it was an insane response and it was a blunder. And it's probably the reason why Hamilton never decided to run for president, even before it came out, he knew that others knew, and it was likely to be used against him if he ever ran for president. So it's kind of like this sort of Damocles hanging over him the entire time for his entire political life, and the other thing that makes this, um, kind of more dangerous to him is the fact that it's at this time that political parties are first coming to existence, our first coming into existence. So George Washington ran without a political party.

They were called factions and factionalism was seen as a very deleterious and factionalism was seen as very deleterious. For a Republican form of government. Okay. You don't want people disagreeing on all this stuff and having all these strong interests and opposing each other. But I mean, realistically, political parties were probably inevitable and as fate would have it, they basically arise in response to Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison start to organize what would become the Democratic Republican party, and they were known as Republicans for short. And in response, Alexander Hamilton organizes the Federalist Party. Republicans were in favor of sm Republicans were in favor of a small federal government, stronger state governments. They favored agrarian interests, opposed banks, opposed a standing army, and wanted lower taxes, just to name some of the key issues. They were more democratic in nature and more ideologically leftist. They came to sympathize with the French revolution. Okay. And their opponents would call them Jacobins, right? They thought they were just French revolutionaries in disguise. Whereas the Federalists favored a stronger central government, they favored industrial and commercial interests, favored a strong banking system and a standing army, they wanted higher taxes to fund all of this, and they were seen as more aristocratic in their disposition. And they were seen as more aristocratic in their disposition. And they were seen as more aristocratic. They abhorred the French Revolution. They abhorred the French Revolution when it came and identified more with England, an example of how to do things and as a trading partner. Now, as you may have noticed, I said Now, as you may have noticed, I said that Jefferson led the Republican Party and Hamilton led the Federalist Party, which is a problem because they're both serving in the same administration under George Washington. There were these intense, drawn out fights between the two. They just argued all the time. They're constantly on the opposite sides of every issue. Washington usually sided with Hamilton, though not always. And increasingly, especially after his re election in 1792, Washington comes to be seen as a Federalist. He won't say he's a Federalist. He says he's nonpartisan. But the Republicans increasingly hate Washington. And everyone thinks that he is a Federalist. And all his policies, frankly, are Federalist.

And part of this is that , like Hamilton , he had this skepticism Of democracy of common people . You know , he believed that you needed intelligent , enlightened Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: people to be in charge and to manage things. Okay. And so, as I mentioned, like a lot of this is seen through the lens of the French revolution, which breaks out in 1789 during Washington's, uh, term in office, , and this was not just remote for the United States. It resulted in a number of refugees. And it was not just remote for the United States, it was personal, it was on their doorstep. Because, uh, when the French Revolution breaks out, , and especially when the terror comes, and they're executing all these people, then you have a ton of refugees fleeing France to wherever they could go. A number of them go to England, a number of them go to various places in Germany, and a number of Elected to come to the United States of America, you know, especially because America was seen as like, uh, a beacon of Republican hope. So when the terror happens, you especially have a lot of moderate revolutionaries, like moderate liberals who had initially gone with the revolution, but then they weren't extreme enough. For Robespierre, those are the kind of people oftentimes who flee to the United States of America. As the senior ranking official who spoke French more or less natively. And as someone who sympathized with those who opposed the excesses of the French revolution, Hamilton took on a role as the sort of unofficial ambassador to exiled Frenchmen. He frequently hosted dinners of prominent French exiles. He helped them set up communities and social functions and find their feet when they came to America. And it was in this capacity that he had the opportunity to intimately get to know the French diplomat, Talleyrand, who frequently shared dinners, attended events, the And it was in this capacity that he had the opportunity to intimately get to know the French diplomat, Talleyrand. And they frequently shared dinners together, they attended events, they discussed the news of the day, they became friends. And then of course, when Napoleon came to power, Talleyrand was able to go back to France, where he served as Napoleon's head diplomat. So, when in the first episode I said that Talleyrand thought that the only person who topped Napoleon as the greatest man of the epic was Hamilton, this is someone who knew what he was talking about. He was very close friends with Hamilton, got to see him work, and he was a close associate of Napoleon's as well, and got to see him work.

And he thought that Hamilton was even greater Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: than Napoleon. Okay. So, you know, you have Jefferson who says the French revolution is great. And when they start chopping off heads, he's like, well, yeah. What did you think revolution meant? Good vibes. You know, if you want to make an omelet, you got to crack some eggs. And then you've got Hamilton, who is, you know, always feared public disorder, feared the mob, and he is just aghast. He can't believe, um, that anyone would support this French Revolution. And so they are just increasingly at each other's throats. And so eventually it's like, all right, this situation can't go on. And Hamilton has kind of accomplished most of the things that he thinks he needs to. And so Jefferson and Hamilton both depart from the Washington administration during his second term, early on in Washington's second term. I like Washington's response to Hamilton's because I think it shows you how much respect. He had for him, he wrote in every relation, which you have borne to me, I have found that my confidence in your talents, exertions, and integrity has been well placed. I the more freely render this testimony of my approbation, I more freely render this testimony of my approbation, because I speak from opportunities of information which cannot deceive me, and which furnish satisfactory proof of your title to public regard. My most earnest wishes for your happiness will attend you in retirement. Okay. So Washington a little ambivalent about Jefferson who has been increasingly publicly criticizing Washington, although doing it anonymously and organizing opposition to him, even as he's serving in his administration, but he has no ambivalence towards Hamilton. Like he just really loves and respects him and appreciates what he's done for the administration. And he has done a fantastic job. I also like Ron Chernow's summary. of Hamilton's years as Treasury Secretary, And I think this passage helps hit home just how much he accomplished and how important he was to the formation of the government of the United States. Chernow writes, Whatever his disappointments, Hamilton, 40, must have left Philadelphia with an immense feeling of accomplishment. The Whiskey Rebellion had been suppressed, the country's finances flourished, and the investigation into his affairs had ended with a ringing ex and the investigation into his affairs had ended with a ringing exoneration.

Despite years of complaints and bitter smears, John Quincy Adams later stated that his financial system operated like enchantment for the restoration of public credit. Bankrupt when Hamilton took office, the United States now enjoyed a credit rating equal to that of any European nation. He had laid the groundwork for both liberal democracy and capitalism. and helped to transform the role of the president from passive administrator to active policymaker, creating the institutional scaffolding for America's future emergence as a great power. He had demonstrated the creative uses of government, he had demonstrated creative uses of government, and helped to weld the states irreversibly into one nation. He had also defended Washington's administration more brilliantly than anyone else, articulating its constitutional underpinnings and enunciating, um, enunciating key tenants of foreign policy. We look in vain for a man who in an equal space of time has produced such a direct and lasting effects upon our institutions in history. Henry Cabot Lodge was to contend okay, well, when Hamilton leaves the Washington administration, he resumes life as a lawyer, and it's worth delving a little bit into his legal career. We're gonna have to wind back the clock a little bit because he was also a private lawyer in between the end of the Revolutionary War and the beginning of his time in the Washington administration. So, winding back the clock after the, so, winding back the clock after the war, he completes a three year legal education in nine months. You didn't have to go to law school, but you had to study a set curriculum and students often compiled their notes into a notebook that covered their thoughts and takeaways on the entire body of law. Hamilton's notes, called Practical Proceedings, cover 137 pages and were used as a textbook by many New York law students for decades. And again, he did this in just nine months. He's an excellent attorney. He works himself into a passion as he is speaking, which I think is a very effective way to speak. If you start in a passion, you know, you just start, you know, you just start, you know, at full steam, then that can sound discordant and jarring to a listener who is not as passionate as you are. But if you build up to it, If you slowly gain steam and enthusiasm as you make better and better points until finally at the end, you're just fired with passion. Then, the listener comes along that journey", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/alexander-hamilton-part-1-and-2", "title": "Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2", "chunk_index": 58, "publication_date": "2024-06-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 75}}

But if you build up to it , If you slowly gain steam and enthusiasm as you make better and better points until finally at the end , you ' re just fired with passion . Then , the listener comes along that journey Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: with you, they feel that same passion that you do, so it's a very effective tactic that he uses. You may have also noticed that a lot of people talk about his eyes when they describe Hamilton. We heard that in the first episode. And in the context of being a lawyer, many people mentioned his stare. That he would stare unblinkingly, very intensely at the jury or at whoever he was examining. And I think this is interesting. It reminds me, of course, of Steve Jobs. Many people mentioned how he would just stare at you when he was talking to you. This is something that Grigory Rasputin also was famous for. It was a big part of his mystique. Anyways, this might be the biggest hack to charisma is to just look is to just lock in on people when you talk to them and fix them with a gaze. And Hamilton was known for doing that as well. If he had a weakness as a lawyer, it was the same as everything else in his life. He was a windbag. He could just go on for too long. One contemporary wrote, I used to tell him that he was not content with knocking his opponent in the head, but that he persisted until he had banished every little insect that buzzed around his ears. As a lawyer, he quickly becomes friends. Kind of frenemies, with Aaron Burr, another hotshot lawyer. They would travel the circuit together, taking cases. Sometimes they would work together on the same case, on the same side. But more often, they worked against each other. But even though they represented clients on different sides of the same case, they still had a sense of professionalism, and would go out for drinks or grab dinner together afterwards. Both Burr and Hamilton confirmed that in non political matters, they tended to get along quite well. And one reason that he needed to go to work, one reason that he needed to go back to work as a lawyer, after the Washington administration was because he wasn't making much money in the treasury department. His family was growing and he needed the income. So he's often working with big commercial cases in New York city for major, for major enterprises, where there's a fat legal fee involved. He's essentially working in big law now just because he had a thriving legal practice. That doesn't mean that he's completely done with politics and government. He continues to advise Washington who frequently writes to him asking for his advice and policy recommendations.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/alexander-hamilton-part-1-and-2", "title": "Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2", "chunk_index": 59, "publication_date": "2024-06-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 75}}

He continues to advise Washington who frequently writes to him asking for his advice and policy recommendations . Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: One of the things that he masterminds is something called the Jay Treaty. There were a number of disagreements between America and Great Britain since the war, since the end of the Revolutionary War. Britain was capturing American sailors and pressing them into service in the British military. Often these were dual citizens, people who had been English and had immigrated to America. And, um, in the eyes of Great Britain, they're like, no, you, you still owe military service. Additionally, Britain still had not evacuated some of the forts that they had promised to. Britain thought that America wasn't paying up on some of their commercial debts that were owed. There were disputes over the placement of the border between the US and Canada and the property rights of British loyalists who had had their property seized since the revolution and owner's burdens that had been placed on American trade in the Caribbean. So there are all these various legal and trade disputes. So John Jay is sent by Washington to Great Britain to negotiate a treaty. With instructions from Hamilton on what the treaty should look like. Um, probably Hamilton himself should have been sent and he was considered, but he was such a partisan figure that Jay, who was brilliant, less capable than Hamilton went in his place. You know, by this time, the Republican party led by Jefferson, like their entire platform is opposition to Hamilton. He is the boogeyman. He is the Donald Trump of his time. Okay. Not obviously Trump and Hamilton are very different, very, very different people in terms of their approach to life and their intellect, they're very different, but I'm just saying that they are similar in this one narrow regard that they are, um, the person that everyone reacts to that politics kind of revolves around. At this time, Jefferson and American leftists, they just hated him. And there were daily attacks in their newspapers on Hamilton. They accused him of colluding with Great Britain, the same way that Trump was accused, the same way that Trump was accused of colluding with Russia. He was the defining personality. He's constantly accused of monarchism. They say that he wants to end the revolution and, and take America back. They say that he wants to end the revolution and Republican government that he's betrayed everything that the American revolution stood for. And so it was probably a good call by Washington not to send Hamilton, this very divisive figure to go negotiate this treaty. The Jay Treaty, regardless, is on one hand", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/alexander-hamilton-part-1-and-2", "title": "Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2", "chunk_index": 60, "publication_date": "2024-06-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 75}}

And so it was probably a good call by Washington not to send Hamilton , this very divisive figure to go negotiate this treaty . The Jay Treaty , regardless , is on one hand Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: a huge success, and on the other, deeply unpopular. The reason that it was unpopular is that Great Britain had the greatest navy on earth. America could not compete with them, and so Britain could in many ways dictate terms. You know, maybe you're thinking, well wait, we just had the Revolutionary War, I thought America had shown that they could compete with Great Britain. And they had shown in the Revolutionary War that, Yeah, England couldn't occupy, but yeah, England couldn't occupy the United States and hold it against Americans wills, but in a more limited war, Britain could have absolutely devastated American commerce and ruined us economically. And so when the treaty comes back and Britain doesn't fully promise to stop impressing American sailors and won't fully allow the U. S. to trade with France, It looks bad. We didn't get everything that we wanted, but it is a huge success because it avoids war and it gets America a pretty good trade deal with a nation that was still by far their biggest trade partner. And this is one of those rare moments in history where you get to see the counterfactual because when Thomas Jefferson becomes president, he allows the trade because when Thomas Jefferson becomes president, he allows the Jay treaty to lapse and he pursues a bellicose attitude toward great Britain. So he basically just undoes. Everything that is done with the Jay treaty, as does, as does his successor, James Madison, who is kind of a protege of Thomas Jefferson's. And this leads to the war of 1812. Where Britain is able to maintain an effective blockade of the U. S., slap around American troops in Canada, and even march into Washington and burn down the new American capital. It's a pointless and costly conflict that gains America nothing, and it's exactly what would have happened You know, 20 years earlier, and it's exactly what would have happened, you know, 15 years earlier, if, uh, the Jay Treaty had never been passed. So, again, it's fairly unpopular, because it looks like the Washington administration is just kowtowing to England, especially with Republicans who regard it as tantamount to treason, but it's actually a very effective treaty, and Hamilton is just barely able to see it ratified in the Senate, and it becomes law. So, that is the Uh, a governmental accomplishment of Hamilton that he is the one who masterminds it, he's the one who pushes it", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/alexander-hamilton-part-1-and-2", "title": "Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2", "chunk_index": 61, "publication_date": "2024-06-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 75}}

So , that is the Uh , a governmental accomplishment of Hamilton that he is the one who masterminds it , he ' s the one who pushes it Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: through, even though he's officially not in office anymore. When Washington steps down from the presidency after two terms, eight years, he is succeeded by his vice president, John Adams. Adams is a very interesting person. He was absolutely brilliant, but at the same time, he was incredibly vain. And suspicious of his relation, but at the same time, he's incredibly vain and suspicious and just very prickly, very difficult to deal with. And his relationship with it and his relationship with Hamilton was always fraught and, um, And his relationship with Hamilton was always fraught, and then towards the end of the Washington administration, it, it really sours. It goes south. And so Adams tries to freeze Hamilton out of his administration. He doesn't want any Hamilton influence in the Adams administration. But, he makes a big mistake. He keeps all of Washington's department heads not realizing That they are all Hamilton loyalists. And so even when Hamilton is out of power, he's still kind of in power, still pulling the strings behind the scenes. Adams was as Adams, John Adams was not a very good manager. And so in absence of strong leadership, his secretaries are looking for someone to give them a strong vision, a strong direction and what they should do. And so they're often just going behind his back and back channeling with Hamilton and, and carrying out his orders. The Adams administration brings us one of the most interesting moments of Hamilton's career because there is something that happens that almost changes everything, and I mean everything. So during the Adams administration, there's something called the Quasi War, and this is an undeclared naval war between France and the U. S., okay? I think I talked about this in the Washington episode, but basically, the United States had taken out significant loans from France to fund the Revolutionary War. Well, when the French Revolution happens, the U. S. stops paying back their loans. And the French say, What are you doing? This is dishonest. You owe us all this money. And the U. S. says, We didn't have an agreement with the Republic of France. We had an agreement with the King of France. And by the way, you just chopped his head off. So, like, we don't owe you anything. In fact, like, you're enemies with the guy that we owe this money to. And, uh, and so", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/alexander-hamilton-part-1-and-2", "title": "Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2", "chunk_index": 62, "publication_date": "2024-06-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 75}}
{"text": ". And by the way , you just chopped his head off . So , like , we don ' t owe you anything . In fact , like , you ' re enemies with the guy that we owe this money to . And , uh , and so Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: there's this disagreement, right? That America thinks that their agreement was with the King of France. France says, no, it was just with France, the government of France, and you owe us this money. And so France responds by seizing American merchant ships. And so then America responds by firing back, and before you know it, you have an undeclared quasi war going on between France and America where you have these ships firing at each other. Now, it is in the midst of this quasi war that the Adams administration passes the Alien and Seditions Acts, which increased restrictions on becoming an American citizen. in part because you had all these Irish at this time immigrating into the U. S. and they were Catholic, they tended to side with the French, and they tended to have radical Republican views. And so they kind of wanted to block these people from becoming U. S. citizens and being able to vote and lending more support to the Republicans. So that is the alien part, and then the sedition part, it cracked down on a bunch of different forms of speech that were critical of the government. And so, you know, what you have at this time period is it's essentially America's first Red Scare. Okay, not many people know that the first Red Scare was actually in the 1790s. Obviously, the term communism hadn't been invented. Karl Marx wasn't on the scene yet. But the French Revolution was essentially a proto communist revolution, complete with militant atheism, the upending of social norms, radical taxation, and it had the ideological pull in the same way that communism did in the 20th century. And Adams and Hamilton and these guys are anti communists in the same way that someone like McCarthy was. And they take many of the same actions in order to try and stamp it out. Jefferson and Madison and the Republicans were of course sympathetic to this line of revolutionary thought. In fact, Hamilton wrote that he thought that if France tried to invade the U. S., That Jefferson and the Republican party would form a fifth column to support them. So, so it's in this hyper partisan context and in the context of this quasi war that Adams decides that America needs to prepare for war. An army is raised, Washington is put in charge of it, and Washington says, Hey, I'm only going to take this position if Hamilton can be my number two. And by the way, I'm old now. I don't plan", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/alexander-hamilton-part-1-and-2", "title": "Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2", "chunk_index": 63, "publication_date": "2024-06-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 75}}

I don ' t plan Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: on doing a whole lot. So really Hamilton is going to be in charge of this defensive army to protect us from France. And Adams says, no way. I hate that guy. I hate Hamilton. But he basically gets overridden. Washington says, sorry, it's the only way I'm taking this position. Everyone knows that Washington has to lead the army. And so finally Adams has to throw his hands up and say, fine, you know, have it your way. And so Hamilton gets put in charge of this new expanding American army. Now the Revolutionary Wars are going on in Europe, France doesn't exactly have the flexibility to launch a transatlantic invasion of the United States. So what is this army going to do? And Hamilton draws up a plan. He wants to invade French owned Louisiana, And then invade Spanish controlled Florida. Spain was allied with France at the time, and then launch an invasion of South America, starting with Venezuela. These plans were drawn up without presidential authority or approval. And I think Hamilton was serious about them. He had this unbelievable ambition for military glory. And, um, and that hadn't been completely sated by the revolutionary war. And if he had done this, uh, you know, Louisiana would not have been a problem. Florida would not have been a problem. South America, like, okay, That's stretching it. Could the U S really have funded an invasion of South America? And, um, could the U S really have funded invasion of South America? I don't know, but if anyone could have pulled it off. It would have been Hamilton. And if he had, if he had pulled this off, if he had returned from South America at the back of victorious army with an entire continent of profitable colonies that he had personally won at his back. You know, what would Hamilton have done? I still don't think in the end that he would have launched a coup. He cared too much about the United States, the constitution, this government that he had really built with his own hands. I think that this was the accomplishment that he was most proud of. I think in the final conclusion, he wouldn't have dismantled it, but also, I mean, I don't know why else do you plan military adventures without presidential approval? I mean, if anyone was capable of pulling off. A coup and, and, you know, running America by military dictatorship.

A coup and , and , you know , running America by military dictatorship . It was Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: Hamilton. So I know this is not typically how we think of Hamilton, but I think there is a chance that Hamilton could have become the American Napoleon and reigned officially as president, but with more or less monarchical powers. And if that had happened, I think he either would have flamed out like Napoleon, you know, embroiled the U S in so many wars that he eventually just lost everything, or he would have made the U S a world power by like 1830. With significant colonies all over the world, especially the Americas. And challenged great Britain for world supremacy with basically nothing in between, like either he would have flamed out or he would have made America a great world empire a hundred years before it did eventually happen. So, you know, I'm a little torn on this. Obviously I'm glad things turned out the way they did and that we have a democratic Republic and, uh, the U S is great love, love American history as it happened, but I don't know, there is something kind of attractive that it would have just been interesting to see what Hamilton really could have done. With a great army at his back and with kind of despotic powers. , I really think he would have pushed America forward. , at what cost of course is the question, but it's just, it's interesting to consider. As it happened, Adams negotiated a peace treaty with France, which completely undercut the need for an army and Adams disbanded it as it happened. Adams negotiated a peace treaty with France. Which completely undercut the need for an army. And then president Adams disbands this new army at the first possible moment, destroying any possibility of carrying out any of this. And this peace treaty that Adams signs was controversial in and of itself with the Federalists. They opposed it for much the same reason that the Republicans opposed the Jay treaty. Their domestic partisanship had an international bent. And so peace with France was peace with the hated Jacobins. It's like, you know, you're, you're compromising with the commies. So anyway, similar to the Jay treaty, it is actually a good move for the United States. It brings peace. It brings economic prosperity, even though it's not popular with one of the parties, you know, it was the right move. And Hamilton, And Adams didn't do himself any favors in passing it. He went about it in a very weird way. He didn't consult anyone else.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/alexander-hamilton-part-1-and-2", "title": "Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2", "chunk_index": 65, "publication_date": "2024-06-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 75}}

He didn ' t consult anyone else . Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: He kind of quixotically sends this secret delegation to France and, um, and negotiates a peace treaty in secret. And so, um, and so it's a good decision to do this peace treaty, but it's carried out in a sub optimal way. And this has political implications, um, for Adams down the line as he's alienating his Federalist base. Hamilton actually struggled with depression throughout his life. He would, he would have these violent mood swings and really go into a deep funk. And this was a moment of deep depression for him. After this peace treaty is signed, Washington has just died. His political influence had in a matter of just a few years gone from the most powerful man in the nation. to very little influence. And, you know, this is at the same time that the Reynolds affair is becoming public, and now his dreams of military glory are dashed forever as well as Adams dismantles this army. So it is in this funk that Hamilton makes the third great mistake of his career. The first was his speech at the Constitutional Convention espousing some form of monarchy. Uh, that came back to bite him. The second great mistake was the Reynolds pamphlet. And the third is this anti Adams pamphlet that Hamilton writes. It's written as a private document meant to be circulated among powerful Federalist politicians. And it's supposed to serve as an argument for why Adams should be kicked off the ticket for president in 1800 and replaced with a friend of his named Charles Pinckney. It's a total coll It's a total character assassination. He gets stories and quotes from current and former government officials. He airs all the dirty laundry of the Adams administration. He talks about his temper, his vanity, his lack of communication, his poor leadership. Hamilton brings up his own personal grievances, which makes this just seem petty. And absurdly, he ends it by offering a tepid endorsement of Adams. He just totally destroys his character and then says, But of course, we can't have Jefferson, so vote for him, I guess, if we can't have Pinckney. Now this again is supposed to be a private letter, but of course, of course, this letter leaks like, obviously it's so predictable that this is going to get out. And so, and so Hamilton has gifted the Republicans a full repudiation of Adams.

By the founder of the Federalist party , just weeks before the election for president , it totally fails in its stated goal of Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: getting the Federalists to nominate Pinckney and only succeeds in damaging Adams on the eve of an election. And so Adams has kind of alienated himself from Federalists. Well, now Hamilton is also alienating himself from the Federalist party, uh, because you know, he's, he's attacking the leader of the party and destroying their chances. I get the impression that none of this would have happened if Washington was still alive. The monarchy speech happened when he wasn't working for Washington, the Reynolds pamphlet was written after he left the Washington administration, and this anti Adams screed was written after Washington's death. It is true that Hamilton was the greater genius of the two, but Washington had the better judgment, and a more even keel. And so, I just think if Washington had still been around and he had gotten an early look at this paper, he would have said, Hamilton, you cannot write this. You got to put this away. Like, this is idiotic. What are you thinking? And he just had great judgment and that always balanced out Hamilton. They truly made each other better and Hamilton really lost his way without Washington. Now, the Federalists were in trouble even before Hamilton wrote this and most historians agree that Adams probably would have lost anyway. But this really sealed it. And so the 1800 election totally wipes out the Federalists, not just at the presidential level, but in local elections as well. They would never have another president in the White House again. The Republicans were totally ascendant and the Federalists are just kind of now a permanent minority party. They have no real share in, uh, in the power, in the power structure of the United States. Part of this was that some of their policies were unpopular. You know, again, they were kind of elitist. , and part of it was structural changes figured out by Aaron Burr. So early on in the United States, voting rights were limited to white landowning males. Well, that heavily favors the Federalists, who are the party of the upper middle class and the merchant class. Well, Aaron Burr runs a very effective campaign in New York. He completely turns over the state and wins it for Republicans. And one of the ways that he does this is finding a loophole that poorer farmers could pool their landownings to help them all qualify to vote. And so he uses this loophole to greatly expand the electorate, especially among poor German immigrants, of which there were a lot in those days. That was the first, like,", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/alexander-hamilton-part-1-and-2", "title": "Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2", "chunk_index": 67, "publication_date": "2024-06-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 75}}

That was the first , like , Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: wave of mass immigration to the United States, was Germans and to a lesser extent Irish. And so this is a strategy that has a long history in the United States. If you can't convince voters, go find new ones, and Aaron Burr is really a, um, pioneer in that regard. Well, Burr does such a good job that Thomas Jefferson feels compelled to add him to the ticket. This is the man who won New York. For the Federalists, huge, huge feat. So he's on the ticket and the Federalists are repudiated so thoroughly that on election day, the vote count is actually tied, but not with John Adams, but between the two Republicans, Jefferson and Burr. So it's a little confusing, but in those days, if you ran for vice president, you did that by running for president and then getting the second most votes. That was who became vice president back then. So with the vote tied, it goes to the house of representatives where there is still a tie. It goes to the house of represent. So with the vote tied, it goes to the House of Representatives. So with the vote tied, it goes to the House of Representatives. They vote on it. Actually, there's a tie in the House too, and no one can break this deadlock. Now the plan for the Republicans the entire time is for Jefferson to be president and Burr to be vice president. But Burr is seen as the more moderate of the two. He'd kind of drifted between the Federalists and the Republicans. So there are a lot of Federalists who are tempted to throw the election to Burr. And Burr sees this and he actually starts campaigning a little bit. He's like, yeah, that wouldn't be the worst thing. You know, just, I know I was supposed to be vice president, but, uh, if you guys want to vote for me, I could become president, I'd be better than Jefferson. Don't you think Federalists? And, um, so it looks like this really might happen. The Federalists might throw the election to Burr. But Hamilton comes riding in and says, do not do this. He writes to a leading Federalist Congressman and says, quote, as to Burr, there is nothing in his favor. His private character is not defended by his most partial friends. He is bankrupt beyond redemption, except by the plunder of his country.

He is bankrupt beyond redemption , except by the plunder of his country . His public principles have no other spring or aim Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: than his own aggrandizement. If he can, he will certainly disturb our institutions to secure to himself permanent power and with it wealth. He is truly the Catiline of America. Okay. So this is just like a blistering indictments and insult on his character. And it's kind of crazy, right? Because I mean, at least, you know, bird didn't have any principles. That means he could be swayed, but in the end, Hamilton preferred a man in Jefferson, whose values he desperately opposed to a man with no values at all. And add to that, that yes, he radically opposes Republicanism, he opposes Jefferson, but he intuited correctly as it turned out that the presidency would have a moderating effect on Jefferson. So there are a lot of people who preach radical doctrines until they get into power and then they feel the weight. of that, and then they feel the weight of that responsibility. And then they act more moderately. And Jefferson was one of those. You know, the Jefferson presidency, definitely a mixed record, but he wasn't terrible. He certainly wasn't as bad as you would have believed if you analyzed his political statements from the 1790s when he was saying that the French Revolution was a great thing, and if some heads get chopped off, then hey, you know, that's what you got to do. He didn't govern anything like that, thankfully. And part of the reason also that Hamilton, , tries to throw the election to Jefferson is that he was able to get some Federalists to talk to him, and they secure some promises from Jefferson in exchange for getting him the Federalist vote. So he promised not to mess with the Navy or the public credit system. He would actually go back on a number of those promises, and he said, I never actually promised anything. These were just discussions. Anyway are enough to, these discussions these discussions are enough to sway the Federalists, and they vote for Jefferson and make him president over Burr. And so if, if Hamilton had been depressed during the Adams presidency, especially the end of the Adams presidency, now it gets even worse.

Perhaps no man in the United States has sacrificed or done more for the present constitution than myself . And contrary Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: to all my anticipations of its fate, as you know from the very beginning, I am still laboring to prop, I am still laboring to prop the frail and worthless fabric. Yet I have the murmur of its friends no less than the curses of its foes for my rewards. What can I do better than withdraw from the scene? Every day proves to me more and more that this American world was not made for me. And I actually agree. Like, uh, the American president, Woodrow Wilson, commented that Alexander Hamilton was indisputably a great man, but perhaps not a very good American. And that strikes me as true in some way. He was a man fitted for autocratic rule and military adventure. He did not suffer fools easily, and he did not take well to discussion and democratic politics. And what we see here is, is the end result of that. And things would only get worse from there at the beginning of the Jennifer at the beginning. And things would only get worse from there. It's during this time that Hamilton's oldest and brightest son, Philip Hamilton has a run in with another young man. Yeah. Escalates into a feud and then into a duel and 19 year old Philip Hamilton Is shot and dies, this death of his son sends Hamilton into a really deep depression. And like I mentioned, he had had bouts of depression before, but you wouldn't know it from looking at his output. He was always able to power through them and to stay productive, even when internally, you know, he was suffering from deep depression. But now for the first time, he finds himself in such deep despair over the loss of his son. You that he really sinks into it and slows down. He becomes much more religious at this time, spends more of his time in study and prayer. Uh, he never was able to bring himself to fully turn himself over to a particular congregation. He was never a regular church goer, uh, but he becomes very personally devout and spends a lot of time in religious study. Of course, like, even in depressed semi retirement. This means he's only accomplishing about twice as much as you or me, instead of ten times as much. He still writes in the newspapers. He takes on one of the most prominent court cases in the history of the United States. Um, that was very influential to the current day.

Um , he ' s found some new institutions , like he ' s still doing stuff , but Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: it's a much slower pace and, um, and a much different person and a kind of more sober person than he was before. Now Burr is kind of now persona non grata. Like, He's had these blistering attacks from Hamilton, who has told all the Federalists, do not under any circumstances trust Burr. But he's also burned his bridges with the Republicans by trying to subvert Jefferson and become president. So he is a man without a home, and in the 1804 election, he is kicked off, he is kicked off the ticket, and Jefferson is now running with a new vice president. He had come so close to the very top of political power, just a few votes away. And then, through the actions of Hamilton, He had lost it all. And so Burr tries to have some sort of comeback. Uh, he tries to run for governor of New York and the Federalists are such a spent force at this point that they don't even try to recruit a candidate for governor of New York. And so Burr runs as a Republican. hoping to unite the Federalists with the more moderate Republicans. And sure, like, that sounds like a winning coalition. The problem is, once again, Hamilton launches a full broadside against him, just rakes him over the coals in the Federalist press, and tells all of his friends, like, do not support, and tells all of his friends, do not support Burr. He's a horrible person. Now, as we've said, Hamilton did not have the influence that he used to. He's no longer the big party leader that he used to. And he's probably not the reason that Burr lost the election. But Burr was still smarting from Hamilton's intervention four years earlier, which may have actually been decisive and cost him the presidency. And this just adds insult to injury. They's campaigning so hard against him in a race that he's not likely to win anyway. And so it's at this point when Hamilton is campaigning against Burr for governor of New York, that his animosity hardens into true hatred. He just, loathes Hamilton, hates everything about him, can barely bring himself to say his name.

Because Hamilton was more religious at this point in his life , he was philosophically opposed to Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: dueling. But he also in the back of his mind still had some vague aspirations of a political comeback and any hope of a comeback rested on his reputation as a war hero. So And he thought that charges of cowardice would doom his political career forever. Like, that removes kind of the shine of being a war hero. He's very jealous of his reputation as, as someone who was brave and someone who was a gentleman. And so even though he's opposed in principle to dueling, he agrees to the duel with Ehrenberg. He doesn't tell his family to spare them the mental anguish of anticipation. And there are a couple of weeks of negotiation to see if, uh, you know, their friends kind of come to them and are like, can't we work this out peacefully? And actually at first it's Hamilton who's very intransigent. He's like, I won't apologize for the things I said. I won't retract them. Uh, eventually Hamilton kind of relents and is like, ah, well, let's find a way here. But by that time, Burr is so upset that he won't relent. And he says, no, no, no, there's no peace to be found here. This duel is going to happen. I find the events of the night before very touching. The Hamiltons were always taking in orphans. So Hamilton had this very special affinity for orphans because of his own childhood. And an orphan boy who was living with them asks Hamilton to read to him, uh, before bed, the night before the duel. And this orphan falls asleep on him and Hamilton sleeps the whole night with this orphan in his arms. Perhaps I think here at the end of his life, his mind went back to the beginning of his life. In the morning, he was picked up by a friend and taken to Manhattan, where he boarded a boat to cross the Hudson river to a small patch of land, As a sop to his conscience, he had determined not to fire at Burr. He would conspicuously throw away his shot, hopefully opening up an avenue for Burr to do the same. He believed that Burr wouldn't shoot to kill, and after all, Burr still had political aspirations. And Hamilton believed, correctly as it turned out, That to kill a defenseless man who had just thrown away his shot would be political suicide.

And so on the morning of July 11th , 1804 , Burr and Hamilton observed Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: all the rituals of a duel. They chose their pistols. They each stood ten paces apart. The signal was given for them to begin. Hamilton raised his gun and fired it into the air well above Burr's head. Burr then took aim at Hamilton's abdomen and fired. The bullet ripped through his liver and diaphragm before shattering one of his vertebrae. Hamilton was immediately paralyzed from the waist down, and began to experience massive internal bleeding. He almost died in the boat as it crossed the Hudson River, but the doctor managed to revive him. He lingered for another 30 hours, enough time for him to say a tearful goodbye to his wife and his children. and some close friends before dying on July 12th, 1804. The public grief in New York was immense. The city had never seen anything like it. Even when Washington had died, you know, he had been a less controversial public figure, but he also wasn't a man in the prime of his life with seven young children. And so there's this massive funeral attended by everyone in New York, and for 30 days, New Yorkers wore black bands on their arms to mourn the passing of Hamilton. Hamilton was correct that this completely ruined Burr's political career. He had no future. And he kind of scratched out a living on the frontier of America, crafting up these kind of harebrained schemes to invade Mexico and make himself emperor that never came to anything. And the, and the end of the story is just, it's so unsatisfying to me. I, I hate to talk about it or even think about it. To see genius stuffed out To see a genius, a mind like Hamilton snuffed out so insensibly is just, anyway, anyway, let's move on. What are our takeaways from the life, the great life of Alexander Hamilton? I'll go more into it. I'll give a full rundown of the playbook, the Hamilton playbook, uh, in the next episode. But for now, the first is this idea of monarchy. Great things are only brought into being by a single unified vision. Every corporation is a monarchy. It has one CEO. And America needed just a touch of monarchy, especially at its inception, to give it that, that vision and that direction. And so, um, I think in everything, there needs that strength. And so I think every endeavor needs that strength of vision. And I think, Hamilton was correct in that regard. The second takeaway is", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/alexander-hamilton-part-1-and-2", "title": "Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2", "chunk_index": 73, "publication_date": "2024-06-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 75}}
{"text": "that , that vision and that direction . And so , um , I think in everything , there needs that strength . And so I think every endeavor needs that strength of vision . And I think , Hamilton was correct in that regard . The second takeaway is Alexander Hamilton Part 1 and 2: Hamilton's work style. I don't know that it works for everyone, but I think it's definitely worth experimenting with. That idea of think, think, think, um, until it's fully formed in your head, then sleep on it, and then write out your thoughts fully formed. The third takeaway is to read and study broadly. Hamilton was able to be so successful because he could pull in so much knowledge from so many different domains. From law and journalism, military science, history, literature, poetry, medicine, monetary policy, manufacturing, trade, finance. He was one of those people who was both broad and deep in his knowledge. My fourth takeaway is to have a vision that is bigger than yourself. Aaron Burr didn't. And even though he lived on that July 11th day, nothing he did outlived him. Whereas Hamilton was able to give birth to something that bears his imprint up to the current day. And then lastly, I'll just mention that we should learn from his weaknesses too. And it's difficult. And then lastly, I'll just mention that we should learn from his weaknesses too. And so, you know, that lack of discretion did him in a number of times. And it's difficult because I think his lack of discretion was the flip side of just the endless torrent of productivity that came out of his mind, but he should have been more discreet. And knowing when to stay silent is an art of its own. Okay. This was a long episode, but man, I just really love Hamilton and his contributions were so vast. And, um, I have him to thank for this wonderful country that I call my home. So, uh, I hope you enjoyed this very long part two on the life of Alexander Hamilton. That does it until next time.

{"text": "Joan of Arc: Hello and welcome to How to Take Over the World. This is Ben Wilson. On today's episode, we are talking about Joan of Ark. Joan of Ark is a name that many people have heard and a lot of people don't know that much about. It's an amazing and frankly, miraculous story. One of the most improbable stories of all time is what I think, as I have read in history, I have never. a story like this of someone who should have been nowhere near the levers of power. She was a a French girl. She was a peasant girl from the middle of nowhere, and she eventually rises to, she calls herself the chef, the gale, the, uh, the, essentially like the commander in chief, the leader of the armed forces, and completely turns the. Of a war. It's an incredible story, , about persistence, about vision. It's a story that forces us to reckon with the divine, I think, which is really interesting. Uh, it's a story of a great woman and the difficulties and the contradictions that that entailed in medieval Europe. It is both a great war drama. And at the same time, it's a shockingly small and personal story about a 16 year old girl and her convictions and beliefs, and I also think it's a masterclass on how to motivate others and how to inspire them in a cause. I have loved learning about this story and I think you'll love it too. Before we get started, I want to give a quick shout out to Ellie May, who convinced me that this was a story worth telling and helped me with the research and writing on this. She's great. You can find her on Twitter at l underscore limay. I've linked her Twitter profile in the show notes, so go give her a follow and let's do it. Let's dive in to the story of Joan of Arc after this word from our sponsors. üìç for anyone trying to accomplish great things, there is nothing more important than focus. there's a great story of Bill Gates and Warren Buffet meeting together and someone asks, what was the most important attribute for your success?

And that's why I'm excited to partner with today's sponsor, capitally. They're on a mission to help founders raise money insanely.

I think unless you understand the broader conflict, it's difficult to understand how strange, uh, it was that this, this girl kind of appears in the middle of this war and, and does what she does. So let, let's start off with the basics. England had been trying to invade France for a long time. , and that might seem funny because , our story will, will take place in the early 14 hundreds. And at the time, England was a country of about 2 million people and France was a country of about 20 million. And so it seems backwards that this country that's a 10th of the size is trying to invade this, this much larger country. , but there had been a longstanding claim of the English Kings to the French throne and that was because, uh, the two royal families intermarried quite. and also because, uh, England was sort of economically ascendant at this time. There were, there were some larger forces that led them to punch above their weight, you could say, to be more powerful than they should have been given the raw manpower that was available to them. And then in the very early 14 hundreds, uh, something happens that destabilizes France a little bit. There's this guy, king Charles, king Charles the sixth, and he ascends to the throne.

His father dies early , so he ' s only 11 Joan of Arc: years old. And so what happens is the French kingdom starts to be pulled apart by, uh, his uncles, by these dukes. So you can think of Dukes as like governors, right? They're below the king. They control large amounts of territory, um, but not the entire kingdom. And so they start to empty. The coffers of France start to take power for themselves. And so Charles grows up in troubled times and grows up with a lot of stresses, a lot of people fighting over him, and, uh, and surrounded by a lot of violence and instability. And perhaps because of a consequence of that, uh, Charles, the. goes crazy. And I mean, crazy, crazy. So there are a number of incidents, uh, in one, he thinks he's made of glass, and so he tries to have, a contraption made for him with iron bars to help hold them together so that he won't accidentally shatter in another. He claims to not know his family. He, he looks at his wife and says, who is this in? He, he starts to believe that everyone around him is, uh, is plotting to kill him. And so he goes on a killing spree. He, he kills five people before he is restrained five people in his court who are kind of part of his retina and, and around him. And so, um, that leads to some instability as well, because he is not fit to rule. And what that means is that there are other people in the court who are vying to kind of be the power behind the king, right? They're vying to be the person who really controls the kingdom of France for whatever reason. This guy Charles, again, this is Charles the sixth. He is known as, uh, Charles. The Charles the well. Apparently he was a very nice and agreeable guy. People loved him when he was lucid. I don't know that even when he was lucid, he was a great leader, but he was very likable. He's, He was well liked if, if not necessarily well respected. , but that's not the only nickname he had. The Well Beloved. He's also known as Charles the Mad, unsurprisingly. Now I mentioned some of these divisions. There are two main camps, Orleans and Burgundy. Okay? And these are two of the more powerful regions in France. and so it's complicated.

And these are two of the more powerful regions in France . and so it ' s complicated . I Joan of Arc: won't get into all of it, but you know, the people from the Orlene, the, the, the Orlene family I guess you could call them, are marrying into the royal family and trying to take certain positions and trying to control France. And the people from the Burgundy family are doing the same. And at first there are kind of rules in terms of how far people can take things. Uh, but then the Duke of Burgundy kind of breaks the rules. And so one night, Lewis of Orleans. The Duke of Orleans. Uh, so the, the head of this Orleans family, I guess you could say, uh, is walking through Paris one night and some bandits come out of the shadows and club him to death. Really gruesome and really brutally, I think they they strike so hard. At one point, his, his left hand or left arm is nearly taken. . and it's very obvious to everyone that these were not just some random bandits. These were men sent by the Duke of Burgundy to do his dirty work. And so this basically spills over into Civil War. At first, it's kind of a cold civil war. It's just minor skirmishes, uh, but it moves more and more towards an actual real civil war. And so the King of England, whose name is Henry the fifth. takes a look at this and says, okay, there are serious divisions within France. Now is a good time to take advantage and press my claim to be the King of France. And so in 1415, he sails from England to Normandy which is a region in Northern France. and starts by besieging, a city called Har Fluer. They are successful eventually and take the city of Harlo, but it takes much longer than it should have. And in the meantime, the siege is not done particularly well. They dam a river and it floods and it causes a lot of disease and dysentery in English camp. So yes, they take their immediate goal, which is the city of Harlo, but it basically takes the entire summer, the entire campaign season, and at the end of. Half their troops aren't able to to fight anymore because they, they all have dysentery. But King Henry can't really just take this one city and turn around and go back to England with his tail between his legs.

And so that Joan of Arc: will prove, look, I can march my troops through France, through Normandy. I'm really in control here. Uh, even though he wasn't, it's kinda a fool hearted decision. And as he's doing this march through Normandy, the French troops show up and the, uh, the camps of Orleans and Burgundy have put aside their differences and they've all come together to form this joint French army to attack the English who were in their territory. And they catch up to the English army , Near a town called Acor, and this is one of the most famous battles of all time. The English essentially have no knights. They're outnumbered at least two to one. The numbers are a little disputed. They are cut off from all their supplies. There's just, they have no chance. Right. Yet they win somewhat miraculously, I would love to break it down some other time. Maybe I'll do an episode on Henry the fifth. , but this lends some credence people to start to say, oh wow, maybe this Henry, the fifth guy, you know, is really destined to be that guy, destined to be the the King of France, and he's able to lead his troops to Colay and go back to England now. It was kind of such a debacle that he had to take a few years off from this invasion of France and kind of regroup and raise more troops. And in the meantime, while Henry is gone, the civil War between the Burgundians and, uh, and the guys from Orleans resumes. Um, the actual, the side from Orleans comes to be known as the Armon yachts after a, a count who's, who's with them and ends up kind of being important in, in all of it. So that, that's the important thing to know is that we're in France, there's kind of this threat looming of England, and there's the Armon Ys and the Burgundians. So when Henry II returns to France, he doesn't have any trouble landing and getting his troops established. Uh, one chronicler wrote quote, no one did anything about it because all the French lords were angry with each other because the prince was at odds with his father on account of the Duke of Burgundy who was with the king. Okay? So that's the basic balance of power. The King, king Charles, the mad, was with the Burgundians. His son the Prince", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/joan-of-arc", "title": "Joan of Arc", "chunk_index": 4, "publication_date": "2023-02-24", "total_chunks_in_doc": 44}}

The King , king Charles , the mad , was with the Burgundians . His son the Prince Joan of Arc: who was called the Dohan, was with the Armon yachts. And now King Henry is in, uh, is in France as well. And so for a time there are these shifting alliances. So anytime someone starts to get too much power, then the other two sides will sign a truce and start to work with each other. And it's interesting because, you know, there's this propaganda, especially the French really hate each other, these burgundians and these Armon Ys cuz it's a civil war, right? They can't believe they have betrayed one another. Uh, at one point the Armon yacht propaganda calls John the Duke of Burgundy quote, the dearest and well beloved lieutenant of Lucifer. King of hell. And then like weeks later, they sign a truce with him, right? . So it's, they can vacillate very quickly between, okay, we're working with you and you are literally the most well beloved lieutenant of Lucifer, the devil. Well, finally, the English are getting too powerful. Henry I fifth was an amazing leader and a powerful military commander. And so he's making some real headway. And so the arm yachts and the burgundians can see, okay, we need to set aside our differences and team up for the good of France and defeat the English. So they come together for a peace agreement. They start to hammer it out. The only thing that's left is to really seal it, to do the handshake right? And say, okay, we're doing this. So they set up a handshake deal. It's a very complicated affair because, everyone is sort of scared of assassination. And so, , the do fan who is, again, that's the French word they used to mean prince. It means he's the heir to the throne. So the dohan at this time is still just a boy. And again, you have these kind of paws, right? So the King, king Charles, the mad is with the burgundians. But he's not making any decisions. He's essentially like their mascot. They keep him around as a form of legitimacy. Look, the king is with us, but the king's not making any decisions.

And so the Dohan, who is a young man, is supposed to meet with, uh, John the Duke of Burgundy, and they have it all set out that they're going to cross a bridge meet in the middle of the bridge. You have 10 men stand here. I have 10 men stand here, and they kind of do it on, uh, they do it on Armonk territory. So the DFA is really the one who's in charge. And so they do this, they all come together, there's a handshake deal, and in order to kind of, seal it, the Duke of Burgundy kneels down before the Dohan. And as he does so, One of, uh, the Armon yachts, one of the do defense men takes up his ax and caves in the Duke of Burgundy's head, kills him with his ax, and then people swarm him and start stabbing him for good measure. And so this was payback, uh, because this is the same guy, the Duke of Burgundy, who had previously killed the Duke of Orleans, had had those people in in Paris come and, and hack at him with clubs and, and, and kill him. And so they're paying him back, right? This is very Game of Thrones type stuff. But in some ways, this killing was worse than, uh, than what John the Duke of Burgundy had done previously because, You know, you can think of it like a mob hit, right? There's such a thing as a fair mob hit. What, what's okay to do and what's not okay to do? And what's okay to do is get a guy when he's in the street, but what's not okay to do is take someone in your protection, lie to them, say, it's okay, we're gonna make a deal. And then under those auspices, have him killed. There, there were sort of expectations and customs around hospitality and breaking those was a big no-no. And so the burgundians are very, very upset after, uh, after this assassination. They already would've been upset after an assassination, but this seems particularly gross and egregious and evil.

{"text": "after this assassination . They already would ' ve been upset after an assassination , but this seems particularly gross and egregious and evil . And so the burgundians are like , forget it , we ' re going with the English and so we ' ve got the Armon Joan of Arc: Ys on one side who include really most of France. And then we've got Burgundy, which is a smaller part of France, but honestly some of the most prosperous, um, some of the richest parts of France. And they're teamed up with the English. And these two sides are about to start fighting. The Burgundians in the English come together and they have Henry the fifth, who's the King of England, Mary, uh, a princess, the daughter of Charles the mad. And so this brings a lot of legitimacy because if, if Henry is able to have a son with this woman that makes him obviously the king of England, but also have a really, really strong claim to France as well, even stronger than Henry the fifth So they've got a strong claim and they've got an amazing leader in Henry the fifth as well. He's great on the battlefield. Great. In the throne room, you know, five tool player as they say in the N F L. The guy can do everything. I, uh, I, I could do an episode on, on Henry fifth. I, I probably will. Shakespeare already did, and. and the English and Burgundians are winning as long as he's around. He does leave and go back to England for a while. He leaves his brother Thomas in charge. Thomas really messes things up and he charges into the fray, immediately gets himself killed and loses a major battle. So Henry the fifth has to come back, and when he comes back, now he's got a son. Uh, he, he was able to, to father a son with this princess of France. And so this kid is like the most anticipated child of all time in Western Europe. They call him Henry the sixth. And this kid has more claims in England and France than anyone has ever had. He's born into more power than than a person ever has been. And it seems clear to me that if things had gone on like this, Henry the fifth is going to keep winning battles. . He's gonna make quick work of the Armon Ys. All the momentum is with him, and he's gonna be the King of England and France, and he's gonna leave those thrones to his son. They would've won, but he dies of dysentery.

{"text": "France , and he ' s gonna leave those thrones to his son . They would ' ve won , but he dies of dysentery . This is one of these sliding doors , moments , but now things get more complicated because again , the next king is just Joan of Arc: an infant. So, Whereas before you had the Armon Ys who are really divided, they don't have a, a great leader because, you know, their king is, uh, is just a young man and can't lead yet. And you have the English and the Burgundians who are led by King Henry the fifth. This really strong leader. Now, the English and the Burgundians are led by committee as well. And so also don't have as strong of leadership. And so the, it seems like the Armon Ys have a little bit more of a chance now. . But in the immediate wake of the death of Henry the fifth, his brother, who's called the Duke of Bedford, takes over as a, as the head guy of England in France. And he's not as flashy. He's not as spectacular as his brother Henry, but the Duke of Bedford is the ultimate, get the job done guy. He's just very, very competent. So he takes charge of the forces, . He leads them at a battle with the Armon Ys called The Battle of Ver Nu. And once again, the French outnumber the English should win and they lose spectacularly. And so now they've got like half the country under, under their rule. They actually take Paris, which is symbolically very important because it's the capital and, and the heart of France. And they're winning. They're pushing further and further South And the English are gonna take control of basically all the heartland, the main parts of France. and to add to that, they're already losing and now there's start to be some inviting, some, some civil wars within the arm side. So what's going really, really poorly English. Move in and besiege the city of Orleans. And that's important because the thing though was still holding them back from fully being able to take over all of France was this river, the Lair River. And so the, the Armon Ys could still hold the English back, uh, along the lair cuz it's difficult to cross. But Orleans is one of these cities that sits right on the lair. And so if they can take it, that is a crossing that's going to put them right in the middle of, of the Armon y territory.

Since they didn ' t control Paris anymore , the Dohan had moved his capital to a city called Borjas and it ' s a pretty straight Joan of Arc: shot from Orleans to bs. So they're gonna be in, in big, big trouble if England is able to take the city of Orleans. There is a arm commander named the Bastard of Orleans. So his brother, or his half-brother, I should say, was actually the Duke of Orleans. But he had been captured by the English back at the Battle of Acor. And so he was still being held prisoner now, like a decade later in England. So the bastard of Orleans, um, , takes some French troops and tries to relieve the siege, uh, on his home city, uh, uh, the city of Orleans. And they attack, and the archers take out all these nights. The bastard of Orleans is injured in the foot. Uh, many French Knight are either killed or captured. And so the bastard of Orleans has to literally and figuratively limp back and say, uh, I, I failed to relieve the siege. And so it looks like it's only a matter of time until Orleans is going to be taken. That is the gateway to Armon y territory. Armon Ys have a bunch of infighting still. There's not good relations between their own forces. They're really on their heels. It looks like the English are just one strong campaign from taking it all. These Armon y Pretenders people are calling 'em the Kingdom of Borges, which is supposed to be an insult, right? Because their capital isn't even in Paris. It's in this other city. So this kingdom of Borges looks like it'll fall with the faintest push. And then 11 days later, a peasant girl named Joan walks into the court of the Dohan, Charles the seventh, and she changes everything. And I'll be telling you the rest of her story after this quick break to hear from another one of our sponsors. üìç Have you ever gone into a restaurant and you thought, nice, I only spent $25 on that meal, and then the bill comes back and then you add in the drink and the tax and the appetizer and you actually spent like $55 and you think, how did that happen?

She was from a small remote village called Do Remi in the very far northeast of France. She was a peasant girl. All her family were peasants. She had a very normal upbringing. She sows, she spins wool, she cares for goats. She's very religious. And at age 12 she hears a voice. She thinks it comes from behind her. She looks around, she doesn't see anyone, and the voice begins to speak to her and to tell her things, things that she should do. Eventually this voice becomes two voices and then three voices. The voices identify themselves. They are that of St. Michael, St. Catherine, and St. Margaret Saints that she was familiar with and were important in the Catholic cannon. They tell her to do things, never evil or bad things the things that they tell her to do are simple. The things that you would expect a young girl to do. She's to listen to her mother, she's to always pray. She's to obey the commandments that she learns in church, and so that's what she does, but eventually their instructions change and they give her this plan of what we she needs to do. She is going to end this war. She's going to eject the English from France and restore the Dohan, the prince, to the throne of France.

She's going to go to the Dohan, she's gonna present herself to him. She's gonna lead the French forces. She's gonna leave the siege of Orleans, and then she's going to march the Armon Yk forces to the city of ROMs. And, um, this city rams, it looks like it's spelled reams. Ah, I hate, I hate French pronunciation so much. You know why I hate French pronunciation? I hate them because if you mispronounce something in Spanish, that sounds fine. You're supposed to say taco. You say taco. Well, it's kind of stupid sounding whatever, but in French, if you mispronounce anything, you sound so stuck up. You really went for it. You were like, oh, bok. Aww. Oh, I was trying to sound soft, fancy saying, blog it the way I'm supposed to say it. And then if you get it wrong, it's just like, oh man, you tried to be fancy and you messed up. I love France. I love French culture. I love their history and everything they've been able to accomplish. But man, the French language xes me. It exes me. Uh, so ROMs, I guess is how I'm supposed to pronounce it. Um, and so th this is the ancient city where Kings of France are always anointed. And so up to this point, the Dohan has not been able to be anointed in, in rums in the city. And so, In a way he's illegitimate. You know, it's like if you're American, you, you say that you've been elected president, but you're never able to go to the capitol and swear on the Bible the way you're supposed to. Um, the, the ceremony hasn't been completed. So for some people, this is a, a real point of contention that yet this can't be the legitimate king because he's never been to rums, he's never been anointed, he's never done the stuff you're supposed to do when you become king. So this is her plan. Go to the Dohan, lead his forces, relieve Orleans. Go to Rums. . So at first she tries to go to some local officials and they totally blow her off.

No. And uh, but then she goes kind of to the peasantry. She goes on a public campaign, starts telling people about her visions and these things that she's seeing and hearing, and so she starts to get a little more popular. Then she gets a meeting with the local Duke, again, who's kinda like a governor, the Duke of Lorraine. And so finally she gets referred and she's able to go see the Dohan and he and his court inspector listen to her, decide we're gonna check her out and see if she's legit. And to their surprise, everyone is very impressed by this girl. Her conduct is without fault. She seems to be very pious. She seems to be very polite. She seems to have her wits about her. She speaks lucidly. She has a real plan. She speaks very clearly and very eloquently about these visions she's had and what she's here to do. And she has this very strong conviction that, that she needs to do it. And so people are kind of taken aback by this woman, but, but still kind of, I mean, what are you supposed to do? A peasant girl just walked into your court. We're all impressed, but are we really gonna do this? Are we really gonna do what she says? Are we really gonna make war strategy based on the word of this girl? It's uh, it's kind of a testament to their desperation that they even consider it, and so they go to their court clergy to, to the priests of the realm and they say, how do we know if this girl's real or not? How do we know if she's really sent from God? And they think about it, they test her and they say, okay, we, we have some tests for her. The first is we need to test her spiritual integrity. So they ask her questions about her belief. Does she know the important prayers? Um, does she believe in the Catholic church? And they do this kind of mini inquisition and she passes with flying colors. They say, okay, we need to do a physical inspection. So they have some women physically inspector to make sure that she is a virgin. Doesn't sound like a good time, but she is.

And so they say, okay, we're gonna give this, this woman, the task of, of relieving the siege of Orleans. Well, no one else has been able to do it. We'll give her a go. Why not? And so now against all odds, this woman, Joan, is given a suit of armor. She's given a horse, she's given a sword, She also gives herself a nickname. She starts to call herself the maid. Now the maid is an interesting nickname cuz it essentially means the virgin. It doesn't actually mean virgin cuz Virgin means virgin. But the maid is a young woman of a certain age who is hit puberty. So she's an adult, but she's not yet married. so she's a virgin, but she's a virgin of a, of a certain age. Right. , the, the age that, that Joan is. But by calling herself the maid, She's definitely invoking the image, the idea of the Virgin Mary. She's making implicit connection and implicit comparison between herself and the virgin Mary. And so, , when people hear this, this is like this very prophetic, title. She, she, she's the maid. I mean, it's great branding if nothing else. She starts to dress like a man. She cuts her hair short like a man. So she will look more like a soldier. She comes up with her own, flag that says Jesus Mary on it, uh, and, and has a cross on it and other things, , to, to signify that she's on this holy mission. And the first thing she does is she sends a letter to the King of England. And this is what it says. It starts by saying, Jesus Mary, it's invoking their names cuz that's who she represents.

Um, and everyone in France, whether they side with the Armon yachts or whether they side with the burgundians is at the very least very intrigued by this. They wanna see what comes of it. So she goes to relieve the siege of Orleans, and she's paired with, uh, as a general the bastard of Orleans. So remember, this is the guy who. Um, is the younger brother of the Duke of Orleans. , so this is his hometown and, uh, since the Duke of Orleans is still imprisoned, he has sort of claimed to be the commander of this area. And they form a kind of funny relationship. The bastard of Orleans is, uh, commander's commander. , he's fought in battles all his life and so he's all about using strategy and being smart about how they attack. He's just had this sort of embarrassing defeat at the battle of the herrings. And Joan has one move in her play book and that move is attack head on and let God win the victory for us.

Let's attack and ambassador of Orleans saying, okay, well, um, what if we instead, you know, waited for some reinforcements and, uh, they have this kind of push pull. So at first they head to Orleans. And they bring all these supplies, the English aren't able to cut them off. So they march into the city, uh, with these supplies, and then the Bastard of Orleans leaves with all his men. He leaves, and Joan of Ark is, is left in Orleans with these supplies. And she's outraged. , they, they say they're gonna come back later, uh, with, with even more supplies and, and better supplies so that they can have better attack. And she's like, no, God has promised us we're gonna win. We should attack now. And so she's able to exert some pressure. The men come back in relatively short order.

And there are a number of different forts. And so the first thing they do is assault. , one of these kind of smaller fortified positions. And Joan is in her gleaming armor. She has her white banner. She doesn't actually carry her weapon into battle, and she doesn't actually fight. She never kills a person in her life, but she marches at the front and encourages her men on and says, go attack, attack, attack. God is with us. God will give us victory. And they win this first little victory. It's just one of these little mini forts around the city of Orleans, but it's the first French victory in a long time. And the people of Orleans have just watched this 16 year old peasant girl lead the French to their first victory in forever. And so there's this incredible enthusiasm, and there's enthusiasm in the men too. And so, uh, they start to get some momentum. So then they attack another one of these little forts and they're able to overtake it as well. And so now there is a big fort, uh, the, the kind of main English fortification and. , they have archers, they have lots of men. They have, you know, decently high walls. And so, you know, this one you can't just take head on. But, uh, Joan says, no, here we go, full on frontal attack on this sport. Let's go. And in this attack, uh, she's injured, she gets struck with an arrow between her neck and her shoulder, and she gets it treated. And she says, no, it's just a flesh wound. And so she goes right back up to the front lines and says, keep going, keep going. And this really excites the men to see Joan who just had an arrow in her shoulder, comes back and is cheering us on again. And so they push forward again and they take this big fort, and the next day all the English troops who are, are left kind of line up to see what'll happen.

She had relieved this threat and for the moment squashed the existential threat that the English had posed to Armen y France. To me, when I look at kind of what happens at the siege of Orleans, it shows the power of small victories. When you have a big. . So when you have a big vision, small victories can take on prophetic overtones. You know, I remember that when I started my podcast, I really believed, and I really believed that it could be one of the biggest podcasts in the world. I don't know why. I just believed in myself. I believed that it had the power to be this. And so when I saw myself go from 100 listeners to 200 listeners, that's nothing. That's a small victory. And yet when you have that big belief, all of a sudden it's like, look, it's happening. Right? The thing I said was gonna happen is happening. And so when you don't have that big vision, then a little victory's, just a little victory. It's a hundred listeners, who cares. But when you do have that big vision, it's like, hmm, we doubled the number of listeners that we, that we had in the first three months. And so I do think it's because Joan was telling everyone, we are going to completely eject the English from France. , we're gonna take the dohan to ROMs, we're gonna anoint him, uh, and we're gonna go to Paris. She had this big vision, and so when she starts winning these first little victories, she starts getting this momentum. People start getting behind her, and that's what's le letting her now have big victories. So now, after this victory at Orleans, now the arm yacht priest say, okay, well we tested her spiritual knowledge check. We tested her virginity check, and we gave her a mission, and she completed it. Guess what? This, this girl is really sent by God. Congrats. And, and so now she's having this magical effect.

People just wanna be around her. and one of the effects that this has, you know, so for example, I told you that there had been these internal fractures, these internal conflicts within the camp of the arm yachts. Well, there's this guy, uh, named the count of Al, and he had kind of been on the outs. And so, , they didn't want him marching with the army. He didn't really wanna march with everyone else cause they had, you know, they had this fractured relationship. , he hears about all this and he comes and joins up with everyone else and they're like, all right, you can come . We're, we're all in a line. We're all going in the same direction. We're all rowing in the same direction. We all know what we're doing. We can put aside our petty differences now. And so this momentum starts to build. they need to take a few cities on the way to ROMs that are stand between them and, and this this city that they're hoping to go to. And so on the first one, once again, they show up to the fortifications Jones says, guess what? Frontal assault, we're gonna take it right now. They go, once again, a stone is thrown at her, hits her in the head, knocks her out. She gets up a minute later and says, I'm good. And she shouts to her Men, keep going, and they keep going with the frontal assault. And once again, they take another city. So they keep going. They take a couple more cities, and then the English army finally catches up to them at a place called Patay. And so there's gonna be this battle, the English and the French lineup and the English are trying to do kind of the same thing that they did at Acor.

Some of them let out a call and it notifies the French to Joan of Arc: their position. So these, uh, French nights immediately charge these English archers who have to turn and run, uh, cuz they didn't have the element of surprise that they were hoping for. And this battle of patee, uh, turns into a route. The French are overwhelmingly victorious. They kill a bunch of English men and they suffer almost no casualties. And this is the first major kind of open field battle victory that the French have had in a long time. One of the burgundians, who's with the English, they, they were their allies. One of the burgundians, a knight says, quote, by the renowned of Joan the maid, the hearts of the English were greatly changed and weakened. And they saw, as it seemed to them, that fortune was turning her wheel harshly against them. So once again, there's this idea of momentum. There's this idea that the English had this just feeling of victory, that things were always going their way. And now for the first time, things are not going their way. Things are going the opposite way, as you said. I love that. I love that saying fortune was turning her wheel harshly against them. And she's providing consensus of leadership. Even though all the decisions aren't being made by Joan, in fact, most of the decisions are not being made by Joan. They're sort of mediated by her, right? She agrees on all of them. And the fact that Joan is behind whatever is decided gets everyone else on board and the discussion is over Once, once Joan is on board, she knows that she's not an experienced commander. She recognizes her limits a little bit, but at the same time, she's also always pushing these generals who are more experienced to say, guys, we always attack. We have the help of God on our side. And so we go forward and we straightforwardly are marching towards prompts to, to anoint this king And, and one example of how she does this kind of gets consensus is, you know, some after this victory, some people are saying, well, great, we already have the English on the run. Let's just go attack them. Well, let's go attack their headquarters and, uh, kick 'em out of France entirely. And she says, no. The important thing is that we're marching to rums. We.

Getting Charles the dohan to be anointed because that ' s how Joan of Arc: things are supposed. That's what God wants. You're supposed to be the anointed king. And, and then we're gonna kick the English outta France. And so everyone agrees with that. Everyone goes along with their plan as they get closer to ROMs. Some of the cities along the way start surrendering with very little pretext of opposition. , the last city before they get there is choice. And it is a pretty big city. And she writes them a fiery letter and says, you know, you, same thing, she kinda said, the King of England, better surrender. Now we have the true born king of France, yada yada ya. And Troy turns them down. Troy says, uh, no, we're not surrendering to you. And so the generals kind of decide, okay, well. We don't know. This is actually like a pretty big city and we don't know that we actually have the manpower to, to take it. And Joan says, stop being idiots. We're gonna keep doing what we've been doing. You guys still don't get it. God is on our side. We're going to assault choice. We're going to climb the walls and we're gonna win as God intends. And then we're going to ROMs and we're gonna crown Charles. This is what we've been doing the entire time and we're not gonna stop now. And so they prepare for this great assault and they don't even have to do it. When, uh, when the citizens of Troys see that the arm yucks are very serious about this, that they really are going to assault them. They say, okay, a little, little too rich for our blood. And they surrender after surrenders. They write to the city of ROMs and they say, Hey guys, we surrendered. We think you should probably do the same. And uh, and so the city of ROMs says, okay, fair deal. And so they also surrender. They open the gates and. The Armon yachts are able to enter the city. The environment is kinetic, as they might say, in military terms. They can't just hang around for forever, so they have to arrange this anointing ceremony, uh, relatively quickly.

He gets off and he is anointed by the archbishop. , and as he's anointed, who is standing right next to him, but Joan, Joan, lapel, Joan the maid joan, the, the messenger from God standing there in her armor, holding her white banner. It, it is just amazing. You know, this has been a peasant girl. A year ago, less than a year ago, she was just some girl from nowhere. And here she is standing next to the, the man who's being anointed, the King of France, and, and she's the one who's right there because it's her initiative that made this happen. The Archbishop says his prayers, he burns incense, and then he anos the dohan with holy oil. He touches his breasts, his shoulders, his. And then finally his head. And when he touches his head, everyone in the cathedral shouts Noel. Afterward, Joan Nes at the feet of Charles and says, noble king, God's will is done. And she begins to weep uncontrollably. she had done it. She had carried out her mission exactly as the voices had told her to, and it went exactly how she thought it would. Things have completely turned. Now, um, people are now looking for excuses to side with the Armon yachts if they can. They've got this amazing woman , the maid who, who looks like a messenger from God. He's been anointed, they've won a few battles. Uh, everyone wants to, to be on board. The Duke of Burgundy is even ambivalent for a number of reasons. There's some complications with the English and, and things are turning against him. And so he's starting to send out feelers of guys. Can we have some maybe peace treaties, uh, between us, maybe a little bit of ceasefire, we, we agree not to fight each other on, on our own lands. We'll only fight each other on the lands that are controlled by, by English, France, that kind of thing. So it's been four months. In four months, Charles has gone from, you know, ready to flee Bouris and go further south and basically abandoning France. And then four months later he's being anointed.

And they turn from the city of Rems where he has just been anointed and they Joan of Arc: start marching toward Paris. Now at this time, it seems to me that the voices sort of abandon Joan. They're no longer giving her as clear of instructions at this time. She starts describing it more as she's coming to them with questions and seeking their approval. She's kind of coming with her own plants. There isn't the same very clear mission that she had before. Before it was go to Orleans, relieve the siege, and then go and anoint the king. Now there's just more, the more nebulous kick the English out of France, but, but there's not exactly as clear of a picture of how to do this. So they go to Paris. The English forces and the Armon Yk forces have sort of a showdown, but no one wants to risk a big battle. So, , , the English kind of just go back north into Normandy and the French surround Paris now Joan has been able to lead all these frontal assaults and just by sheer force of will take all of these cities. But Paris is different. Paris is the most fortified city in western Europe. It has very strong walls, it has natural defenses. It's got this river, Much of the, of the key part of the city is an island in the middle of the sand river. , so it, it's very different environment. But Joan doesn't know different environments. She doesn't know different tactics. And so she says, uh, We're we're leading, uh, frontal assault. Again, the Dohan and all of his commanders think this is not a good idea. but she goes ahead with it anyway. So they come up to the walls and, uh, she's leading this attack. And as they come up to the, as they get right to the foot of the wall, she yells, surrender to us quickly in the name of Jesus for if you do not surrender before nightfall, we will come in there by force, whether you like it or not, and you'll all be put to death. And there's a long silence. And then someone yells, shall we? You bloody tart. And then a crossbo bolt comes flying through the air and rips through her thigh.

And they drag Joan away from the walls with this arrow through her thigh , and Joan of Arc: she's bleeding profusely. And even as she's bleeding and she's literally being carried away by her own men away from the walls, she's saying the entire time, no, no, no. Paris can be taken. You must assault. But no one listens to her and peop and they retreat from the walls of Paris. Uh, the Duke of Bedford soon returns to Paris with more troops. And so the, uh, the French, the Armon Ys, uh, returned to Borges to their capitol despite Jones complaints, and now it's, it's interesting. She has given the French, the Armon Ys new hope. She has completely turned the tide to the war. They were on their last breath. They, they really were about to, to be knocked out. And now things are back to even, but she has lost one battle, or not even lost a battle, but she has failed, , to take one city. And her spell is kind of broken for some reason after this. She's, uh, she's now a liability. , she's not undefeated. She's not undefeatable, she's not invincible anymore. And so the Armon Ys kind of have to decide what to do with her, and they decide, all right, we're gonna kind of. Put her in some sideshows, uh, send her to some unimportant places where she can't make any trouble and she can stop trying to boss us around and tell us what to do. So she goes and relieves a few SGEs and takes a few towns with her same tactics. And then there is a Armin y city that is being besieged by Burgundians. And she comes and does her normal thing. She says they're the burgundians, they're gonna take the city charge and they make a frontal assault. Unbeknownst to her, there were some hidden English forces that had been outta sight. And once they charge and are engaged with the burgundians, the English come from behind and begin to surround them and others retreat and try to escape this encircling movement by the English, but she does not retreat. She won't retreat. She says, keep pushing forward. We're gonna win anyway. And uh, eventually she's abandoned by almost everyone in her army.

And eventually she ' s pulled off her horse and she ' s captured now the Dohan and all the Armon yachts , they have the position that this woman was sent by Joan of Arc: God. But the reason she got captured by the English was she got a little too big for her britches. She stopped listening to good advice. She got too willful. She was trying to dictate to the man who had now been anointed the King of France to the Dohan. And that's why she was captured. She fell from God's grace because she was too headstrong. And so they kind of have hung her out to dry. They say, yeah, she was, she was sent by God, but she's not anymore. And so the Burgundians are actually the ones who capture her and they hand her over. They actually don't hand her over. They sell her to the English. They were always looking for a deal. And so she's captured by the English, and this is really, I think it must have been a crisis for, of faith for her. She, she can't believe that her plan is not going exactly how she thought it would. So she's moved a couple times from Castle to Castle to different prisons, and at one of these, she tries to jump out the window. She said she wasn't trying to kill herself, she was trying to escape, but she knew that there was a, a chance that she would die and didn't care. She would rather die than be imprisoned by the English any longer. But she doesn't escape. She just injures herself, probably breaks a leg. And so now she's put under more strict scrutiny and so the Burgundians and the English bring in a bunch of priests to conduct a trial to find out if she really was sent by God. And of course, if these priests are being brought in by the English and Burgundians, you might imagine that they have a, a certain viewpoint that they're bringing into the matter. And so this trial consists of of bringing Joan the maid into a, a courtroom for basically a full day every day for weeks and examining her and cross-examining her day after day, trying to trip her up, trying to catch her in contradictions. And their hope is that they will be able to lay out a case of why she is a false prophet and heretical. And why the anointing of of King Charles that she was able to accomplish is illegitimate because it was caused by this witch, this horrible woman.

But they don't want to burn her at the stake. Frankly, what they want is for her to renounce her visions and miracles and prophecies and say, I was wrong. Because then they can say to King Charles, look, even the person who got you anointed is saying it's not legitimate. Everyone knows you're not the real king, right? So they are both trying to trip her up, catch her in lies, prove that she's this horrible woman, but also convince her to renounce what she has been saying, renounce that she has seen visions renounce, that she has heard the voices of these saints. . So they conduct this long and very loyally cross-examination. They keep very detailed records. Uh, so you can read it, you can read everything that happened. And it's amazing actually because you can get this glimpse at the real Joan. And in fact, that's one of the things I love most about this. And there's this book, it's called Joan of Arc by herself and her witnesses. That brings in a lot of the testimony of Joan and also the testimony of, of people who knew her from her time in Domi and after. And it's a, it's a great book. , I recommend it. Thank you to my cousin Mackey who, uh, who gave it to me and, uh, kind of sent me on this journey as well of, of thinking and wanting to, to research and, and write about Jonah Ark. So, um, As you read these transcripts of these cross examinations and how Joan responds to them, she comes across as extremely intelligent, lucid, clever, defiant, and full of conviction, full of true belief in what she has seen and hurt. She seemed in control. Even though she's imprisoned, she's surrounded by all these men who are hostile to her, who are trying to get her killed. She'll often answer, I answer that elsewhere. You know, I'll ask her a question, I already told you that. Uh, spare me that and pass the question.

That should be quite enough for you. They ask her again and she says, you burdened me too much. So she's very much like it. It does frankly remind me of, um, of Jesus in front of pil. You know, she's not answering when she doesn't want to answer. She's very much in control of the situation, and she's full of conviction. Another time they ask her if the people of Dom Rammi where she's from, were Armon Ys or Burgundians, and she responded. I knew only of one Burgundian there, and I could have wished his head cut off, however, only if it pleased God, and so she had many funny and uh, and clever answers. She even challenged her accusers at one point she told the bishop who was questioning her. You say that you are my judge. Take care of what you do for in truth, I am sent by God and you put yourself in great danger. The fact that the trial went on for 16 days is both evidence of the thoroughness of the prosecution, that they wanted to make sure that they were laying out a solid case, but it's also evidence of the deafness of her answers that it took them so long to get the answers that they were looking for because she was, she was smart in the way that, that she was answering. She said that the voices, and again, these, these are the voices in her head of St. Catherine, St. Margaret, and St. Michael, that the voices she claimed told her to answer with boldness and that everything would be okay. But in the end, how could it be? Okay? This was not a court in any real sense. It wasn't objective. There was no question in their head of what the outcome might be. This court was convened specifically to convict her. The outcome was a foregone conclusion and convict her. They did. They convicted her of, well, let me just read from, from the pronouncement. It's quite the rap sheet quote. Let her be pronounced and declared. A. A soothsayer, diviner, false prophets, invoker and conjure of evil spirits. Superstitious.

Inciting wars, cruelly thirsting for human blood and encouraging its shedding, unholy, forsaking the decent and reserve of her sex, a heretic or at least a vehemently suspected of heresy. Wow. Again, that is quite the accusation. So they start off with 70 accusations in total, actually, and in the end they whit it down to 12 official accusations that they think that they sh can really get her on. And so the, the examination, the the questioning comes to an end and they read her these 12 accusations and they tell her if she's convicted that she'll be burned at the stake. And she says, quote, I will say nothing more to you about this. And if I saw the fire, I would say all that I am saying to now and would not act differently again. They don't want to burn her. Actually, the best case scenario is that she recants. And so the next day they bring her into court and they have torturers standing there with their implements. They've got their tongues and their blades and their scalpels and their knives, , they tell her, you know, we might torture you for your own good because if by doing that we can get you to recant, it might save your soul. And she says, quote, in truth, if you were to have me torn limb from limb and my soul separated from my body, I still won't tell you anything more. , and if I did tell you anything else about this afterwards, I would always say that you had made me say it by force. Her answer is so powerful that they put the implements away and decide not to torture her. , but they do decide that there's nothing that can be done with her. I guess we're just gonna have to burn her. And so the next day they take her out to the town square where there was a stake put in the ground surrounded by wood, and they take her to a scaffold, put her on top of it, and they read her her sentence.

She says that she wants the pope to hear her trial. If the pope himself says that she is schismatic, she's all these things, then she'll believe him. and the English. Say, sorry, girl. That's not gonna happen. You're not gonna have your trial heard by the Pope, but you can recant your testimony here. And now we, in fact, we've got the, the documentation all drawn up. All you have to do is sign here. She looks around and she's hoping, she's hoping for her promised salvation that the voices told her was coming, but it doesn't come. And finally she says, you know, I always just wanted to be a good Catholic girl, and, and I guess I'm willing to obey the church and her judges. And so she, she signs this letter and she's taken back to her prison cell. Her men's clothes are taken from her and she's given, um, some rough women's clothes. Her head is shaved and she's told that she's going to spend the rest of her life in prison praying for forgiveness for her many crimes. and that might have been how the story ended, but it's not because the next day when her guards come to see her, Joan is back in her men's clothes. And that had been one of the points of the prosecution. One of the things that made them so sure that she was evil was that she insisted on wearing men's clothes. And so they say, you know, why are you back in your men's clothes? One of the conditions of your forgiveness was that you would continue to wear women's clothes. And she has all these answers where she had been very lucid and, uh, and very clear before. Now she's, she's, Jumbled, she's confused. She says, men were looking at me and, and. I didn't like the way they were looking at me in women's clothes.

She says, the voices have told her that she had damned her soul to save her life. They said she should have spoken boldly on the platform and died if she had to. They were angry telling her that if she denied that God had sent her, she'd be damned because she truly had been sent by God and she knew it. And so she recants her retraction that she had signed only one day previously. And that's it. That's the final straw. and so they tell her It's over. Um, you're dead. There's no way to save your life. Now, you, you're going to be killed. But there is still one more opportunity to save your soul if you tell us the truth about all this. Um, before, before your death, we're gonna kill you this very day and she says she can't. Um, she, she can't deny that she has seen visions in heard voices and says whether they are good or evil spirits. They appeared to me. She was then taken again to the public square. She was tied to the pi. People could see her lips moving as she prayed, ceaselessly. In her last remaining moments, her last words were Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. And then the flames consumed her. And so, and did the remarkable life of Joan. Joan, the maid. She was 19 years old. Uh, next episode we will talk about what happened after all this with the war, uh, what her overall impact and legacy was, the attributes that made her great. But just briefly, before I end here, I want to explain what I think was going on here because it can seem very confusing. Um, cuz there's this question, how do you explain these visions and voices? How do you explain her behavior here at the end? How do you explain her unwillingness to deny all this stuff? I mean, you know, we live in a very cynical age and so I think obviously the default assumption is angels were not constantly appearing to her and telling her what to do.

{"text": "telling her what to do . So what was really happening , and it ' s interesting , I heard a podcast a few months ago . Um , it ' s called the Martyr Made Podcast , and there was an episode on auditory hallucinations . And these are Joan of Arc: people hearing voices. And, um, in this podcast, the Martyr Made Podcast, they went through this Princeton study, that was done on people who experienced auditory hallucinations, most of whom, but not all of whom are schizophrenic. And they talked about, , what some of the common symptoms were, what, what people experienced when they experienced these, these hallucinations, when they heard these voices. And as I listened to this podcast, every single thing that was common for these people is exactly what happened to Joan. So for almost all of them, it started in adolescence that they heard voices for the first time. The first time they heard the voices, they were surprised. They thought it was a literal voice from outside their body. , they heard them from different directions, but the majority of people heard the voices behind themselves as Joan did, , it usually started with only one voice, but over 80% of them eventually ended up hearing multiple voices, and three was a very common number. Now, we often associate this with schizophrenia. We often associate this with hostile or malevolent voices telling people to do horrible, evil things. Um, sometimes there, there are a couple cases of mass shooters who, who said that they heard voices and the voices told them to do it. Uh, but that's not always the case. There are many people who experience auditory hallucinations who are not schizophrenic. who, who are able to function and don't do evil things, and the voices don't tell them to do bad or evil things. And to me that seems to be the case here. This this is what we're looking at. And I am, um, a person of faith. I'm a religious man. Even more I would say I'm, I'm sort of, I don't know, uh, mystical is a weird word. Uh, I'm just very open to different people's experiences and very open to, there being more than what we understand with our limited human understanding. Science has progressed an, an astonishing amount in the time that humans have been on the earth. But the amount that we do not know outweighs the amount that we do know, an infinite amount.

See an experience like this where Joan is , I think obviously having auditory hallucinations , I don ' t count out the idea Joan of Arc: that it could be more than that as well. To me, it's not a binary, it's not either angels or hallucinations. I think it could be both or neither. Something else I, I, I don't know. But I do think that the experience of auditory hallucinations, um, explains exactly what Joan was going through, and that is a way to understand it. And whether they were hallucinations or angels or both, I strongly believe that Joan really did hear voices that she believed were external to herself, and she really had followed those voices to the best of her abilities for her entire life. and those voices had led her to accomplish some of the most remarkable things that a human has ever accomplished on this earth. And, um, those voices led her to her death. And may, maybe that was supposed to be what happened because she would live on as a martyr. And, her example continues to inspire to, to the current day. Joan of Arc lived 19 short years, but in that time, she achieved the impossible. Okay, that's it. Um, sorry guys. Sorry to end on a üìç downer, , but next time we'll be a little bit happier, I think, as we talk about her legacy. So, until next time, thank you for listening to How to Take Over the World. ‚Äç Part 2 Hello and welcome to How to Take Over the World. This is Ben Wilson. This is part two of The Life of Joan of Arc. If you haven't listened to part one, go back and do that. On today's episode, we're going to go through what happened. In the war after jones death what happened between the french and the english Then i'm going to talk a little bit about her legacy I'm gonna do a little bit of character analysis and talk about what made her great And then i'm going to do a little bit of end notes going here and there talking about Other theories for why she heard voices why she's called of arc if that wasn't her last name And more random thoughts that are floating around in my brain about Joan. So, let's get to it, but first, a word from our sponsors.

{"text": ", a word from our sponsors . Have you ever gone into a restaurant , and you thought , Nice , I only spent 25 on that meal , and then the bill comes back , and then you add in the drink , and the tax , and the Joan of Arc: appetizer, and you actually spent, like, 55. And you think, how did that happen? Well, guess what? It sucks when that happens at a restaurant. It sucks way worse when that happens when you're selling a house, because those are tens of thousands of dollars you're losing. And it's really, really painful. I just bought a house. And so I have experienced something like this firsthand in the very recent past. That's why you have to use clever. It's the smartest way to start your home sale. They have negotiated insider rates with over 19, 000 top realtors from all the major brands like Keller Williams, Compass and Remax. And when you're ready to sell your home, they'll help you compare top local realtors in your area and pay just 1. 5 percent to your listing agent. Half the typical fee. The average clever customer saves more than 9, 000. I wish I had an extra 9, 000. I'd buy a sauna to put in my backyard to go next to my cold plunge. Clever has tons of information on their website to help you navigate the selling process. So be smart. If you're selling your house, go to listwithclever. com and save yourself 10 grand. I know I will. Again, that is listwithclever. com or just check the link in the show notes. And by the way, when you do use Clever, let them know that I sent you. Okay, so after Joan's death. Things go poorly for the Armagnacs. They were always feckless in war for the most part, except for when she was leading them. And that trend continues after her death. Henry VI, the young king of England, marches into Paris, which is a big deal. And militarily, the Armagnacs suffer some setbacks. But the Armagnacs are kind of rescued by fate. So, when Joan was leading The, the Armagnacs, the Burgundians and the English had been pulled closer together because all of a sudden these, these Armagnacs are having military victories. They're being successful. They're a real threat. And so this alliance is drawn tighter between the Duke of Burgundy and the English. Well now with, with Joan gone and things kind of settling back into their regular pattern, the Burgundians and the English start to drift apart. And this is accelerated when Anne, who is the sister of the Duke of Burgundy and the wife of the Duke of Bedford. So this has", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/joan-of-arc", "title": "Joan of Arc", "chunk_index": 32, "publication_date": "2023-02-24", "total_chunks_in_doc": 44}}
{"text": "gone and things kind of settling back into their regular pattern , the Burgundians and the English start to drift apart . And this is accelerated when Anne , who is the sister of the Duke of Burgundy and the wife of the Duke of Bedford . So this has Joan of Arc: been, uh, this really important political marriage that had cemented the two sides together when she dies. And shortly thereafter, the Duke of Bedford dies. And so now the Burgundians say, you know what? Forget it. This isn't really working out with us. We're fighting with Armagnacs all the time. It's destroying our land. And they switched sides. And so now it truly is, instead of the English Burgundian alliance against the Armagnacs, with the Burgundians switching, it really is the English versus the French. Which you all have probably been waiting for, so I've stopped saying all these weird names and talking in terms that you can understand. So, you know, just a couple years after Joan dies, the Burgundians switch, now you have the English against the French. That doesn't mean that the English can't win. If they had had strong leadership. Uh, maybe they still could have defeated, you know, both Armagnacs together, all the French united, but they didn't have strong leadership. Henry VI, this boy king, was not like his father, was not a strong leader. Uh, he, he was very compliant. He basically said yes to whoever was in front of him. And so that means that English leadership is fractured between all these different advisors and Dukes and noblemen who are sort of trying to have their sway over this compliant King. And so you have non unified leadership on both sides now. And so, uh, Neither side is really progressing, but I guess inertia tends to favor the English being in control of England and the French being in control of France. So, eventually, all the English holdings in France are rolled back, including, in fact, The English holdings in Southern France in Gascony, which had not even been on the table, right? And so, ironically, uh, just a few years after Joan of Arc's death, she got her wish. Her vision was completed. The English were completely ejected from France. And I think it's important to note that that is her doing. You know, it can be tempting to see her as a pawn, right? As the symbol used by the Armagnacs to, to come back and, and anoint their King and then used as a symbol by the English of, you know, the horrible heresy and the backwardness of, of the Armagnacs.

{"text": "and anoint their King and then used as a symbol by the English of , you know , the horrible heresy and the backwardness of , of the Armagnacs . And so she ' s burned at the stake , but it ' s not true that she was a Joan of Arc: pawn in someone else's game. She was a mover and a shaker. She was a player herself. She, Imposed her will on the world again. It didn't happen exactly how she thought it would, but the Armagnacs were on the verge of losing the English. If they took Orleans, that was it game over. And she's the one that relieved that siege. And it was her idea. Nothing was going on before she shows up. And then, yes, it's true that her siege on Paris doesn't work. And there's not this dramatic removal of the English from France, maybe the way that she thought or hoped. But what did happen is that the English threat was relieved and so the same familiar stable battle lines could be drawn which Allowed things to progress in a way that eventually saw the the English out of France That never even has the chance to happen if Joan of Arc doesn't show up if she never shows up then the English probably take Orleans and and then kick him out of Borges and Armagnacs are gone. Maybe control a rump state in southern France and And the English control France and who knows how the world would be different. So I think that's something that's important to remember is that, uh, Joan was a strong willed woman who, who was able to impose that will on the world after the French retake all France. Joan's mother writes to King Charles and says, Hey, could we retry Joan? Obviously this trial was rigged. Obviously it was a kangaroo court. There was never even a shadow impartiality and it would be great to clear her name. And so they do. They conduct a second trial, and this one is every bit as thorough as the first trial, but obviously each has a slant. So the first one is just trying to convict her of all these crimes of witchcraft and heresy. And the second trial, of course, is trying to exonerate her and show that she was actually a good woman. And it's really interesting. We know more about Joan than almost anyone else of the era because of this. Because we have these two different courts. We take two very different approaches and it's like we got light coming at her from both directions. And so we get this real clear picture of who she is. It's just fascinating that it's not a king, it's not a duke, it's not the pope, but like the person who", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/joan-of-arc", "title": "Joan of Arc", "chunk_index": 34, "publication_date": "2023-02-24", "total_chunks_in_doc": 44}}
{"text": "her from both directions . And so we get this real clear picture of who she is . It ' s just fascinating that it ' s not a king , it ' s not a duke , it ' s not the pope , but like the person who Joan of Arc: we have the most documentary evidence of. Who we know the most about their personality, their childhood, their, their whole life is Joan. And I think that's wonderful. She comes across as a very interesting figure. One of the things that you see about Joan, as you read some of the testimonies from the people that she grew up with, was that this was not someone who was ambitious. This was not someone that people expected. Would go on to accomplish great things and Joan herself, you know, said this, she said, although I would have rather remained spinning at my mother's side yet, I must go and I must do this thing for the Lord wills that I do so and everyone that knew her in Dome Remy kind of backed that up and said, yeah, I mean, she went to church, she spun, she worked hard. She was not someone who drew attention to herself. Until all of this happened, which to me, again, kind of bears out that this was something she really believed this was not someone who was opportunistic, who was seeking to get famous, uh, or seeking riches or something like that. No, this was. A very sincere believer. One of the other things that's interesting to me is in the second trial, they establish miracles, right? That attended her. And some of these miracles are what you would expect. So they're miraculous healings. The bastard of Orleans talks about. When they were lifting the siege at Orleans, they needed to row a boat across this river and the winds were against them. And so they're getting worried because, uh, man, we're, we're sitting ducks in these boats and we can't get across the river. And the English are going to start shooting arrows at us. And as soon as Joan shows up, the wind changes and it's able to help blow these boats across the river. Right? So, uh, you have these sort of miracles that you would expect, I think. And then there are miracles that I find. Uh, very interesting. Shall we say? So one is her chastity and her modesty were very important. So this is someone who, you know, you got to think about the times, right? When honestly womanhood. Was seen especially in these contexts in a military context was seen as you know weak and effeminate but also I think maybe a alien and so For example, one of the miracles is that", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/joan-of-arc", "title": "Joan of Arc", "chunk_index": 35, "publication_date": "2023-02-24", "total_chunks_in_doc": 44}}
{"text": "you got to think about the times , right ? When honestly womanhood . Was seen especially in these contexts in a military context was seen as you know weak and effeminate but also I think maybe a alien and so For example , one of the miracles is that Joan of Arc: people say That she didn't have periods, that she did not bleed every month. Now, actually this might be true. I think it probably is true. One, because of the physical hardship that she was enduring on these long marches and also because she ate very little and very rarely. And this is something I'll talk about later, but I think the conditions were there that it could be possible. She did not have, um, yeah, menstrual periods for, for long periods of time while she was on these campaigns. Other things that people mentioned was that she rarely had to pee. And again, this is another, this is a miracle because, you know, this is someone who's trying to maintain her modesty around all these men having to undress and go relieve yourself is going to be something that is, uh, difficult, uh, difficult to maintain your modesty while you're doing that. And so they said that her, uh, urinary continence was a miracle was, was unbelievable. You know, again, this is a funny miracle to me, but they considered it miraculous. Uh, other miracles that I find funny are a couple of people testified that, you know, she'd be changing and taking off her armor and oops, I accidentally saw her legs or I accidentally saw her breasts and they'd say that they were nice legs, but I did not. Feel any carnal desires. And this is evidence of a miracle. I mean, what kind of man would see these nice legs, uh, bare legs and, uh, and not feel carnal desires towards a woman. But, uh, but I didn't. And so this is, you know, this is a miracle, uh, more realistically, there are other people who, who said, you know, of course, when I first met her. I regarded her as a woman, as a potential object of desire, but that upon seeing her absolute conviction to God, that those thoughts kind of fled from them. And I thought that was interesting that It was her conviction, her absolute rock solid belief that is what made it possible for her to kind of overcome these base feelings and these prejudices that this is just a woman, something to be admired, something to be desired, but no, those ideas, those feelings kind of went out the window when they saw how strongly she believed in what she believed in.

And I think that ' s one of the things that ' s interesting Joan of Arc: about Joan. Is that she was sort of able to overcome her womanhood, her femininity, right? Like with this conviction, people saw past it. But at the same time, I don't think it's fair to say that she tried to be a man. I think she was able to use both. Masculine and feminine energy to her advantage. She intertwined the two. Yes. She physically dressed as a man for protection. Um, but she leaned into her traditionally female traits to help motivate the troops. She always referred to herself as La Pucelle. She referred to herself as the maid. And I think it was the fact that she was such a small, thin, young woman that made her such an effective leader. Yeah, she was making it clear that she was relying on her faith in God and not on her physical strength and arms. And so in one way, she's sort of able to, to inhabit masculine energy a little bit in that she's able to overcome prejudices of the day, but at the same time, she's such an effective leader because she leans into her feminine energy. It's what makes her seem kind of otherworldly and divine and sent by God. And, and I find that interesting. Okay. We're going to talk about. Uh, other theories for why she may have seen these visions and heard these voices after this quick break to hear a word from our sponsors. For anyone trying to accomplish great things, there is nothing more important than focus. There's a great story of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett meeting together and someone asks What was the most important attribute for your success? And they write down their answers and they have both written down the same word, focus. And for founders, one of the most common things that breaks people's focus is fundraising. You're worried about raising money and now you're not as focused as you should be on creating an insanely great product. And that's why I'm excited to partner with today's sponsor, Capitalie. They're on a mission to help founders raise money insanely fast. They have a network of investors, both angels and VCs, and a platform that connects founders to them easily and seamlessly. Some founders are able to start taking meetings in less than 24 hours and secure soft commitments for funding in less than 30 days.

Again, that is capital E. That's capital, and then the letter Y at the end. Capital E dot V C. Okay, so what are some other explanations that people have for why Joan may have seen these visions? One is ergot poisoning. So ergot is this tiny fungus that can infect wheat, and it has a mild psychedelic effect. So it's essentially, um, One second you're eating bread or drinking beer and the next second you're tripping and this did happen It definitely can happen. There's a real phenomenon. I think though when people propose this it's Oftentimes people who are really into psychedelics who try and see them in every historical event and so they'll tell you You know Jesus Mohammed Buddha All tripping on shrooms, the Greeks tripping on shrooms, Romans tripping on shrooms. Um, and, and there's very, very little evidence Joan had ergot poisoning. Um, for one, if she did, you know, she's eating the same bread, drinking the same beer, uh, as, as everyone around her, presumably. So how come everyone else wasn't having visions for another, you know, this could happen once in a localized place, but. This is someone who's traveling all around France, she's not taking her bread with her. So she just gets ergot poisoning everywhere she goes. Because again, she continues to have these visions and hear these voices throughout her life after adolescence. So I don't think that adds up at all, the ergot poisoning. Other explanations are that maybe she had a brain tumor that was causing Her to actually hear voices and fair enough. I mean, auditory hallucinations can be caused by brain tumors. If they impinge on a certain part of the brain, I also find that unlikely just because the onset of the voices was adolescence, which is very common for auditory, you know, normal auditory hallucinations that people have, it would be quite the coincidence. If she just happened to start getting a brain tumor at this time. When people who have auditory hallucinations generally start to experience those hallucinations for the first time. So, the idea that she had a brain tumor, again, you know,", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/joan-of-arc", "title": "Joan of Arc", "chunk_index": 38, "publication_date": "2023-02-24", "total_chunks_in_doc": 44}}
{"text": "the coincidence . If she just happened to start getting a brain tumor at this time . When people who have auditory hallucinations generally start to experience those hallucinations for the first time . So , the idea that she had a brain tumor , again , you know , Joan of Arc: it's certainly possible, but it seems very unlikely to me, very, very unlikely. Of course, there's another explanation that she just lied, that she was making this up. I don't find that likely for the reasons stated above. She's willing to die for it. So generally you're not willing to die for a lie and that it matched all the symptoms of auditory hallucinations. Um, everyone around her thought that she was sincere. Honestly, not even her enemies tried to paint her as a, uh, as a charlatan. Or as someone who was in it for the fame, even they recognized her obvious sincerity and said that it was more likely that she was, you know, her demons, they took for granted that she really was hearing these things. So I also find it very unlikely that she was making things up, which brings me to the last and my favorite explanation for why she might've been hearing these voices, which is that it could have been caused by delirium. from essentially, uh, anorexia. And why is this my favorite explanation? Well, not because I think it's true. I obviously, I don't think it's true at all. I already told you what I think is true, but because it points out something that I didn't bring up in episode one, which was that she was an extremely light. Eater, which of course is, you know, one of my hobby horses, but like even more than most people I've talked about, Joan was known as a light eater. So she was just peckish at the dinner table. She ate very little, but she was also fasting all the time. So this is a common thing in many religions. If you've heard of Ramadan, this is when Muslims. We'll fast from sunrise to sunset. So most of the middle of the day, they will not eat any food. And this is obviously not just Muslims. So, uh, Jesus was supposed to have fasted for 40 days. It was one of the miracles that he did. He didn't eat for 40 days. Uh, I think Moses did the same thing. And this is a practice in many religions that is supposed to bring you closer to God and help you have religious experiences, abstaining from food. So Joan ate very little, very light eater and, uh, and fasted very frequently, uh, to the point where some people read backwards and", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/joan-of-arc", "title": "Joan of Arc", "chunk_index": 39, "publication_date": "2023-02-24", "total_chunks_in_doc": 44}}

So Joan ate very little , very light eater and , uh , and fasted very frequently , uh , to the point where some people read backwards and Joan of Arc: think that she had some form of anorexia. Now, again, I don't think this is a good explanation at all for the voices that she heard because people don't talk about her as low energy. Or delirious in any other sense of her life on the contrary, she was described as, uh, as a very energetic person who always wanted to be moving and doing so, uh, you know, I doubt she was an anorexic and I doubt that she was experiencing these things because she was delirious, but I do Love that this theory Hits home the fact that she was such a light eater, which is of course a common attribute with with many many other great people A couple other things to address one is why is she called joan of arc? So she actually never called herself joan of arc. Um, the reason that people call her this She always called herself Joan LaPousselle, uh, she said she had no last name that she knew of. She was just Joan, which is, you know, typical peasant life at the time. Most peasants did not have last names. They're just, you know, Joan. In fact, in her local village, they called her Jeannette, which I think is like a diminutive. It's like a familiar version of the name. But so why Joan of Arc? Well, it's because, uh, after King Charles was anointed, he decided to ennoble Joan and her family. So, so now they are not just peasants, they are nobility and the title that they are given, um, is Arc. So they are now the, of Arc family. That was the. The title of nobility that they're given. So technically she was Joan of Arc. Now she wanted to emphasize her commitment to God and her special calling. She did not want to emphasize that she was now a noble woman. So she never called herself Joan of Arc. Uh, she called herself still Joan LaPucelle, but that is why she's known as Joan of Arc to all of us is because, uh, ever after her family was the of arc family who had this, uh, you know, this deed, this, this title is just a few other like little notes that I had. One is, uh, it's interesting. We know so much about Joan and we have the sort of objective descriptions of her.

{"text": "I had . One is , uh , it ' s interesting . We know so much about Joan and we have the sort of objective descriptions of her . Many mentioned her dark hair , very few mentioned whether they think she is beautiful or not . Um , Joan of Arc: and so it's surprising that in the 1400s, um, That there's so few of these accounts regard her physical appearances. I mean, that's something that is rarely granted to female figures in history, right? And yet Joan was able to sort of be seen for who she was and the qualities that she contained on, on the inside. Um, so I think that's interesting and part of that was the uniform. I think that's one of the reasons that she was so committed to wearing men's clothes and emphasizing her virginity is that she did not want to be sexualized. She wanted to be a symbol of something bigger and something more important. Okay. And then I'll just finish off talking a little bit about her legacy. So this second trial, uh, exonerates Joan sort of clears her name, but her status is sort of up in the air. Um, she's no longer an official heretic in, in the Catholic church, um, but neither is she an official hero either. You know, obviously the Pope just kind of wants to be politic. These are two Catholic powers that are warring, the English and the French, and he doesn't want to offend anyone. So whatever the Pope is kind of happy to not comment on this whole situation. But over the years, Joan becomes a symbol of, of French nationalism and also in many ways a symbol of French Catholicism. This is a woman who supposedly conducted miracles in the name of God. I think as far as the Catholic Church is concerned. It becomes a little easier for them to recognize her as a hero once the English become Protestant. So they're no longer a Catholic power. So the Catholic church is firmly aligned with France in any dispute or conflict between England and France. And so in finally in 1920, she's actually made a saint. She's canonized as a saint in the Catholic church. And now she is viewed as a, as a hero to Catholics. She's also viewed, of course, as a hero to the French. Uh, she's viewed as a very nationalistic figure. Interestingly, her legacy is sort of adopted by everyone.

{"text": "revolutionary , a socialist , whether you ' re a reactionary , all of them have tried to use the mantle of Joan to support their cause . Napoleon himself commissioned a statue of Joan that read , The illustrious Joan proved that there is no miracle which French genius Joan of Arc: cannot accomplish. When national independence is threatened. We will see if that is true. So there you have it in terms of my own personal takeaways. Um, one of the things that I took away is something I mentioned in Brigham young part two. Which was, uh, irrationality. You know, I, I thought Brigham Young made an irrational decision, but that's what made him a great leader. You have certain values that you have to be almost irrationally committed to. And you can see that with Joan, that she has this commitment to French independence, to victory in the war and to following through on this, this vision that she has. It reminds me of, uh, this is going to seem like a weird comparison, but. You know, her insistence that, no, we have to try and assault Paris. We have to try and take it against all the odds. Even when it seemed irrational, it seems foolhardy reminds me of the scene. If you listen to the Brigham Young episodes, uh, when the U S federal army is outside of Salt Lake city, and he is still insisting on the independence of, uh, of the Mormon people at the time. And I think this is often true, you know, um, Steve jobs was the ultimate irrational leader, right? And essentially to me, that irrationality is again, I'm just so committed to these values that. There are certain things that I will not compromise on. Even the rational thing is to compromise a little bit, just a little compromise. Who cares? Uh, another good example of this is the founder of Costco. So Costco is if you're not an American, this is a great big bulk buying discount buying. A store that we have here and they're known for their low, low, low prices. So you can find great, great deals at Costco. And this founder was committed to keeping great deals, keeping everything really cheap. And one of the things about Costco is that they have this food court and you can go to the food court and you get this amazing deal, which is you can get a hot dog and a drink for a buck 50, even now. Okay. So this founder comes up with this deal, you know, it's going to be. 1. 50 for a hot dog and a drink in 1985, 1985, think about how much inflation has happened since 1985.

The cost of meat is getting so Joan of Arc: expensive, they come around and they say, all right, we, we really need to raise the price of this hot dog. We're losing our shirts on it. We're losing money on hot dogs. And the CEO says, and this is a quote, quote, if you raise the effing hot dog, I will kill you. Figure it out. He later said, uh, I know it sounds crazy making a big deal about a hot dog, but we spend a lot of time on it. We're known for that hot dog. That's something you don't mess with. And so he has this like total irrational commitment to this certain price point. And you can see the same thing in Steve Jobs when he says, okay, you know, the machine, the actual box for this Mac needs to have exactly 90 degree angles has to be perfect. Can't be a degree off. Okay. Like that's irrational. But he had this commitment to physical perfection in their machines. And this thing that seems irrational actually. Is what makes great leaders that they have certain values that they just don't compromise on. And you can see that with joan She just had these amazing values that she never compromised on and that's one of the things that i'm going to take away Is I need to identify myself are what are those values that i'm never going to compromise on And and stick to those and that's what makes you a great leader.

Today we are talking about the guy Donald Trump . Maybe you ' ve heard Donald Trump: of him.Why would I do this episode about Donald Trump?Do I want everyone to hate me?No.The reason I wanted to do this episode is he is unquestionably a great man, one of the greats. 34 And that's not an endorsement, Neither is a condemnation.It's not a value judgement at all.He just is one of the great men of our lifetime, certainly one of the most powerful.His life is fascinating.And he's a symbol of this new mantra going around that you can just do things.You can just run for president with no experience and start the largest and most powerful American political movement in 100 years. 55 And let me just preface this episode by saying I know that many of you are not going to like it, both from the left and from the right.Donald Trump is probably the most polarizing figure of all time if you just take into account the sheer volume of people who have strong opinions about him.I would guess the upwards of 80% of the world, of the 8 billion people that live on this planet, either love or hate, have strong feelings in one way or another about Donald Trump in this episode, again, is not to tell you he's good. 22 It's not to tell you he's bad.I just want to get at the man Donald Trump, who he really is.What are the strategies that he has used to rise and become the most powerful man in the world?Because this is truly is a surprising and exceptional story.So let's get into it.This is the life of Donald Trump. 41 Before we get into it, I want to talk about a brand I'm obsessed with.It's called Van Man.This is deodorant from Van Man.Last time I talked about their honey and beef tallow bomb.This deodorant is amazing if you look at it, the first ingredient, coconut oil, right?And you, you go down. 56 It's all ingredients that you know and understand and feel safe and comfortable putting in your body.That's why I love famine.You know, coconut oil, arrowroot flour, magnesium, beeswax, Shea butter, grass feed, beef tallow, tapioca flour, OK, baking soda, it it's all real ingredients. 15 All right, if you go, I won't say what this is, but another kind of deodorant and ingredient #1 dipropylene glycol.All right, I just feel", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/donald-trump", "title": "Donald Trump", "chunk_index": 1, "publication_date": "2025-03-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 38}}

And so the federal government , the US government says it will give developers money to build new cheap housing for returning soldiers . 42 OK . But they put a cap on the amount of profit Donald Trump: that you can make on these complexes.And so Fred Trump cleverly just makes a shell corporation.And so 1 corporation is the developer and the other is the construction company, and he owns both. 01 And so he just transfers all the profits to the construction company, allowing himself to make all these profits that he's not supposed to be able to make.He does this by building more, you know, more cheaply than others while still maintaining a high standard of quality, but allows him to to pocket more profit than he was supposed to as mandated by law. 22 He actually gets called before Congress and he just explains how he did this.It's not uncontroversial, but it is legal.And so he he makes a ton of money doing this.During this time, he marries a recent Scottish immigrant, a woman named Mary Ann McLeod. 40 And together they have five children.Their first is a daughter, Mary Ann, then Fred Junior or Freddie as he was known, then Elizabeth, Donald, Donald Trump, the guy we know is the 4th and then fifth is Robert Trump.So who's this this Donald Trump kid? 56 Well, the first thing to know about him is that he loved fighting.He loved conflict.So here's what he writes about himself.He says even in elementary school, I was a very assertive, aggressive kid.In the second grade, I actually gave a teacher a black eye. 12 I punched my music teacher because I didn't think he knew anything about music, and I almost got expelled.I'm not proud of that, but it's clear evidence that even early on, I had a tendency to stand up and make my opinions known.OK.So yeah, he was a really aggressive kid. 28 There are other stories about him throwing cake at birthday parties, throwing erasers at teachers.His sister Marianne called him, quote, extremely rebellious as a youth.And yeah, so.So that's what he was like.He was very polarizing even as a child. 45 He was looked to kind of around the neighborhood as a leader, but also someone that a lot of people didn't like.He's a prankster.He loves pulling pranks and hijinks.And he has this combination that many great men always seem to emerge out of, which is he has a very demanding father. 05 You know, he he loves his father.He really respects him and his father loves him.They have a", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/donald-trump", "title": "Donald Trump", "chunk_index": 3, "publication_date": "2025-03-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 38}}

They have a Donald Trump: close relationship, but his you know, when Donald Trump describes him, he says, I love my father.In the very listen to this quote in Art of the Deal, Donald Trump says the most important influence on me growing up was my father, Fred Trump. 24 I learned a lot from him.Listen, I learned about toughness in a very tough business.I learned about motivating people and I learned about competence and efficiency.Get in, get it done, get it done right and get out.OK.So he, he really respects his father.He, he considers him his greatest influence. 40 But what's the first thing he says?He learned toughness.OK, that should tell you something about the type of relationship they had.And Donald Trump was tough and a fighter.And so he's the only child who would really stand up to his father.Not that he was abusive or anything like that, but he was very hard on the children. 59 And Donald Trump is the only one who doesn't say just, you know, yes, father and go along with it.He he pushes back a little bit.But so he's causing all this trouble.And at one point, Fred Trump finds out that Donald has been taking trains into Manhattan to buy switchblade knives. 17 And that's the last straw for Fred Trump.He says, OK, this kid, he's punching teachers, he's getting into fights, and now he's buying switchblades.We need to straighten this kid out.And so he sends him off to a military school called the New York Military Academy.And that's a good environment for Donald because it's it's a military school. 36 It's it's very aggressive.It goes well with his aggressive nature while also being very disciplined and helping to instill in him some of the discipline and rigidity that he would need to kind of even out his temperament. 54 Donald says about his time in New York Military Academy.I was a good enough student at the Academy, although I can't say I ever worked very hard.OK, so he's good enough.He's OK, but he didn't work very hard, so he didn't.He was an excellent student, and that's corroborated by all accounts by other students, by teachers. 11 They all say that he was a good student, but not a stellar 1.He was supposedly a", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/donald-trump", "title": "Donald Trump", "chunk_index": 4, "publication_date": "2025-03-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 38}}

He was supposedly a Donald Trump: very good baseball player and sports was very important to him.Again, very, very extremely competitive.Here's what one person said about him.This is someone who was both a teacher and a coach. 27 So he coached the baseball team that Donald Trump was on and also taught him.He says, I coached baseball and football and I taught them that winning wasn't everything.It was the only thing.Donald picked right up on this.He would tell his teammates, we're out here for a purpose to win.He always had to be #1 in everything. 43 He was a conniver even then, a real pain in the ass.He would do anything to win.OK, so that's what kind of person he is.He's also known as a ladies man.Women weren't allowed on campus at the New York Military Academy, But Donald Trump seems to find a way. 01 So he gets out of Military Academy in high school, after high school, after 12th grade, and the first thing he considers is a career in the movie industry.He briefly flirts with the idea of attending film school at USC.It's the best film school in the United States. 18 And he doesn't end up doing it, but he does end up obsessed with show business.It's really interesting to read through his biographies and he's always throwing out these little things that you can tell. 33 He's totally obsessed with this.He'll be saying, you know, 1988 is the year that I built X&Y building.It's also the year that cats came out for the first time.Like he just, he doesn't have to mention that, but he can't help himself.There's also a great interview that I saw with Steve Bannon that's that's very funny, where they're talking about New York in the 80s and they're talking about crime. 56 Steve Bannon is trying to get across the idea of how bad crime was in the 80s.So he brings up New York in the 80s and Donald Trump says, you know, I, I remember, I think he brings up a certain year like 1987, and Donald Trump says, Oh yeah, 1987.That's the year that Andrew Lloyd Webber was living in one of my buildings and he invited me to the opening of Phantom of the Opera. 16 Can you believe that?I was at the first", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/donald-trump", "title": "Donald Trump", "chunk_index": 5, "publication_date": "2025-03-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 38}}

I was at the first Donald Trump: ever showing a Phantom of the Opera.And Bannon tries to steer the conversation multiple times back to how bad crime was and just can't help himself.He's like, no, no, no, wait, hold on.But I was, I was there.Can you imagine that first ever showing Phantom of the Opera, one of the great musicals? 34 And he's, he's truly obsessive about musicals.And I think that gets at his love for show business and showing off and, and flair and, and being a personality and, and being in front of a, a crowd in his love of public adulation. 53But ultimately he decides not to go into build business.And he does go to school 1st at Fordham University in the Bronx, so they can be close to home, close to his family.But then he transfers to the University of Pennsylvania where he studies real estate.Penn is a very good school started by Benjamin Franklin. 10 It's Ivy League if you're not from the US Penn is not quite Harvard, Stanford, Princeton, Yale level, but it's just below that.And in fact, their Business School, which he attended is called the Wharton School of Business.And it's one of the best in the country.So it is in fact an elite university. 31 And apparently Donald Trump does well there.This is the 60s.And so there are a lot of protests going on and it it's the age of hippies and free love.And Donald Trump has none of that.He's not interested in partying at all. 48 He he just goes to school.He studies pretty hard, does quite well and then comes home, reads a little bit, watches TV shows and and goes to bed and then starts the whole thing over again.One reason that he goes to college, he was considering not going to college. 06 He was considering going straight to work for his father, But one of the reasons he does end up going to college is to avoid the Vietnam War.He never apologizes for avoiding the Vietnam War.If you were going to college, you'd get a deferment so that you wouldn't be entered into the draft. 24 So he never goes into the draft.And then once he's out of college, he had, he goes to a Doctor Who declares him medically unfit because of bone spurs.OK, this is a thing that you often hear from people who were dodging the", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/donald-trump", "title": "Donald Trump", "chunk_index": 6, "publication_date": "2025-03-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 38}}

So it's really well positioned.It's this old hotel, the Commodore Hotel with this long story history.It's a old famous luxury hotel in New York City. 02 But the neighborhood, along with a lot of Manhattan had started to get rundown.There's a lot more crime that was surging in the 70s especially.And so, and the Commodore was an old hotel.And so it, yeah, it was starting to get rundown.And the old owners of the hotel, we're not able to keep it profitable. 21 And it was looking worse and worse to the point where they had a flea market that was regularly operating out of the out of the main lobby of the hotel.And so Donald Trump comes along and says, hey, would you be interested in selling this and, and US redeveloping it? 42 And they say absolutely.Now Donald Trump goes to the city and says, hey, we need a major tax concession if we're going to do this.Because what we're trying to do is make a statement that, you know, Midtown is not going away, even though it looks like some things are going downhill and they're surging crime. 05 This new hotel is going to be a statement that no, no, no, this area is turning around.So this is going to be good for the city.And so can you give me a tax abatement essentially, you know, not charge taxes on on the hotel for a certain number of years. 21 And he", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/donald-trump", "title": "Donald Trump", "chunk_index": 11, "publication_date": "2025-03-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 38}}

I mean , it it , it ' s some of the most boilerplate scammy self help stuff that you can imagine . 03 : 40 Donald Trump: It's not a good book.OK, probably the most egregious money grab from this time is Trump University, which is a program to teach you about getting rich through real estate.And look, maybe some people learn something, but it is, I mean, it's hard to see it as much more than a scam organization. 03:59 You show up to a paid session and they say, hey, in order to really learn the tricks of the trade, you need to come to another even more extensive session.And there just isn't much value there.A lot of people are taking advantage of for a lot of money.There ends up being a class action lawsuit, which I believe is settled, but he has to pay out some money. 04:17 So anyway, it's unclear how much Trump is personally involved in things like this.Probably not much.He's not the kind of guy who would personally stand up a scam like this.But I think he's in desperate financial straits.He's willing to do anything to not go broke. 04:34 And so I think he's he, he must have known on some level that these were shady characters that he was partnering with and, and that he's getting money from.OK.He also starts going around and doing motivational speaking seminars with people like Tony Robbins, and he's making money on those as well. 04:57 To that end, in the year 2000, he flirts with running for president against Al Gore and George W Bush.And here's what he says about it.Quote, in 2000, I thought about running for president of the United States as a third party candidate.I proposed some sensible ideas. 05:12 Tax cuts for the middle class, tougher trade deals, a ban on unregulated soft money in campaigns, comprehensive health care reform.I formed an exploratory committee and met with Reform Party leaders.But in the end, I realized I was enjoying my business too much to run for off OK, so in the book, never enough. 05:29 Those authors take a very dim view of this first flirtation with a presidential run.Basically, they suggest that he did it in order to draw attention to himself and get more people to come to his seminars and make a little money off it.He's the only person I know of who actually makes money running for president rather than spending money to run for president. 05:51", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/donald-trump", "title": "Donald Trump", "chunk_index": 28, "publication_date": "2025-03-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 38}}

He once told me I won ' t make a deal just to make a profit . 12 : 33 It has to have its own excitement , its own Donald Trump: flair.Another Manhattan developer said it differently.Trump won't do a deal unless there's something extra, a kind of moral larceny in it.He's not satisfied with a profit.He has to make something more.Otherwise, there's no thrill.OK, I think this explains so much of Trump, this sort of romantic, almost artistic attachment to deals. 12:58 He loves to make deals.I think that's what explains his success and his failures.Real estate is a deal based business.When you're building housing, apartments, condos, hotels, you succeed or fail based on the structure of the deal. 13:20 Yes, good operations can definitely make a difference, especially on the margins, but the success of a building is won or lost based on the deal and the way it's structured from the beginning.However, casinos are the opposite. 13:38 Casinos are all about financial manipulation and excellent operations and making sure that you structure them on an ongoing operation basis to get you great returns. 13:56 And that is not where Trump excels at all.He's not a great operator.He's not a great executive.He is a great deal maker.And I think you can actually see this, you know, in the 90s, he acquires, well, he acquires Mar a Lago back in the 80s as a private residence. 14:13 And in the 90s, he turns it into a private club, into a resort in 1994.And this is when all of his casinos are falling apart and he's going bankrupt.And yet Mar a Lago does extremely well and does well up until the current day. 14:30 So it's not just that he lost focus.It's not really a shift in time of like, oh, he's good in the 70s and 80s, he's bad in the 90s and 2000s.No, it is he's good deals based businesses and he's bad at operations based businesses. 14:47 And frankly, I think you see that in his presidency as well.So you think about it, he's he's maybe not a great manager, not a great leader of the executive branch.So you think about his cabinet and he has three secretaries of defense, 2 secretaries of state, three different attorney generals, the list goes on. 15:07 Three different chiefs of staff.A lot of these people burn out.Like", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/donald-trump", "title": "Donald Trump", "chunk_index": 32, "publication_date": "2025-03-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 38}}

You have to to to make in Donald Trump: politics.You have to find those people that thrive on conflict and controversy.You know, what was the issue that made Trump a political figure? 17:51 I don't know if you guys remember this.What was the first thing before he ran for president in 2016?What was his first issue?It was birtherism.It was him calling into question Barack Obama's birth certificate and saying he thought that maybe he was born in Kenya.Now, obviously that is not a non controversial topic. 18:09 He was attracted to it because it was controversial, because it stirred things up, because he knew that it would get him in the headlines.So look, my prediction is as we think about celebrities who will succeed in the future, look for people who are already comfortable being controversial, who are comfortable with conflict. 18:31 So for example, I think if I had to identify someone who I think will be very successful if they decide to run for president, I think of the Paul brothers, OK, these are people who are incredibly controversial as TikTok stars and, and didn't just not only didn't mind it, but they leaned in to the controversy. 18:50 They liked it.And now they're literally fighters, They're boxers, They're really fighting people.These are clearly guys who are very comfortable with conflict and taking controversial opinions.So I think they would do well in politics.Whereas I think if you look at other creators, most of them aren't looking for the conflict in the same way. 19:12 So if you want to leverage a career in the public eye to get into politics, you have to be that type of person who's very comfortable fighting as Trump is.OK, what else?What else can we learn from Donald Trump? 19:28 He controls the narrative by throwing out red meat, he wrote.Quote.One thing I've learned about the press is that they're always hungry for a good story, and the more sensational the better.It's in the nature of the job, and I understand that.The point is that if you are a little different or a little outrageous, or if you do things that are bold or controversial, the press is going to write about you. 19:47 I've always done things a little differently.I don't mind controversy, and my deals tend to be somewhat ambitious.Also, I achieved a lot when I", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/donald-trump", "title": "Donald Trump", "chunk_index": 34, "publication_date": "2025-03-13", "total_chunks_in_doc": 38}}

It can make you sick, weak, irrational, irritable at the extremes. Stress can be debilitating. So I want you to imagine, put yourself in the place of someone who went through one of the most stressful situations that I can imagine. Her name was Empress Alexandra of the Russian Empire. She was born in Northwest Germany, and spoke fluent German and English, but fell in love with Prince Nicholas of the Russian Empire. She almost didn't marry him because she hated Russia so much, but she really, really loved him, and so she finally did agree to the marriage. But now, she spent all her time in a country where she spoke the language haltingly. Even after years of living there and where she never truly felt at home. She was also a naturally introverted and very private person. She had been born into minor nobility in Germany in what was a pretty obscure situation. But here she was like the ultimate celebrity. Her every move private and public was scrutinized for meaning and to ensure that it conformed to proper manners. And not only that, but she soon found that the Russian monarchy, that she had married into, was in terminal decline. And her husband did not have the strength of will, the strength of character, to maintain it. The only thing that she could contribute to the success of the monarchy was an heir. And she was failing at that, despite her best efforts. Four pregnancies had resulted in four girls. everyone wanted was a boy, an heir, who could be the next czar. When the fifth pregnancy did finally result in a beautiful baby boy, who she named Alexei, She was soon devastated to learn that he was a hemophiliac, a disease that stopped his blood from clotting and meant that he would be in constant danger of life threatening injury from even the most mild of physical exercise. Add to all of this the fact that there are revolutionary communist elements in Russia that want to see you and your husband dead. So you got constant negative stories about you in the press, very serious death threats against you, constant surveillance of your every move, and a son who you constantly have to monitor because his life is always in imminent danger.

Too rough , as it turns out . Your son begins to Rasputin: complain, and then his complaints turn into shouts of agony at every bump of the stagecoach. BY the end of the journey, little Alexei was nearly unconscious. For the next ten days, he screamed in pain, and moaned to his mother, Mama, help me. Won't you help me? It was so disturbing that the emperor, Tsar Nicholas, couldn't bear to watch and had to excuse himself from the room. Preparations were made for the little boy's death, and last rites were even administered to the boy, who was in such agony that this didn't even appear to bother him. When I am dead, Alexei asked his mother. It will not hurt anymore. Will it, Mama? As a last resort, Alexandra wrote to a spiritual advisor who she had met back in St. Petersburg, Grigory Rasputin. She asked him to pray for the boy. He was too far away to make the journey himself, but he telegrammed back immediately. Quote, God has seen your tears and heard your prayers. Do not be sad. The little boy will not die. Do not let the doctors torment him too much. Alexandra wrote after receiving the telegram, quote, I am not a bit anxious myself now. During the night, I received a telegram from Father Grigory, and he has reassured me completely. The next day, the internal bleeding stopped. Little Alexi would live, and the reputation of that spiritual advisor would rapidly grow. Soon, everyone in Russia would know the name Rasputin. üìç Hello, and welcome to How to Take Over the World. This is Ben Wilson. Today I've got an episode for you on Grigory Rasputin, the Russian mystic and advisor to the Tsar. And why do an episode on Rasputin? He's kind of known as a villain, PEople think of him as an evil, sinister, almost satanic figure when they think of Rasputin. And one reason to do this is just because, , he's very misunderstood. I think that the popular narrative about Rasputin is more different from the truth than almost anyone I've heard of. you know, as I was preparing this, I went and looked at some YouTube videos to see what other people had to say about Rasputin. And it's amazing to me that even people who make their living as history podcasters and, and history, uh, YouTubers say things that are just wildly untrue. That are rumors that have been thoroughly debunked by historians who have looked into it.

That are rumors that have been thoroughly debunked by historians who have looked into it . So I wanted to clear Rasputin: some of that up One of the other things I wanted to learn from him is persuasion. Is how it is that he was able to get this following if people thought that he was so sinister, uh, Peter Teal says that you should run your startup like a cult and that's something that Rasputin did. Uh, so I think there's something interesting about that of, of how do you get people to buy in? So deeply, so intensely that your following is almost cult like. I think it's also interesting, you know, Rasputin is someone who came from nowhere. You know, he was just a poor peasant from the middle of Siberia and he really punched way above his weight. He came to be one of the top advisors of the emperor of one of the biggest empires on earth, the Russian empire. , So I do think that there is a lot that we can learn from him. I also think it's a lesson in how to not do all these things because his story does not have a happy ending. Many people have heard of his death. It's one of the most iconic deaths of all time. So, . I actually was shocked at how much I learned from this story. I just thought that it would be interesting, but I really think that Rasputin is someone who, uh, yeah, it's not necessarily someone you want to emulate, but it's someone that you can learn a lot from this episode. , unlike most major episodes is for subscribers only because I wanted to do something.

{"text": "it ' s an interesting book . I wouldn ' t recommend it for most people . Because it ' s really , really in depth , it gets into like every minor detail of Rasputin ' s life . And I actually think it ' s a really good Rasputin: book. I'm glad it exists because Rasputin, more than anyone I have ever read about, has more myth, , around his life, more made up stories than anyone I've ever heard. Like, the popular conception of his life is just completely different from the truth. And so Douglas Smith is approaching it almost like a lawyer, kind of. He's going through each accusation. And he's diving into it to see what is true and what is not. And so that makes it really in depth. But if you're just a casual reader who wants to pick up a fun biography, it's not exactly that. It's a little too heavy to enjoy in that way. Um, but if you're really interested in Rasputin, and you really want to know everything about his life, then, , it is really well researched and really well done. One last thing is this one does need a little bit of a content warning. There's just a lot of talk about sex and a little bit of talk of violence as well. So if you're listening in the car with your kids, if they're little kids, this might not be the one. You might want to go back and listen to something else from the catalog. And one more warning. If you've listened to this podcast for a long time, you've heard me complain about French pronunciations. Well, French is a breeze compared to Russian. So, um, I, uh, I'm sure I got some of these pronunciations wrong, but, um, it is what it is\\ so with all that said, let's dive in. Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin was born in Pokrovsko, Siberia on January 21st, 1869. And Siberia where he grew up, you can think of as Russia's Wild East. It was very similar to America's Wild West, right? was very open, there was a lot of land to be had, so a lot of people moving out and starting life over, and so, you kind of have to... Um, start civilization from the ground up, that leads to a lot of conflict, a lot of violence, a lot of opportunity, and overall it was a wild place and a place where anything was possible. He was born to a pretty typical Siberian peasant family. His father had managed to acquire a dozen or so cows and almost 20 horses. And that's not extravagant wealth, but", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/rasputin", "title": "Rasputin", "chunk_index": 3, "publication_date": "2023-11-22", "total_chunks_in_doc": 11}}
{"text": "overall it was a wild place and a place where anything was possible . He was born to a pretty typical Siberian peasant family . His father had managed to acquire a dozen or so cows and almost 20 horses . And that ' s not extravagant wealth , but Rasputin: it was fairly prosperous by Siberian peasant standards Rasputin was the family name. And there's some words that are similar to Rasputin that have led people to suggest that this was not actually his last name, but it was an epithet. I meant to suggest that he was some kind of outcast or pervert. , and that is not true. There's no evidence for that. It actually was the family name, Rasputin. With a play on words, you can turn it into an insult, but his name was just Rasputin. We know almost nothing about his childhood. He would have learned to farm, to care for livestock, and to fish, but not to read. Rasputin was illiterate for the first 30 or so years of his life, which was normal. The literacy rate was only about 4 percent in Siberia at the time. We do know that he was a defiant and independent minded child. One of the few things that we know for sure about his childhood is that he was sentenced to two days in jail when he was 15 years old for adopting a rude attitude toward the district head of his area. He was also known for getting drunk and apparently committed a couple of small thefts. So, he was a little bit of a troublemaker, very independent minded. Now, I mentioned the rumor about his last name. Again, rumors. are kind of like one of the defining themes of Rasputin's life. Uh, there's a good quote from the book, uh, by Smith. He says, quote, To separate Rasputin from his mythology, I came to realize, was to completely misunderstand him. There is no Rasputin without all the stories about Rasputin. And so, there are all these stories. One is that he was a horse thief. And that he came from a long line of horse thieves and horse thievery back then was like really serious, right? It was like grand theft auto, , horses were very valuable. And so to be a horse thief. Was really looked down on. You go to prison for a long, long time. Um but if you look at the history, not true. , if he had been a horse thief, he would have been charged, you know, that would have been a big deal. And you can go look through the records and neither Rasputin nor any of his relatives, any of his close relatives, at least were horse thieves. There are other rumors, you know, that, . He was a rapist that everyone in the village knew", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/rasputin", "title": "Rasputin", "chunk_index": 4, "publication_date": "2023-11-22", "total_chunks_in_doc": 11}}

There are other rumors , you know , that , . He was a rapist that everyone in the village knew Rasputin: that he would try and seduce anyone that, uh, he had sex relations within his family, that there was incest and stuff like that. Again, as far as we can tell, none of this is true. Uh, people try and project backwards and give him this dark childhood. And, , it appears that he just had a normal, typical childhood admittedly. , yeah, he's a little bit of a troublemaker, but again, this is kind of the wild west, right? So a lot of people are, and it wasn't really out of the norm. In 1887 at age 18 Rasputin married Praskovia Dubrovina. , his wife, they would have a happy marriage, and she would be incredibly faithful to him in every sense of the word. They had seven children, three of whom survived to adulthood. They lived in Rasputin's father's house, which was a fairly typical setup for the time. And again, um, it was a, it was a pretty typical, you know, life for Rasputin when he was a young adult. Uh, here's what he had to say about it. Quote, When I first lived, before the age of twenty eight, as they say in the world, I lived in peace. That is, I loved the world and acted justly, and looked for consolation from the secular point of view. I often joined baggage trains. I worked a great deal as a coachman. I fished and plowed fields. All this is really good for a peasant. I had many sorrows, too. Whatever mistake was made somewhere, I was blamed, although I was not involved. Workmen from teams mocked me. I plowed hard and slept little, and I kept asking my heart how to find some way to be saved. I looked at priests as models, but it was not exactly what I wanted. So I started going on pilgrimages, and I was quick minded and observant. I was interested in everything good and bad. I had questions, but there was no one to ask what the answer was. I did a lot of traveling and searching and tried everything in life. So, as he says, he lived pretty normally until 28. He gives some of his complaints. Um, but at 28 he becomes a pilgrim. And this is kind of like a thing. In Russian society at the time, this is the end of the 19th century. And there were millions of pilgrims and they would go from place to place, usually to holy", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/rasputin", "title": "Rasputin", "chunk_index": 5, "publication_date": "2023-11-22", "total_chunks_in_doc": 11}}

And there were millions of pilgrims and they would go from place to place , usually to holy Rasputin: sites. And most of them were kind of unattached. They were vagrants. In fact, the state looked down on all these pilgrims. They didn't like having them around because as you can imagine, criminal elements could kind of hide in this pilgrim population. And, uh, and avoid the law that way. But Rasputin loved it. He loved seeing new places, learning new things. As he said, he had these questions. He wanted to learn more about the deeper things in life and didn't think that they could be answered in his village. So he just started wandering. And that was something that was atypical for him as a pilgrim. Again, there were many of these pilgrims, but most of them did not have a wife and kids back at home. They were mostly unattached people. So as he is a pilgrim, and going place to place, he has a miraculous experience that is a conversion experience for him. San Simeon appears to him and tells him, quote, Give all that up and become a new man and I will exalt you. Apparently this experience cured him of insomnia and bedwetting, which he suffered from well into adulthood. And at this time, he also gives up drinking, smoking, and eating meat. To complete the conversion experience, he has another experience with an icon of the Virgin Mary. He sleeps with it, you know, next to him. I guess he fell asleep praying. He has this icon of the Virgin Mary with him. And he wakes up in the morning and sees tears streaming down the icon's face. And he hears a voice, quote, I am weeping for the sins of mankind. Gregory go wander and cleanse the people of their sins. So he continues this pilgrim wandering lifestyle. Uh, they were called straniki, these wanderers, but he is remarkable as a straniki for a few reasons. Uh, one is when bandits robbed him, he would freely give them everything he had saying, it's not mine, it's God's. So he's very unattached to things and what little food he had. He would always share. He often went hungry because he would give his food to other wanderers, other Straniki. And so he's one of these Straniki, uh, but he's kind of a more intense, more spiritual one. And because people see him giving away all this stuff, uh, and living a little bit differently, uh, people start to come to him and ask him questions.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/rasputin", "title": "Rasputin", "chunk_index": 6, "publication_date": "2023-11-22", "total_chunks_in_doc": 11}}
{"text": ", uh , but he ' s kind of a more intense , more spiritual one . And because people see him giving away all this stuff , uh , and living a little bit differently , uh , people start to come to him and ask him questions . Rasputin: He has questions himself, and so he becomes a pupil of a man named Macari, Starets Macari. And it's with Macari that he begins to undertake serious study of the Bible. So, of course, first he has to learn to read, and he learns to read by studying the Bible, and he begins to become something of a Starets himself. So Starets means elder, And this is another thing that was common in Russia. All these starets, these kind of old sages that you could go to, to get wisdom from. So Rasputin is a little too young to be a starets in the true meaning of the word. But he does start to be considered something of a holy man. He's very good at reading people, to the point that people consider him, uh, like a, a mind reader. And he's very good at talking to people about God in a way that, um, gives them peace of mind and helps them feel good. His is a very earthy, humble gospel that emphasizes love, solid morals, and appreciation for the natural world. So at first, this is just kind of an informal thing. He's talking to people while he travels. And people really like talking to him and so word starts getting around and then when he's home, when he's not, you know, going on these pilgrimages, people begin to come to his little Siberian village to hear from him, ask him questions. He starts to get some acolytes, some disciples, people who hang around, come to stay with him and hang on his every word. And anytime you get followers, especially female followers, you get whispers and rumors. And so, , people in his village start to get a little bit uncomfortable with him. Uh, because he's got these women staying with him and these women are, you know, hanging on his every word. And so rumors start to go around that he's sleeping with all these women and he's essentially running a harem out of his house. At this point, probably nothing to these rumors whatsoever. So he's got these followers, uh, and after a while he decides to go on tour. He's kind of outgrown his little village, so he goes and visits a larger city called Kazan. At first to visit a wealthy widow who hears about him and is in need of spiritual counseling. But then he begins to meet with other people and he becomes something of a star.

But then he begins to meet with other people and he becomes something of a star . One account Rasputin: said, quote, My wife's despair grew into insanity and the doctors couldn't do a thing. Rasputin. Imagine this, after speaking with her for half an hour, she became totally serene. so he's becoming a star because of his ability to heal people, to read minds, to ask insightful questions, and for his spiritual counsel. But once again, people are accusing him of improper relations with his followers. And by the way, we'll get into this more later, but they were probably right to an extent. Rasputin was never the sexual monster that people made him out to be, but he liked to party, he had a weakness for women, and he was carrying on extramarital affairs with some of his followers, and he was always hitting on women. He's always, like, kind of seeing what he could get away with. And, uh, with his followers, he was very familiar with them. Um, not sexually, but he would kiss them and hold them and, um, act towards his female followers in ways that other people considered inappropriate in public. So there are these accusations starting to pop up. But at this point, he's still quite popular. And if Kazan was his warm up tour, he then decides to subsequently go to the big leagues and go to St. Petersburg. At the time, St. Petersburg was the seat of the Russian government, uh, kind of. It was where the Tsar resided. And whereas St. Petersburg is now Russia's second city, at the time, it rivaled Moscow as the heart of Russia. Once again, he takes the city by storm and, um, well, let's just read some accounts. I think it's interesting to see what it is that draws people in. There's one young priest who wrote, quote, Rasputin was a truly out of the ordinary person in terms of his sharp mind and his religious focus. You had to see him, the way he prayed in the cathedral. He stood just like a string under tension. His face turned to the heights, and then, with great speed, he would begin to cross himself and bow. I think it was precisely in the exceptional energy of his religiosity that lay the main reason for his influence on believers. Somehow, we have all become unleavened, or, to use the expression of our savior, the salt in us has lost its potency. We are no longer the salt of the earth and the light", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/rasputin", "title": "Rasputin", "chunk_index": 8, "publication_date": "2023-11-22", "total_chunks_in_doc": 11}}

We are no longer the salt of the earth and the light Rasputin: of the world. We have all cooled down, and then suddenly a burning torch appears. What sort of spirit he had, what sort of quality, we did not want to know, nor could we have discovered, for we lacked the necessary knowledge. But the magnificence of this new comet quite naturally attracted attention. So there you see, he's focusing on his focus, and on his deep, burning passion for his religiosity and his relationship with God. His daughter Maria would later say, quote, 20 years of pilgrimages and wanderings on foot. His peasant life, his love of the soil and solitude had developed in him that warm-hearted kindliness, that simplicity of bearing that bluntness of speech and at the same time, that rather overbearing independence, which marks the recluse. There has been talk of his lack of sophistication, his irresponsibility. And it is true where he was concerned with money, but at the same time, he showed in his dealings with men an extraordinary clairvoyance which enabled him forthwith to fathom their most secret impulses. A rugged bearing accustomed to speak his mind, never intimidated because he always plumbed the depths of men's thoughts. Such was my father. But the capital, sophisticated, worldly, cynical, did not greet a peasant kindly. of him turned a great many people off. Dirty, they called him, even though he was not. Slovenly, only because he did not style his hair and beard like the smart men of St. Petersburg. His refusal to kowtow to the rich and mighty was described as ill breeding. So there are a few things there. He combines the peasant simplicity and this burning sincerity of belief with a natural predisposition to understand people and these piercing eyes that everyone commented on. That was another thing. When you read accounts of him, when he first shows up in St. Petersburg, people can't stop talking about his eyes. One account says, quote, my attention was chiefly directed to his eyes. His gaze was always concentrated and direct. And a strange phosphorescent light played the entire time in his eyes. He continually stroked his listeners with his eyes. I noticed that it was precisely his persistent staring that had the greatest effect on those gathered and particularly on the women. So if you've listened, you've heard this before. There are other great people, who use this trick. But staring people in the eyes tends to capture their attention. And this really, really worked for him.

Uh , there ' s tons of quotes who talk about Rasputin: this. Uh, one says, quote, his eyes pierced you like needles. Another said, he had especially amazing eyes, gray that can, in an instant, burn red. His eyes are irresistible. They are filled with their own inner magnetism. When in the presence of women, they catch fire with an unusual passion. Another said, quote, there is something disturbing and alarming in the metallic expression of those cold gray eyes that pierce straight through you. And that's another common theme, is that people felt like, when they looked in his eyes, He saw into their souls like they couldn't keep any secrets from him. There's one experience a woman a Polish countess Meets him at a party and she shrieks and flees the party screaming quote. I can't I can't handle those eyes They see everything I can't take it Another woman found his gaze so penetrating that she felt, like, violated. And she ran to a church for confession after he did nothing more than just look at her. And I don't know if that's something that can be replicated. I think I mean, look at the pictures of him. He really does have captivating eyes. But I also think part of it is this way that he stared at people and that really captured their attention and drew them in and made them for whatever reason, want to disclose things to him.

Welcome to today's Napoleon the movie review, where it will be my misfortune to tell you about one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. I'll talk about some of the historical inaccuracies, what I thought was lacking about the movie, some of the things that I liked. There were not very many, but there were a few. And, uh, we'll get a little bit into Napoleon and what I thought animated him, and why I thought that this movie missed. The soul of who he was Before we get into it, a few announcements.

Okay, with that said, let's dive into this review of the movie Napoleon after this quick break. Okay, so as I alluded to, I thought that the Napoleon movie was... Pretty bad and it's a difficult movie to figure out. I mean you can tell that Ridley Scott does not like Napoleon But it's interesting because he doesn't even really engage with who Napoleon is You know, if you thought someone really really hated Napoleon, then they", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/napoleon-movie-review", "title": "Napoleon movie review", "chunk_index": 0, "publication_date": "2023-11-28", "total_chunks_in_doc": 14}}
{"text": "a difficult movie to figure out . I mean you can tell that Ridley Scott does not like Napoleon But it ' s interesting because he doesn ' t even really engage with who Napoleon is You know , if you thought someone really really hated Napoleon , then they Napoleon movie review: would want to expose the things that really were Shortcomings in his character, right? They would want to expose his egotism, uh, his restless drive, the fact that he was never satisfied, and instead, we get a character that is almost the opposite of who Napoleon really was. So, as portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix, Napoleon in this movie, Incredibly passive. He has no discernible intelligence or charisma, no ability to lead people. He doesn't really do anything for the entire movie. Like he's just an empty hole at the center of this movie, a complete non entity with no personality whatsoever. He almost comes across as like a early 19th century Forrest Gump, because you can't understand like why these amazing things are happening. If this person had no charisma. No intelligence, no ability to lead, no nothing, then it really doesn't make any sense how he is building this pan European empire, why he's winning all these battles. And so, Ridley Scott's unwillingness to show any redeeming qualities of Napoleon make it just sort of a head scratcher. You can't really understand why any of these things are happening. Uh, he just kind of stumbles along and, Oop, I guess we won that battle and, Uh, signed this treaty and, , I guess the only thing that he does that explains any of this, So for example, at the Battle of Austerlitz, Which in real life was Napoleon's kind of grand victory, And there's no way to get around it, that it was this incredible victory. The one thing that he does is portray the emperors of Austria and Russia as even more stupid than Napoleon. And so whenever he really can't get around a victory and something has to happen, uh, every single time he just portrays the enemies of Napoleon as completely inept. So in the first battle at Toulon, the British are off their rockers drunk. Uh, they're drinking, they're singing, they're completely not paying attention as the French just lay explosives all around them and easily overcome them and blow up their fleet. So Ridley Scott gets around his inability to say anything positive about Napoleon by making the British seem even stupider than him. Similarly, At the Battle of the Pyramids, , the opposing army is just a complete non entity. They just kind of line up and stand there, and the French fire cannons at the pyramids, , , and you're left to conclude that the Egyptians were just", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/napoleon-movie-review", "title": "Napoleon movie review", "chunk_index": 1, "publication_date": "2023-11-28", "total_chunks_in_doc": 14}}
{"text": "the Battle of the Pyramids , , the opposing army is just a complete non entity . They just kind of line up and stand there , and the French fire cannons at the pyramids , , , and you ' re left to conclude that the Egyptians were just Napoleon movie review: so overawed. By cannons, I guess, in the Ridley Scott world, the Egyptians didn't have cannons in the early 1800s. Uh, but they're so overawed by their superior firepower that I guess they just surrender. But he makes them seem very comical and stupid. And then you get to the Battle of Austerlitz and, uh, he makes the Russian and Austrian emperors seem very dumb. And then of course at the Battle of Waterloo, there isn't that problem, because Napoleon loses. And so he just gets to make him seem like an idiot again. And it doesn't just extend to Napoleon's military conquests, it also extends to what could have been the only interesting part of the movie. Which is his relationship with Josephine and there are a couple scenes that are okay, I guess. But the problem is they never build the relationship with any sort of warmth or understanding or love or even likability on Napoleon's part. And so when in later scenes, they try and create any feelings of longing, or missing, or love, or tenderness, or closeness, , it's just built on nothing. You have no idea why this woman, Josephine, would feel anything except for complete and total contempt for Napoleon, or borderline revulsion. So at the end they try and do this, this thing of like, Oh, look at these lovers who the world came between them. But it just doesn't make any sense because Napoleon is portrayed as a buffoon the entire time with no tenderness whatsoever. you have no idea why Josephine would feel anything for him. And it completely undermines any of the emotional impact of this plot line of the romance between Josephine and Napoleon. And so again, it gets to this mystery of like, okay, Ridley Scott. Why would you even make a movie about this person that you have so much contempt for? And also, do you even have contempt for him? Because it seems like you understand him not at all. Like this cinematic version of Napoleon bears zero resemblance to the historical figure. And what I'm left with is that who I do think Napoleon resembles is sort of the popular understanding Of like a Trump supporter of an incel and I think that's what this was really about Either on behalf of Ridley Scott or the writer that they have this this hatred towards Uh white men or republicans or incels or just kind of people that fall On the right wing spectrum of american politics white men in particular and so napoleon does come across as like", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/napoleon-movie-review", "title": "Napoleon movie review", "chunk_index": 2, "publication_date": "2023-11-28", "total_chunks_in_doc": 14}}

And I think this comes across most clearly when you Jen, who is the son of Josephine comes to see Napoleon to request his father's sword. And Napoleon is there with one of his subordinates and they're like playing a little game. I can't tell what they're doing. They're like throwing nuts into a fire. So this feeling that this guy has nothing going on, right? Uh, he's like this dunce who just Uh, plays around all day, dinks around, and It's completely the opposite of who Napoleon was. If he had a flaw, it was his restlessness, right? That he just couldn't stop. He couldn't be satisfied. He couldn't say I've conquered enough a time to make peace with England. No, he, he had to keep pushing harder and harder. But who it does resemble Is like a 22 year old, uh, loser kid in his basement playing video games. Like I got the feeling that's who they're trying to portray. And I mean, I guess that's fine. , if that's what they wanted to make the movie about, but it just makes no sense to make that. The Napoleon movie, and similarly, it doesn't even succeed on that level. Like if they were going to do that, they really should have done it. You know, a movie that similarly has a lot of contempt for men and has a lot to say about that is the Barbie movie and the Barbie movie, which I have not seen, but was at least a commercial and critical success. And I think in part that's because it was the creative vision of one person, Greta Gerwig, who had something to say, and of course you can take issue with what she had to say. Uh, again, I haven't seen it, so I can't comment on that. Clearly she had some critique of patriarchy and of white men that she wanted to get across, and some people resonated with that. This was like trying to be three different movies and none of them worked. It was trying to be like a big cinematic. biopic of Napoleon and the Napoleonic wars. It was also trying to be like an intimate love story between him and Josephine. And it was trying to be almost like a spoof, where it kind of critiqued, not really even Napoleon, but people who", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/napoleon-movie-review", "title": "Napoleon movie review", "chunk_index": 3, "publication_date": "2023-11-28", "total_chunks_in_doc": 14}}
{"text": ". biopic of Napoleon and the Napoleonic wars . It was also trying to be like an intimate love story between him and Josephine . And it was trying to be almost like a spoof , where it kind of critiqued , not really even Napoleon , but people who Napoleon movie review: are interested in Napoleon. Mainly young men, many of them white. Right. And, um, it doesn't do any of the three things. Well, it's not a good love story. It's not a good war movie. it doesn't have anything new or interesting to say. It's just sort of, I don't know, uh, a general gesture in that direction that it doesn't like a certain type of person. So, , maybe that would have helped the movie succeed if it had decided what it was trying to say or if it had tried to be one of those movies. I think on all three accounts, there are scenes that make you think, Oh, maybe this could have been good. So for example, the very last scene of the movie and obviously spoilers, if you haven't seen it, but the very last scene of the movie is him on St. Helena and he's just sitting there, uh, looking out and you hear the voice of Josephine and, uh, she says, you know, , come meet me and we'll try all this over again. Okay. And then it says that the last word that Napoleon ever said was Josephine. And it's an interesting idea. You can see if this movie really was just kind of a love story and all about that, and they had the courage to actually make these people fall in love, and you'd understood the attraction between them, then it would have been a beautiful last shot of, leaving you with this feeling of kind of ennui and wistfulness, that Napoleon is going to die, but maybe on the other side, he's going to see Josephine. Um, it's not this great reunion because everything was perfect about the relationship. It was this kind of broken relationship, but there was something intriguing and loving at the core of it. And so she wants to start over in the next life and see if they can really love each other this time and and figure out how to do this relationship in the right way. That's an interesting idea. Unfortunately, like, it's a punchline without a setup. Like, it's kind of a good last scene, but it's honestly a head scratcher because they haven't done anything to make that last line mean anything. You know, similarly with the war movie aspect, you look at the Battle of Austerlitz and, uh, they, they kind", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/napoleon-movie-review", "title": "Napoleon movie review", "chunk_index": 4, "publication_date": "2023-11-28", "total_chunks_in_doc": 14}}

You know , similarly with the war movie aspect , you look at the Battle of Austerlitz and , uh , they , they kind Napoleon movie review: of reduce the Battle of Austerlitz to this one sort of gimmick, , which is something that kind of really happened at the end of the battle, which is that as they were retreating, Uh, the Austrians retreat across some frozen ponds and, uh, Napoleon and his men who have just taken the Protsenheits, fire down on them with the cannons and break the ice and some men fall through the ice and into the water and drown. It's kind of a minor part of the battle that may or may not have really happened. Uh, it's kind of probably an exaggeration of something that did happen, but actually if you look at the historical evidence, probably only like a half dozen. people died that way. But anyways, they make the whole battle that. Which honestly, I could maybe forgive, because yeah, of course, throughout just one movie, you're not gonna have the opportunity to go into the intricacies of all of these great battles. And Napoleon has, you know, dozens of great battles that you could dive into in his lifetime. So I get it. Sometimes you need to reduce down the complexity of these battles. Okay. So, uh, the Austrians are fleeing over the ice. They're shooting at them with the cannons. There's one cavalryman who has the banner of Austria and a cannonball lands next to him and he falls through the ice and you see. the flag of Austria falling into this frozen water mixed with blood from this guy who's just fallen in. And it's a beautiful shot. And this is Ridley Scott, you know, this is the guy who did gladiator amongst other big epics, you know, this is a guy who did blackhawk down He did the martian. He did uh, the kingdom of heaven like this is someone who knows how to shoot a big epic battle sequence and uh, so so you do catch glimpses of that, but unfortunately like the stakes are never there You have no one to root for And so none of the battle, I mean, I found myself, I can't believe this, but during the battle of Waterloo, I was just like waiting for this thing to be over, which I am like the target market. It's hard to put up a battle sequence. That Ben Wilson is going to lose interest in. Um, but, but Ridley Scott managed it somehow in this movie.

{"text": "to put up a battle sequence . That Ben Wilson is going to lose interest in . Um , but , but Ridley Scott managed it somehow in this movie . And again , it ' s because you have no one to cheer for , , and also never Napoleon movie review: a clear understanding of the stakes is a function of another flaw with the movie, which is that it just moves from thing to thing to thing. I of course was never lost because I have read a good amount about Napoleon and so I kind of understand what everything was supposed to be representing. But I talked to a number of people who were very confused. About what was happening, because the pacing of the movie really is, uh, poorly done. And it just moves with very little connective tissue. And without a great explanation of why anything matters. I'm not sure that the filmmakers understood why anything mattered. And so when nothing matters, you have no stakes, and you have no drama. And, and that's kind of what happens. Now having said all that, I guess that's the laundry list of my complaints. Uh, there's more I can get into. There's more I will get into. But let's talk about some things that were redeeming about the movie. The, the few things that I did like. Uh, we'll get into that right after this quick break. Okay, so what did I like about the Napoleon movie? The first is the costuming. I know that's like a little thing, but the uniforms were spectacular. They looked great. They looked, uh, really realistic and they looked bright and beautiful, but also kind of lived in. I just really liked the clothing as well as the set design of a lot of it. I thought the coronation is unbelievable, the way they did Notre Dame, a lot of the interiors are really beautiful and really well done. I mean, this was like a first rate Hollywood production with everything that goes into that. And so it's really tragic for me to see that wasted, you know, probably never get a big budget Napoleon biopic in my life. I can't believe this was the one, but the costuming was really great and a lot of the effects were really good as well. In terms of scenes that I really liked, one that stands out is the very first scene. So it's the execution of Marie Antoinette. I really like that how they give her this haughty expression. You really get this feeling that she thinks that she is above all this, even as she is walking to the guillotine. I just think that that scene is pretty too. I like the way it's shot and it's very gruesome in a very visceral", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/napoleon-movie-review", "title": "Napoleon movie review", "chunk_index": 6, "publication_date": "2023-11-28", "total_chunks_in_doc": 14}}

I like the way it ' s shot and it ' s very gruesome in a very visceral Napoleon movie review: way, in a very realistic way. And I really like that. It really transported me to those executions, to the guillotine, to the French Revolution, to the feeling that must have been in the air. I thought that was really well done. Another thing that I really liked was the victim's ball. So, uh, supposedly there were these balls that were held in the 1790s for people who had either nearly escaped, uh, the guillotine, had had a brush with death, or had had someone close to them, , who was guillotined during the terror. And so they were these balls, uh, to sort of celebrate. the fact that these people were alive and celebrate their survival and kind of a new lease on life. And uh, I don't know a whole lot about these survivors balls. In fact, , as I just do a little Googling about them. It seems that the scholarship is mixed on like how widespread they were and whether they actually occurred, But you know, whether there were balls that were held specifically on those grounds, it does get to this feeling that was in France in the late 1790s, which was like. Wow. We, we came out on the other side of the terror. And so if you survived that, , there was this like frantic, frenetic energy, uh, to make up for lost time. So there was a lot of partying and there's just outpouring of energy and emotion often got displayed in romantic ways, you know, people coupling up, um, and so I just thought that they captured that energy really well in the Survivor's Ball, in that scene. You know, another thing that I'll say about the movie is, with the exception of Napoleon, the movie is really well acted. So I think Vanessa Kirby does a great job as Josephine. In fact, I'd say, unfortunately, that performance is a little bit wasted because it could have been. It was a great performance and, um, if, if there had been an understandable and relatable love interest and a spark between her and whoever they could have got to play Napoleon, you know, that could have been, I think, like a Academy Award winning or at least nominated performance from Vanessa Kirby. I thought she was great. I also thought that the actor who they got for Tallyrond, uh, was really good in the few scenes that he was in. Coulaincourt, uh, was also really well acted. You know, even,", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/napoleon-movie-review", "title": "Napoleon movie review", "chunk_index": 7, "publication_date": "2023-11-28", "total_chunks_in_doc": 14}}

Coulaincourt , uh , was also really well acted . You know , even , Napoleon movie review: um, Emperor Alexander, uh, of the Russian Empire, I think, , he's a good actor, and he does a good job of capturing who Alexander was a little bit, who was this young, smart, but maybe not as smart as he thought he was, emperor, who wanted to kind of go out and take the world by the balls, I thought he was a good actor. So, uh, a lot of good performances in the movie, other than Napoleon. And of course, Joaquin Phoenix is a great actor. I don't necessarily place the blame at his feet. I think the script was just completely broken. And I don't know that there's another actor who could have turned that script into a good Napoleon. So I don't place the blame for this horrible Napoleon at the feet of Joaquin Phoenix. I think it was the filmmakers. I think it was Ridley Scott. And I think it was the writer. Uh, David Scarpa, who, honestly, if you look through his IMDb, he's had a few clunkers. So it's not terribly surprising that he wrote a movie that was, um, that was not well written. Other scenes that I liked, the whiff of grape shot, uh, they don't call it that, but that's kind of what it's known as historically. That moment when the mob is marching on the Tuileries and Napoleon fires grapeshot, those little cannonballs at the crowd and they all disperse. The way that it creates this kind of wave of blood as these essentially shotgun, uh, cannonballs ripped through the crowd, I thought that was like accurate. And kind of cool to see, mean, cool, but horrifying to see, the effect that that would have on a crowd in that circumstance, I thought it was realistic and well done. One other random scene that made me laugh so hard is, uh, the guy when they're arresting the directory, which is the government before Napoleon becomes consul, one of three consuls, they're arresting a member of the directory. He gets outraged and says, I'm enjoying a succulent breakfast. I just thought that his use of the word succulent there is very funny and reminds me. Of a, of a video that you may have seen on YouTube of a man in Australia who's apparently like a serial dine and dasher. And he's being arrested and forced into a cop car. And he's saying,", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/napoleon-movie-review", "title": "Napoleon movie review", "chunk_index": 8, "publication_date": "2023-11-28", "total_chunks_in_doc": 14}}
{"text": "me . Of a , of a video that you may have seen on YouTube of a man in Australia who ' s apparently like a serial dine and dasher . And he ' s being arrested and forced into a cop car . And he ' s saying , Napoleon movie review: what is my crime? What is my crime? üìç . I actually wonder if that might have been the inspiration because it's so funny and so similar to, to that YouTube video. Uh, but that's a scene that randomly made me laugh. I am enjoying a succulent breakfast. Another line that is funny, probably unintentionally. So is when Napoleon says, you English think you are so great because you have boats, it's really random. I mean, , famously Napoleon, the remark that he receives on his final examination from military school says, this man would make an excellent sailor. And Napoleon, uh, you know, actually had a really great mathematical mind. , and so did have a very keen understanding of seamanship and of naval affairs. And so it is very random to have him , say that he has no, uh, understanding of, of naval affairs. Outside of like the English have boats. Um, but it is very funny. I don't know if it was meant to play as funny, but it was funny. And then again, the coronation, uh, is, is beautifully shot. It was really well done. They, they make this decision, which is to have Napoleon kind of snatch the crown and put it on his own head. And everyone acts kind of shocked. Oh, that he steals this crown. Of course, this is actually a moment that was very carefully choreographed between him and the Pope, uh, in advance. And so, instead of making it seem cool, they make it seem brutish. So the scene is shot beautifully, it looks good, but the way it's written doesn't make a lot of sense, and takes a lot of the emotion out of what could have been, like, a great moment. Like, one of the great moments of all of history. The definition of a self made man. And who's going to crown him? Well, he can't go to the old monarchy. He can't go to the Pope. , he can only go to the person who he derived his real authority from, which is himself and his conquests. And so out of necessity, he takes the crown from the Pope and places it on his own head.

In an age of reason and an age of liberalism , very cool moment . And , uh , Napoleon movie review: they just cheapen it and try and make him seem stupid and brutish. Uh, which drove me crazy. Another funny line, that actually like could have fit into the real character of Napoleon. Uh, if it had been handled more cleverly, it's him saying destiny has brought me this lamb chop. That was another moment that I actually liked. Okay. And to finish up, I'm going to just run down my list of notes and tell you every single thing. That I wrote down that either was historically inaccurate. Obviously I didn't write down every historical inaccuracy, but I wrote down a lot of the ones that bothered me and then everything that I didn't like. So this is just rapid fire complaints about Napoleon, a bad movie. So here you go. Toulon, why is no one in charge of this battle? Napoleon says like, go and then just attacks with everyone else. This is part of a larger trend of Napoleon just being allergic to leadership at all throughout this movie. He never leads. He always just speaks in an indoor voice and then things happen, which seems like the filmmaker is trying to disconnect him from the good decisions that he made or the good things that happen, uh, that he commands. So it's weird, like he doesn't seem in command. Of the battle of Toulon. They don't have him getting stabbed through the thigh, which is one of the sort of heroic moments of Napoleon's life. I actually can understand that because maybe they didn't want to have to take extra time to explain, you know, why he doesn't have a limp and show him recovering and recuperating and getting better. From this, uh, spear to the thigh, which he received. So instead they show his horse getting shot out from under him. Um, and I guess that's fine, but it is annoying that he just kind of waves his arm and people attack. They tried to portray Napoleon as just sort of the ultimate cuck. Uh, like he was literally cuckolded by his wife. She cheated on him, but, uh, they try and make him seem, bumbling, unattractive, and like he has nothing else going on and is just completely obsessed with his wife. And to that end, at their wedding, he is like hovering over her and trying to kiss her and she is trying to avoid his kisses.

When the truth is that he was hours late to his own wedding because he was so Napoleon movie review: deeply focused on his work that it just kind of escaped him. So I thought that was interesting that they missed that, that, uh, That he showed up late to his wedding. They have him shooting at the pyramids. Again, I suppose this is supposed to make him seem brutish. And like he has no respect for Egypt and for the history there. The reality is quite different. Which is that when they were in Egypt, French troops discover And Which is the stone that has a composition decree written in ancient Egyptian, as well as an ancient Greek. And of course, before the discovery of the Rosetta Stone, uh, no one could decipher ancient Egyptian. and when the French discovered it in Egypt, it was being used, uh, you know, wall as like a stone in a wall. And so anyway, the point is they try and show the French as like. Completely uncaring for the culture of Egypt when the truth is previous to the French coming the culture was completely uncared for and neglected and it was actually the French who Were able to find and preserve a lot of that Egyptian culture Uh, my other complaint is they try and make everything about Josephine. So they have him leave Egypt because of Josephine, and they also have him leave Elba because of Josephine. On both accounts, that is not true. Napoleon was not making large geopolitical decisions, uh, based on his relationship with his wife. And in fact, when Napoleon left Elba, uh, he already knew that she was dead. Uh, so he was definitely not leaving Elba in order to see her. another decision they make is to have Napoleon do his own reconnaissance. So you're like, we'll put on a common jacket and go out and observe things himself. Uh, and to me, this goes together with him kind of speaking an indoor voice. They don't want to show him being a leader or as actively leading anyone. And so, rather than. Like showing the operations of the French military machine. It's just kind of Napoleon doing everything himself So it's a weird decision to have him Doing his own reconnaissance and riding out on a horse and seeing what he can see at the divorce They have him slap Josephine To my knowledge, he never hit Josephine.

One of the things that ' s really used to sort of assassinate Napoleon ' s character in the movie . And Napoleon movie review: it certainly never happened after divorce. And I don't think he ever hit her. I mentioned that I liked a lot of the sets and a lot of the scenes. One of the exceptions is Moscow, which inexplicably looks nothing. Like Moscow, they have some domes in the background. So I guess it's like, okay, that's Russian. But, but like the color is very gray. And if you've ever been to Moscow, it's not, a very gray city, at least the old city isn't right. Of course, some of the apartment buildings that were built in Soviet times are very gray. Um, but like, uh, the Kremlin. And St. Basil's and like everything sort of around the center of the city is very colorful, is very gold and red and green. And, uh, they just have it like this very, um, gray, it reminds me more of. Maybe like a Berlin. , and I think it's all CG anyway, but if it's CG, then why did you make it gray? And it's very inappropriate. Doesn't, doesn't look like Moscow at all. Even on his return, Napoleon mutters, you know. I miss my home and I want to come back. And then the troops who are meeting him are the ones who shout long live the emperor and generate the excitement. And it's like, even in that moment, they won't let him be. Charismatic. Um, it's just a very weird moment. Like you have no understanding of like, why do these people want to follow him so bad if he's showing no charisma and no initiative, like his troops take the initiative to make him lead them. It's very weird. And then I guess I'll end on one of the only scenes that I thought was good him show some charisma, which is Napoleon talking to the midshipman. You know, these young boys in the captain's quarters of a British ship and you get to see them be charming for once. I think the point they're trying to make is that, , He's like completely glossing over everything that really happened and taking credit for things that he really shouldn't take credit for, and he's like indoctrinating a new generation of military idiots who will go out and create more chaos.

Napoleon is one of the most compelling characters in all of history, and they just completely missed on him. Just complete miss. They present almost an inverted picture of Napoleon. It's like the complete opposite of who he was. And so I would love it. Uh, you know, probably we're not going to get a 200 million dollar Napoleon movie again in the near future. But maybe someone could make like an animated movie about Napoleon that would be compelling. I don't know. I would love to see it happen. And um, honestly I think I could write a better movie than this. I don't think I'm a like, I've never written a film script before. But um, I do have trouble imagining I could do worse than this movie. So if you're a filmmaker and you want to make a good movie about Napoleon, I am scripting like a two hour plus very in depth episode about Napoleon that's coming out, uh, either next week or the week after. , that I think does a great job of capturing his character, hopefully.

{"text": "Brigham Young: Bear with me for two minutes. Let me make my case. I know you probably haven't heard of Brigham young. So let me tell you why you should care about this story about this episode. So, first of all, it's just a wild story. Let's start with the numbers. Brigham young, married 56 times. He had 57 children by 16 Born into abject poverty. He amassed a fortune of more than $15 million before his death. He did this by establishing not only a dozen business enterprises, but more than 200 cities, towns, and colonies, and even a couple of universities. He did this by leading 60,000 people. Most of them virtually penniless across the continental United States on foot and in wagons. He was a governor. Uh, founder and apostle, a leader, a businessman, a visionary, and a prophet. He has been called the American Moses. And I think it's an app description. He was a religious and secular leader who moved his people through a dangerous wilderness. And established a way of life in a new land. He was the second prophet or leader. I have the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints, frequently known as the Mormon church. He was an important religious leader with an interesting philosophical and religious perspective. But he's perhaps better known as a settler and a colonizer who built cities, churches, schools, canals, roads, and railroads. To me. I think the reason I'm drawn to Brigham young is this. When I was growing up, I loved SIM That was a computer game where you could design your own city complete with housing, business district, municipal, building sewers, roads, railroads, canals, theme parks, everything you could design every little aspect of a city. And as I talked to other people, especially men, I find that many of us had this exact same hobby of basically playing SIM city in our head. , and this is especially true. I think of like teenagers , and men who are just coming into adulthood. We like to draw up little utopias in our head that we'd like to think about the castles and the walls and the flags on the city layout, the roads, the houses, the laws, and the government. , like SIM city on steroids. We like to imagine these little utopias. And how we would organize things if we were in charge. Some of us even put pen to paper and drop little plants.

Some of us even put pen to paper and drop little plants . And I think one Brigham Young: of the reasons I'm drawn to the story of Brigham young is he's one of the very few people that I can think of who got to live this out in real He established a civilization from scratch. He helped determine all these little things, the roads, the churches, the industries, the homes, the religion, the flags, even the alphabet. But even if that doesn't sound appealing The magnitude and the audacity and even the weirdness of what he accomplished, I think is really interesting. It can help you think bigger and look at the world differently. . So even if the name Brigham young doesn't mean anything to Even if you've never heard of him either, if you're not interested in necessarily an 18 hundreds religious history of the United States or anything like that. I think this is gonna be an interesting story. So, um, yeah, give it a listen. Stick with it, at least a at least listened to part one and a, and let me know what you think. One more thing before we dive in, I have to lay all my cards on the table. And, uh, so I have to admit I'm a big fan of Brigham young. Not only do I belong to the church that he helped to found, but he's also my great, great, great grandpa. My brother's named Brigham. I very well might name a child. Brigham. I liked the guy. I feel incredibly connected to him. He established a lot of the things that shaped my life, including my family. I obviously have nevertheless tried to be unbiased about his strengths, weaknesses, and his shortcomings. As I have with everyone else I've covered on this podcast. but I do acknowledge that I'm not completely a neutral observer on this one. So, I don't think that impacts the episode too much, but, uh, it's probably worth disclosing. So with all that said, let's jump in, but first a word from our sponsors. Today's episode is brought to you by tiny capital. We talk a lot about building empires and leaving legacies on how to take over the world. And nothing is sadder to me than when a beautiful legacy goes to waste like Alexander, the Great's empire falling apart right after his death.

America had won its independence less than 20 years previously. And he really was a child of the revolution. What you might call the most American generation. His father had been a boy during the revolutionary war in both of his grandfathers had been soldiers in it. He was born in Whittingham Vermont, which if you know where Vermont is, , that is over kind of by the coast. It's over by Massachusetts , at the time Vermont was actually the American frontier. It's less than a hundred miles from Boston on the Atlantic coast, but that was America at the time. Almost the entire population was crowded on the very edge of the east coast. So especially in the north. That is where the frontier of America was. And so he was born on that frontier into a very poor family. , it was already a poor place, the frontier, but even considering the time and place the Youngs were particularly poor, like I said, his grandfather had fought in the revolutionary war. And he was a drinker and a gambler. His vices, impoverished his family and sent him to an early grave. And as a consequence, Brigham's father John. Was essentially a slave. I mean, that was a comparison to others made. He was rented out as a servant at age six. Okay. Six, six years old.

Six , six years old . He was sent Brigham Young: full-time to live with another family and tasked with running errands and performing odd jobs. And, uh, he was frequently beaten if he didn't perform them adequately. Despite his rough upbringing, John Young married very well. He married a smart girl from a well-to-do family named Nabby. How navvies father objected to the marriage because, well, he said, For he thought it rather beneath him that his daughter should choose a servant boy brought up in the kitchen with a black servants. But, uh, I guess John Young could be charming and persuasive. So he, manages to charm his way into a marriage that is probably above his station, despite her father's misgivings. But what he did not manage to do was give his children a much better upbringing than the one he had. The Youngs were still very Brigham would later say quote, in my youthful days, instead of going to school, I had to chop logs to sow, to plant and to plow in the midst of roots, barefooted. And if I had on a pair of pants that would cover I did pretty well. To add to this already difficult situation. Brigham's mother Nabby contracted tuberculosis when he was very young . And she was bedridden for most of his youth. His upbringing was also strict and religious. They read from the Bible frequently. His father was a disciplinarian and frequently hit his children though. Not necessarily more frequently than was common for the time. Brigham would later say, quote. I had not a chance to dance when I was young. And never heard the enchanting tones of the violin until I was 11 years of age. And even then, I thought I was on the highway to hell. If I suffered myself to linger and listen to it. So he's growing up, poor, working hard. Uh, with an absent mother. And then when he was 15 years old, Uh, so this is 1816, his mother finally succumbs to her long battle with tuberculosis , So at this time only the three youngest children are still living with their parents. So Brigham's older sister is sent off to live with family and he and his younger brother, Lorenzo Dow remain with their father. There is one memorable incident when Brigham's father had to leave for a few days to go to town, to do some business. So he leaves Brigham and Lorenzo home with what he thinks is enough food for a few days, but business keeps him longer than he thought. And the two boys", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/brigham-young", "title": "Brigham Young", "chunk_index": 3, "publication_date": "2022-09-09", "total_chunks_in_doc": 99}}

So he leaves Brigham and Lorenzo home with what he thinks is enough food for a few days , but business keeps him longer than he thought . And the two boys Brigham Young: run out So Brigham takes the family musket and goes out and shoots a Robin. And they boil it and eat it. And that's what he and Lorenzo had to eat for the last days before their dad came And that just gives you a flavor for the kind of poverty that he grew up in, but also sort of the rough frontier make, do figure things out, sort of nature of the environment that he grew up in. So then, , it's good that he's figuring out how to make his own way, because just a year later, when Brigham is 16 years old, his father remarries to a new younger woman. So now John Young has this new young wife he's kind of ready to restart his life with this woman. But it's a little awkward because he's got this teenager in the house. So he takes, bring them aside and tells him. You can have your time now go and provide for yourself. In other words, Get W what's going on here, man. You're 16 years old already. How come you haven't left the house yet? You're a deadbeat. Go, uh, go figure things out for yourself already. And so he does bring them Lee's home and goes even further west to Auburn, New York, which was a frontier BoomTown at the time and stays with an uncle and Auburn and starts to learn carpentry and furniture making over the coming years, he would also become a joiner, painter and Glazier. So he's a, he's a builder and a handyman. He can build almost And he was quite successful in these trades. He always had plenty of business. And even now, if you go You can find a lot of old homes where the owners will claim that their mantle was made by Brigham young. I think one of the impressive things about this time period in life is that he was an amateur tinkerer. He damned a river and built a mill, which turned to lave for one of his shops. And he came up with a very clever contraption for manufacturing paint. That used water power from this mill to raise and lower a Cannonball to crush the chalk needed to make a pigment to make paint. . So I think that's pretty cool. But what's interesting to me is that. Um, no one wrote about this. No one was talking about this inventor, Brigham young.

He was known as , uh , an inventor or anything . Brigham Young: And to me that says something about the enterprising and innovative nature of early America, that this sort of tinkering was commonplace. And so when you think about it that way, I guess it's not surprising that, , early America of this time period, we produce Eli Whitney and would produce Thomas Edison and all of these great, , inventors, because like that was the culture that they grew up in. Uh the kind of culture where you just. Make your own mill. And in that mill, you invent your own process for crushing chalk to make paint. . It was an amazing time for America. Uh, in terms of physical description, Brigham was short and barrel chested with an impressively, large head and a good amount of dusty reddish hair. In some early photographs of him, he gets a rather dashing figure, but most accounts describe him as neither handsome, nor He was hardworking, funny, charming, humble, and talented. But not noted for his intellect. Not surprisingly for someone who goes on to become a great religious leader, Brigham was naturally skeptical of organized religion. This was the time of the second great awakening in the United States, which was a great religious revival that occurred mostly in these frontier areas. And it was mostly the product of Methodist preachers. Uh, a number of Methodist sex came through teaching and having these great big outdoor camp meetings where you would have these famous preachers who would give these rollicking sermons. I've got one account here from 1799 from preacher in Kentucky named John McGee. He writes, Such a power came over me that I sat down on the floor of the pulpit, not knowing what I did. Of power that caused me to tremble was upon me. There was a solemn weeping all over at length. I rose up and told the people I was appointed to preach, but there was a greater than I preaching. I exhorted them to let the Lord God omnipotent reign in their hearts and to submit to him and their souls Many broke silence, a woman shouted tremendously. I left the pulpit to go to her. The power of God was strong upon me. I turned and losing sight of the fear of man. I went through the house, shouting and exhorting with all possible energy and ecstasy, and the floor was soon covered with the slain, their screams for mercy Pierce to the heavens and mercy came , from the same account.

Others overcome by involuntary hysteria and calling for relief . Many Brigham Young: prostrate with convulsive writings or standing upright and swaying their bodies and limbs to and fro in violent contortions. And this is just a taste, depending on the meeting. There could also be seeing there could be prophesying. There could be speaking in an unknown tongue where a person essentially shouts jibberish. I mean, these revivals were a party, say whatever you want about them, but they certainly were not boring. And why were these meetings like this? Well, you've got all these settlers out on the frontier, away from their old churches away from their families, their old communities. And this creates like a land grab for all these unclaimed souls. So you got all these churches competing for congregants. And one of the ways that they are competing is by having. The most entertaining meetings possible. And this must have been high entertainment. . I mean, if you are in Albany, New York or you're in Vermont and you're away from the theaters and the pubs and the bars and the sports and all the entertainment that you might have found in a big Eastern city, like Boston or New York. Then this is the best ticket in town. So Brigham and his family are going to these various camp revivals and Brigham is a very independent minded person. As I said, he goes to a lot of these camp meetings. And for a time he meets with different Methodists churches. But he jealously guards, his independence. He doesn't want to feel too closely tied to any one church or congregation. You get the feeling that it made him feel claustrophobic or like , like he didn't want to be committed to something that he didn't think he could fully follow through with, in another example of his stubborn independence, he demanded to be baptized by immersion by being dumped all the way under the water, which was not the practice for Methodists at But he read in the Bible that that was how Jesus did it. So he thought that was right and he wanted to do it that He's independent in other ways, too, he stays away from politics. He refuses to drink, but also refuses to sign a temperance pledge since he felt like it would bind him, uh, to not being able to drink anymore. He's an independent businessman who relies on his own skills and hard work to make his way. And he moves from city to city every few years. Never putting down too deep of roots in any single place.

They're drawn to him. But he's not really taking any leadership roles anywhere. Because he's got this like, , independent streak, , He kind of enjoys being on the fringes of society and, uh, not having ties or burdens or obligations. So, how does he go from this from someone who doesn't want to be tied down? Doesn't want to have these. , Ty's obligations to someone who is at. The social economic and religious life of a major world religion. Uh, with tens and eventually hundreds of thousands of followers. , well, it starts in 1824 when he's 23, he meets a woman by the name of Miriam Angelina works and they hit it off and get married. They have two daughters, Elizabeth and violet, and he settles into typical domestic life of a man on the American frontier in the 1820s. But it's during this time that he begins to hear rumblings of a new religious movement, they are being called the Mormons. Joseph Smith, the founder of this new religion. I was a man with a very similar background to Brigham young. He was from a poor frontier family that had moved from Vermont to upstate New York. He too had attended many camp revivals and like Brigham young had been inclined to associate with various Methodist churches, but without fully committing to any one of Then in 1820, when Joseph was only 14 years old, he claimed to have had a miraculous vision in which he saw God and Jesus Christ in subsequent years, he said he was visited by an angel named Moroni. Who led him to, , these golden plates and ancient record of the people who had inhabited America, hundreds of years previously, but they had been genocidally destroyed by a rival tribe. They had written their history and their religious teachings on these golden plates and buried them in the ground before they were all killed. By the power of Joseph Smith was led to find them. He translated them by the power of God. And the result was a religious book called the book of Mormon. And the book claim that these people hundreds of years ago, , had been practicing Christians had in fact, been visited by Jesus Christ. After his resurrection.

Of course , the religion was no longer around when Columbus and the other explorers arrived because , as , as I said earlier , uh , Brigham Young: they were genocidally, uh, destroyed by a rival So in all of these. , visions and apparitions and Rackless experiences just Smith, not only translated the book of Mormon, but he was called to be a new prophet. He was told by God that the original Christian Church established by Jesus had become corrupted that no Christian denomination any longer had the full truth of Christ teachings. But that all of those troops would be restored through him through Joseph Smith. . And he claimed to receive a number of revelations directly from God. After that these revelations settled matters of religious doctrine and gave practical instruction for this new church and how they should conduct their affairs. So, this is obviously a new, exciting, it's all happening again in upstate New York. Very close to where Brigham young lives. And it's creating a big stir. Some people are drawn to these exciting new teachings and join this church and others, of course dismiss it as a wild fabrication. One of Brigham Young's older brothers, Phineas is the first in the family to hear about it and he converts and then another older brother converts and his whole family starts to join the Mormon faith. But Brigham true to character is independent minded and doesn't want to join for a year. He's one of the most skeptical members of the family. And he really wants to investigate. Look around, figure out this church, figure out what they're really all about. So he's hearing about it. His whole family is joining. And he's not joining. And then finally, after more than a year, one day, he's having a discussion about Mormonism with his dad, his brother, Joseph, and his best friend, Heber Kimball, when suddenly, and I'll quote from an account here, he says the glory of God shown upon us and caused such great joy to spring up in our bosoms, that we were hardly able to contain ourselves. And we did shout aloud Hosanna to God and the lamb. So after this conversion experience, Brigham young was quickly baptized on April 9th, 1832 to officially become a member of the church. , the water was still nearly freezing in the river when he was baptized, but he was not the type of person to wait. Once he had made a decision, he liked to act quickly. And by the way, I just use the phrase, the church. , the official name of the church today is the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints. ,", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/brigham-young", "title": "Brigham Young", "chunk_index": 8, "publication_date": "2022-09-09", "total_chunks_in_doc": 99}}

So I won't go through all the iterations for now. And for most of this episode, I'll continue to use the informal terms, Mormon, Mormonism, and Mormon church. Uh, or sometimes as I did here, I'll just refer to as the church. , or sometimes I might refer to the, to the members of the church as saints, since that's the way they called themselves. . If you're wondering why I'm not using the language that. The church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints, currently requests people It's for that reason at this time, it was not called that. Anyway. So that's just terminology we'll refer to as Mormons Mormon church or the church and saints, all those things mean the same thing a month later, his wife, Miriam is also baptized and shortly thereafter contracts a disease that was all too familiar to tuberculosis. And so just as his mother had been bedridden, His wife now is as well. And with two young daughters, it is left to Brigham to take care of the girls. He wakes every day at the crack of Makes breakfast dresses, his daughters. Then picks up his wife, carries her and puts her in a chair by the fire for the day. Then goes out. , and does backbreaking labor as a carpenter. Then at the end of the day, comes back, cooks dinner, cleans, takes care of the girls, puts them to bed and then carries his wife back to bed. He's mom and dad for the sadly, and it must have been rudely hard work at the time. Um, but the situation only lasts for six months before his wife passes away on September 8th, 1832. And so this creates a sort of break in his life. Brigham young as 32 years old. He's been a fairly successful independent businessman, but not remarkably. So, nothing about his life would tell you that this was someone who was going to have an impact on history. For 32 years, Brigham lived a more or less normal. Frontier life. But from here on out. That was going to be different. And that's mainly because he would be fanatically committed to Mormonism. , he had already had a powerful conversion experience.

And it was very difficult to carry for his daughters without her. So he's got this kind of depressing life on the one hand. And on the other hand, he's got this one shining good thing, which is this new religion. So he decides to fully commit his life to Go all in, all in. Uh, in a way that most people wouldn't even have thought of. I mentioned earlier, his best friend Heber Kimball we'll bring them was very close with Heber and with his wife, violet. You notice. Brigham second daughter was named violet is after Hebrew's wife because he BR Brigham and his wife were very close with Hebrew and his wife. And so after Brigham's wife dies, he essentially hands his daughters off to Hebrew and violet and says, Can you raise these girls? I'm going to go off and preach the restored gospel. I'm going to go preach Mormonism. So he does, he completely abandoned his business. He leaves his daughters with his friends and he becomes an itinerant He went from town to town, asking around if anyone would house him and offer him food.

He isn't doing this for long before. He decides that he needs to meet the man whose religion has Sobey witched him. , so he, along with his brother, Joseph and his friend, Heber Kimball, traveled to Kirtland, Which is where the headquarters of the Mormon church was at the time to meet Joseph Smith.

And they do so they haul, uh, chop wood together. The first time that Brigham young meets Joseph Smith. , one of the things that brave young is impressed by is just how much would Joe Smith can chop. He is he's buff. Like he's, he's very strong and, uh, he can sure. Chop a lot of wood. And that's a interesting way to, uh, ascertain whether someone is a prophet, but Brigham kind of things, man, a guy who can shop that much, would he must be blessed by God. He's also impressed by his frankness and his straightforward manner. , he said, quote, when I saw Joseph Smith, he took heaven and brought it down to earth. That's a good description. He was a prophet having all these amazing visions, seeing God. But at the same time, he was a very practical person who wasn't afraid to chop wood on his own. Joseph was a boyish prophet. He was quick to joke and to laugh and he enjoyed games, especially ones where he could show off the strength like wrestling and stick pole. So after Brigham young meets Joseph Smith, if anything, he's more enthusiastic about his new found religion and continues to work as , and he's quite successful at this on his first circuit. He baptizes 14 converts and on his second circuit, he baptizes dozens. He was not at all educated. He basically couldn't spell for his entire life. And for that reason that he wasn't the best at offering great logical or reasoned theological defenses of Mormonism, but he was a very good people person. He was great at making relationships. He's also practical, quick-witted fiery folksy. , and he spoke with spiritual sincerity, which attracted a lot of people. After one of his preaching tours, Joseph Smith tells Brigham that he needs to move from New York and come live in Kirtland where the church has gathering place was. , you see the Mormon church, wasn't just a church, but it was supposed to be the kingdom of God and people didn't just convert, but they were also to help build up this physical community.

In Kirtland , Brigham young meets a young woman named Mary Ann Angele who really enjoys the style of Brigham Young: Brigham's preaching. Shall we say? And they quickly get married. Brigham's daughters come back to live with them and they quickly have a son of their own in 1834. In Kirtland, Brigham helps to build the city literally as well as figuratively. The saints in Kirtland are working on a large building that they call the Kirtland temple. Uh, and since they believe that they are the one true church restored by God himself, this is a big deal for them. This is the equivalent of Solomon's temple in Jerusalem. It's a great undertaking. Taking that great expense by people who did not have much. And Brigham young is integral in building that Kirtland temple because of the skills that he has. He's the primary Glazier who puts in all the windows and he helps with the carpentry, the painting, and other tasks in the construction. Of this wonderful new building and you can still see it today. Kirtland, Ohio is close to Cleveland and the Kirtland temple is still there. It's worth a visit. If you're in the area or at least go Google it to see what I'm talking about. In 1834, Kirtland, Ohio was a strong growing BoomTown. Where many saints were moving, but there was another gathering place for the church as well in Jackson county, Missouri. And it was not doing well at all. Joseph Smith had received a revelation from God that his new Jerusalem was supposed to be built. In Missouri in Jackson county, not in Kirtland, there's still, you know, working in and building Kirtland, building this temple, but apparently Kirtland was just supposed to be sort of an ancillary capital. Second city. The Chicago to Missouri's New York. So many saints are moving to Kirtland, but many are also moving to Jackson county. And in Jackson county. This is proving to be a big problem. The non-Mormon settlers are not happy about being replaced as the majority in the In particular, most of the non-Mormons we're from the south and favorite slavery. And most of the Mormons were from the north and So the native Missourians were afraid that they would be out voted on slavery and not just slavery, but other issues as well, more than anything, they were afraid that the Mormons would take over all the political life.

W which is , you know , honestly a valid concern , they would probably write . So that ' s Brigham Young: the consequences. Mormons in Missouri were being attacked and having their property destroyed and sometimes seized. They petitioned the state government of Missouri, but that comes to nothing. And so Joseph Smith organizes something called Zion's camp. And this is essentially a militia. It had 200 armed men from Kirtland organized to go to Missouri, defend the Mormons there and help them reclaim their property. Brigham young joined Zion's camp and it does not go particularly well from the jump that are arguments in the camp. The journey is grueling. The conditions were bad. If you've ever been to the Midwest in the summer, it gets really hot and muggy. The veterans Zions camp talked about having to strain their water through their teeth when they drank from rivers and streams, in order to filter out the mosquito eggs. So with those unsanitary conditions, when Zion camp makes it to Missouri, there's an outbreak of cholera and 14 people die. Also when they get to Missouri, they find that the non-Mormon Missourians are outraged by their presence. You can imagine how it might look to have a militia of Yankee religious zealots, armed with guns, marching into town. So Missourian start pouring in for miles around to form a counter militia. Soon Zion's camp is outnumbered, and so they decline to. They meet with the saints in Missouri. Tell them, sorry. There's nothing more we can do for you have some church meetings and then March back to Curtland with their tails between their legs. And this is a make or break moment for many of those who marched in Zion's camp. Many become disenchanted with Joseph Smith and leave the faith upon their return. But others become even more loyal to Joseph Smith after this. Sacrifice tends to solidify commitment and create buy-in. And so those that sacrifice a lot, if they don't become bitter are often the most committed followers. And this is certainly true of Brigham young. He viewed Zion's camp as an opportunity to learn from and grow closer to his hero. Joseph Smith, when he returned one person asked, well, what did you gain on this useless journey to Missouri with Joseph Smith? Brigham replied all we went for. I would not exchange the experience I gained in that expedition for all the wealth of Curtland. I watched everything that Joseph Smith did and the spirit he did it in and Brigham young wasn't alone in that those who went through Zion's camp and stayed loyal to Joseph Smith would serve as the backbone of", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/brigham-young", "title": "Brigham Young", "chunk_index": 13, "publication_date": "2022-09-09", "total_chunks_in_doc": 99}}
{"text": "for all the wealth of Curtland . I watched everything that Joseph Smith did and the spirit he did it in and Brigham young wasn ' t alone in that those who went through Zion ' s camp and stayed loyal to Joseph Smith would serve as the backbone of Brigham Young: the church for the next 60 years. So shortly thereafter, Joseph Smith forms the quorum of the 12 apostles. A quorum is just a group of people. And the 12 apostles is a reference to the time of Jesus. His inner circle was made of 12 of his closest friends and associates. And these 12 men were known as the 12 apostles. These were people you might have heard of like Peter James, John, Matthew, and Thomas. And the whole idea of the Mormon church was that it was supposed to be the same church that Jesus established it supposedly have been lost now is being brought back or restored. So to be put in the core of the 12 apostles is to be compared to people like St. Peter, and it's a huge compliment and a big deal. . So in 1836 at the age of 35, Brigham has made an apostle it's a big year for him. He oversees the finishing of the Curtland temple, um, and things are going well for him and for the church as a whole Curtland is booming. Economically. The saints are United spiritually. Any lingering conflicts from Zion's camp are forgotten and the church is quickly gaining new converts. There are now more than 2000 people living in cur. so in 1837, Brigham young and the other apostles left to the Eastern United States to go preach and get even more converts. That was the primary mission of the quorum of the 12 apostles preach. Get new converts. Brigham young is successful in the effort. One of the reasons why is that he's able to create these powerful, spiritual manifestations. Some people have this idea in their mind that Brigham young was a purely secular leader in the church that whereas Joseph Smith was this visionary spiritual leader. Brigham young was a purely organizational mind. And I think you'll see later why people think that. But it isn't true. Brigham was actually the person to introduce speaking in tongues to the latter day Saint movement. This is a thing where someone reaches such a heightened level of spiritual ecstasy that they start saying things that no one can understand. Uh, they're speaking gibberish basically. And this is something that is mentioned in the Bible and it was considered a strong, , spiritual experience. And it's something that impresses people in this era in the time of the second great awakening, , and people like it, people like that and expect that sort of thing from great preacher. so the fact that, , Brigham is someone who can do this, who", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/brigham-young", "title": "Brigham Young", "chunk_index": 14, "publication_date": "2022-09-09", "total_chunks_in_doc": 99}}

While Brigham is an apostle, the senior member of the apostles, the president of the group, the leader, his name is Thomas Marsh. And Brigham does not like Mr. Marsh. He considers him cantankerous, useless and prickly, and he was not alone in that assessment. There are lots of conflicts within the quorum of the 12 Aus. And conflicts between the apostles and Joseph Smith while Thomas Marsh is leading them. Some of these conflicts rub Brigham the wrong way. Uh, you know, Joseph Smith is having these run-ins with Thomas Marsh, but he's not taking it out on Thomas Marsh alone. He's taking it out on the other apostles. After one, particularly harsh talking to from Joseph Smith, Brigham wrote, we are apostles and it's an insult for us to be treated. But even when Joseph Smith was railing against him, Brigham young never said a bad word against him or against Thomas Marsh or against any of the other leaders that he had conflicts with. He kept his grievances private. He said, quote, how much fault have I found with Thomas B. Marsh, Joseph Smith or Sidney RMAN? I never opened my mouth. Even when they landed on me. A lot of this conflict comes from the fact that Joseph Smith is creating all these cool sounding offices and organizations without clearly delineating who is in charge of. You have the 12 apostles. You also have the high council, the first presidency, the presiding Bishop, Rick, the presiding patriarch, and the church is brand new. And they're trying to figure out what all these things mean and who is in charge of who. So there is some jockeying for power. So as 1835 was a great time for the church. , 1836. Turns into a really rough time. Joseph Smith and other leaders of the church had tried forming a bank called the Curtland safety society. And at first this seems like a great idea. It creates a flood of economic activity and Curtland is booming. Everyone is getting rich and happy, but then there is a national recession. It's actually more of like a depression. Uh, at the time, the word they used was a panic. And in this panic, the Curtland safety society fails. Uh, it basically collapses and everyone loses all their money.

This is at a time the United States did not really have a central currency . So you had to get , Brigham Young: different types of money from different banks. And so the Curtland safety society had been issuing their own notes, their own. And, uh, when the bank fails, it all basically becomes funny money. It might as well be monopoly money. It's not worth anything. And so this creates economic devastation and a lot of hurt feelings and a lot of conflict in the community when Brigham sees Joseph bank fails. So spectacularly, he has a moment of doubt, though not about his spiritual leadership. He says, quote, it was not about his revelations, but it was in relation to his finance. But he quickly decides quote, if I was to Harbor a thought in my heart that Joseph could be wrong in anything, I'd begin to lose confidence in him until it last, I would have the same lack of confidence in his being the mouthpiece of the almighty. So once again, Brigham chooses absolute loyalty to Joseph Smith, even though at times he's being berated by Joseph Smith. And even though he loses a lot of money in this financial crisis, he's still. And that's a lesson to me. If you decide to commit to something or someone be willing to be just absolutely insanely loyal, no matter what or don't commit, that was the Brigham young approach don't commit to almost anything. But when you do commit, be all in, understandably, most people do not take that attitude. And a lot of people leave the church at this time. They take their stuff and leave Curtland and abandon the faith. There is a lot of acrimony and a lot of divisions of the community at the time. One example is Brigham young get sued by a guy named Jacob bump. Brigham bought a property off him for $500 in Curtland safety society notes. And now those notes are worthless. So from BU's perspective, he's like, Hey, you swindled me. But from Brigham's perspective, it's like, well, what do you want me to do? People paid me in Kurtland safety society notes. Everyone has been paying everyone with these things. We can't just unwind all the economic activity of the last year. In fact bump had been one of the first people to buy and sell in Curtland notes.

In the end , Brigham young Joseph Smith Brigham Young: and other senior leadership of the church are forced to leave. Curtland in order to avoid creditors, apostates, and dissenters, who were increasingly angry , and making violent threats, there were immediate, incredible threats of violence. So they flee to the other gathering place of the saints in Missouri. Since Zion's camp, the Missouri saints had suffered even more persecution and violence from Missourian, but they had not been involved with the banking scheme in Curtland. And so there wasn't the same sort of anger towards the church and its senior leader. From the membership. So Missouri was a safe space for them in one way, in that they had loyal friends members of the church there, but it was obviously not a safe space in that the non-Mormons there were particularly hostile. So they've already lost the temple and most of what they struggled so hard to build in Curtland and things would only get worse in Missouri at the time, Joseph Smith's right hand, man was a guy named Sidney Rigdon and he preaches something called the salt sermon. He suggests that unfaithful members need to be purged out of the church. It's seen as very provocative, not only to wavering members, but also to non-members in the area who are always worried about violent reprisals, especially since Zion's camp in a follow up sermon, he says, quote, if that mob comes on us to disturb us, it shall be between us and them. A war of extermination for, we will follow them till the last drop of their blood is. okay. Whoops. , , it's not hard to see why non-Mormons in the area would find that very provocative, basically a declaration of war. And I think with more, more Mormons migrating to the area, Sydney Riggin had maybe overestimated their relative strength, but they were still nowhere near as numerous as their non-Mormon. And so unsurprisingly, this quickly turns from a war of words, into actual violence. There's a brawl, uh, and then Mormon reprisals as they burn some of the homes of suspected mobs. The Mormons are actually winning initially in this conflict, they're giving as good as they're getting at this point, but then there is a battle, the battle of crooked river it's between a Mormon militia and a non-Mormon militia.

But what it does is draw attention to the governor of Missouri Lilburn Brigham Young: bogs, governor bogs hears that there has been a battle in his state. And previously he had been somewhat favorably disposed towards the Mormons. He had at least wanted to keep a lid on things and had wanted to help where he could in mitigating attacks on Mormon settle. But when he hears that a battle happened in his state, he's now worried about this whole thing, spiraling out into an actual civil war. And so he wants the whole problem gone. Uh, so he issues a very famous executive order that is most commonly known as the extermination order or the Mormon extermination order in the most famous part of it. It reads, I have received information of the most appalling character, which entirely changes the face of things and places the Mormons in the attitude of an open and a vowed defiance of the laws. And of having made war upon the people of this state, the Mormons must be treated as enemies and must be exterminated or driven from the state if necessary for the public peace. All right. Well, it's usually not a good thing when your government declares that you and your people must be exterminated. So it becomes clear that, , the saints have to go are gonna have to find a new place again. , when it becomes clear, the saints are going to have to leave the mobs around them. Start to smell blood. They form up and begin to attack rape, kill steal, you name it. They burn houses, farms and fields. , the most famous incident is the massacre at Hans mill, where a settlement is attacked. And so a bunch of people retreat and take refuge in a mill and the non-Mormon mob come and put their guns through any cracks and holes in the mill and start blindly firing inside. They kill 17 people and decap it all off a 10 year old Mormon boy escapes and hides during the attack. And a member of the mob finds him and says, knits will make lice. If he had lived, he would've become a Mormon and puts his gun to the boy's head and blows it off. So, , you know, after, , these kinds of massacres, , there's no going back. There's no making peace.

But he makes a huge mistake. , he's afraid that if he sends trusted advisors like Brigham young, that they'll be kidnapped and held as bargaining chips. So he sends over defectors people who are known to not be loyal to him. Now, Joseph Smith was a master profit. Some of his religious insights are breath. Thinkingly beautiful and insightful, but some of his non-religious leadership decisions were baffling. Brigham young later said . Joseph Smith's policy and temporal things was different from my idea of the way to manage them. And coming from Brigham young, who adore Joseph Smith practically worshiped him. That's like a crushing indictment. Uh, in fact, I think it's probably the most negative thing I've ever seen him say about Joseph Smith. , but this is one of those incidents that really makes you question his non-religious leadership. Like what you thought it was a good idea to send known defectors. To negotiate for you in this high stakes conflict. Well, unsurprisingly, these representatives of Joe Smith, double cross him as he should have suspected they would do so they come back and say, oh yeah, the Missourians are totally willing to negotiate with you. , go see him tomorrow. So the top four primary leaders of the church go to negotiate with the Missouri army and are promptly arrested and hauled off to a jail in Liberty, Missouri, those four leaders are Joseph Smith, his brother Heru Smith, Sid Rigdon and Parley. with the leadership decapitated and the imbalance of forces. Now overwhelming the Mormon militia surrenders, and are disarmed the Missourians. Start running through Mormon settlements, taking all their stuff that's worth anything and burning all the rest general Clark who leads the Missouri militia tells the Mormons. I would advise you to scatter abroad and become as other citizens. In other words shows over here, folks abandon your religion. Stop trying to build this cool new city. It's over. It's. So things are dire. This is all happening in the fall of 1836. Winter is approaching and the Mormons have now been dispossessed to their property and cannot stay long term under threat of violence and death. They need to find somewhere new to go quickly before winter settles in. So Joseph Smith writes from Liberty jail to Brigham young and his friend Heber Kimble that the 12 apostles are now in charge.

And specifically whoever ' s the oldest apostle should take charge and be the . He doesn ' t know who that Brigham Young: is, but he says select whoever is oldest is president and he'll manage the 12 in managing the church while I'm in jail. Brigham young had been the third oldest apostle, but one of the apostles senior to him had left the church and another one had been killed at the battle of crooked river. So by pure chance, Brigham young is now in charge and Joseph Smith. Isn't able to give him details. Instructions. He basically just. Can you please figure this whole thing out. And obviously it couldn't be in worse circumstances. Where do you even start? You have thousands of people, nowhere to go and no resources to pay, to move them anywhere. I do think the average person, if they were put in this circumstance, the decision they would probably make is to put out a statement and basically say, Hey everyone, try to figure something out. But you all have to leave. Good luck. , but that's not what Brigham does. The first thing he does is go outside of Missouri, go to wealthier members of the church in other areas. And he secures funding from them. He says, look, the situation is dire. Why would you not help your fellow saints? So they all agree. And he very effectively and very quickly raises a lot of funds. He also begins helping the saints in Missouri, sell their property at heavily discounted price. , it had to be heavily discounted because the buyers knew they were desperate. And, um, most of them, you know, had been participating in mob violence against them. So they were not friendly, but still it's something he's getting some money for all their property. And as he's doing this other problems start solving themselves. The governor of Illinois offers refuge to the Mormons if they move there. So now he's got a place he's got the funds in mid-February 1839. Brigham goes to commerce, Illinois. And with the meager funds that he has, he buys some tracks of land in the nearby. He organizes the saints and puts them in companies organizes their transportation, food, temporary housing, and all the logistics with the movement of thousands of people from dozens of settlements to a new area in Illinois.

And it goes really well . , there ' s very little loss of life . , people are fed , people are housed , and this is the first time we truly get to see Brigham young as a genius of leadership and organization and Brigham Young: logistics, which he, he truly was. This is genius level organization in, exceptionally difficult circumstances. I think there's not one in a million people who could have pulled off this movement from Missouri to Illinois in those circumstances with essentially no loss of life and maintaining such a high level of organization, , despite constant harassment and violent attacks, the non-spiritual organization of the more movement had always been. Not not good. People were having incredible ecstatic, spiritual experiences under the leadership of Joseph Smith, but logistically things, uh, were not functioning smoothly, but then Brigham young takes the reins just for a little bit and immediately everything works great. Despite terrible circumstances. Having said that when Joseph Smith, escapes from jail, just a couple months later in April, he tells Brigham to stand down and he does no questions asked is now extremely obvious talent for leadership had not dented his loyalty to Joseph Smith in the slightest. And while Joseph Smith doesn't let Brigham young continue to run the church. He does give him an exciting new assignment. He sends a Brigham to England along with most of the other To oversee missionary work there. This is a great adventure for Brigham young, who had basically been on the frontier of America for his entire life. Now he gets to go to England and see the world, see castles and palaces and circuses and cathedrals for the first time It's a multi-month journey. And Brigham is horribly sick for most of it. And when he shows up in England, his first impression is to be shocked by the poverty of the English working class. Now, remember this is someone who rarely had shoes or pants without holes when he was growing up. Sometimes eating dinner meant going out and shooting a Robyn. And yet he was just gobsmacked by the poverty of the urban poor in England. And I think that tells you something about how horrible the conditions really were. The air was choked with smoke. People slept packed in tiny apartments, late sardines food was meager. Women were forced to work in factories alongside their husbands. Babies were so malnourished and cried so much. The opium use among babies was common to keep them I don't want to exaggerate. Because it wasn't all bad. Industrialization brought a lot of new luxuries and increased living standards for many, but for many others, it created truly hellish living conditions.

Perhaps , because of how horrible these conditions where Brigham and his compatriots have a lot of success in England and they weren ' t just baptizing these people , Brigham Young: but they're sending them back to the United States by the boatload. And you can imagine the appeal you're stuck doing factory work in Manchester or wherever, and suddenly a missionary comes and tells you that they're building the city of God in America. It's being led by a prophet and oh, by the way, if you convert, you can have a plot of land and plenty of materials to start a farm. The air and water are clean and the people are friendly. That's especially going to appeal to talented and enterprising Englishman who are nevertheless poor. I don't mean to downplay the importance of the religious message that they were sharing. And that was definitely at the core of why most people converted, but the economic factors certainly didn't hurt. So in England, Brigham young is having a lot of success with his message. He wrote to Joseph Smith quote. The people are very different in this country to what the Americans are. They do not seem to understand argument. Simple testimony is enough for them. They beg and plead for the book of Mormon. There is a great call for preaching in this region of the country. And that's great for Who, as you'll recall is not well-educated and doesn't Excel at complex arguments, but does Excel at connecting with people and forming friendships. But what he's really good at is leading the 12 apostles and organizing the church. Whereas there had been a lot of contention and infighting under some of his predecessors. Brigham was very good at massaging personalities, managing conflict and getting everyone on the same page and getting them to work together. The other thing he excels at is practical organization. He's overseeing the acquisition of land, , the printing of church materials, . Including books of scripture and song and even a church newspaper. He's organizing congregations and organizing large scale migrations of people to the United States. In Brigham's time in England, which was in 1840 and 1841, he oversees the baptisms of nearly 8,000 converts. He was also able to completely clear up any lingering acrimony between Joe Smith and the apostles by doing pretty simple stuff like regularly checking in and soliciting Joseph's advice. In one letter back to Joseph, he wrote quote, if you see anything in or about the whole affair, that is not right. I ask in the name of the Lord. Jesus Christ. That you would make known to us the mind of the Lord and his will concerning", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/brigham-young", "title": "Brigham Young", "chunk_index": 22, "publication_date": "2022-09-09", "total_chunks_in_doc": 99}}

That you would make known to us the mind of the Lord and his will concerning Brigham Young: us. And that sort of thing is working. It's just reassuring to Joseph Smith to know that these apostles. Aren't trying to jockey for position or authority or power that, you know, Brigham young really wants to know what he thinks and he's being solicitous and wanting to know his advice and his thoughts. It helps him feel comfortable with what they're doing. In fact in April, 1841. Brigham as well as the other apostles are called back home to Illinois, to a city that had now been renamed Nauvoo and this was the new gathering place for the church. Once again, in Brigham's absence, the church had run into some issues. So you're not going to believe this, but just like in Kirtland, just like in Missouri, people in Illinois were not crazy about becoming minorities in their own state, especially since the Mormons tended to vote as a block. So the neighbors are upset again. And once again, there are also divisions within the church. One reason is that the church is building a new, beautiful temple in Nauvoo. You should Google At temple. Uh, but it's costing a lot of money and the church is deep And the other reason is that Joseph Smith has privately started to teach some pretty radical ideas. Mormonism at the beginning. Had not been much of a departure from mainstream Protestant Christianity with the exception of the book of But it's basic. Cosmology the basic way that it looks at and understands the universe, God, and our relationship to him, the purpose of life, all of that. It was not immediately obvious that Mormonism was very different from most Christian sets and most Christian thought. But in Nauvoo that was rapidly changing. So, um, here's some of the doctrines, some of the ideas that were really radical that Joseph Smith was starting to teach privately and were really upsetting people when they found out about him. The first is the idea that men and women truly are the children of God. , like the same species as God with the ability to become like him to become gods themselves. This doctrine has been paraphrased as the belief that as man now is God, once was, as God now is man may be. This wasn't fully preached until 1844, but, , it gives you an idea of the way things as part of that, there was this idea that God, the father, Jesus Christ in the holy ghost were three separate beings and not United in one as most mainstream Christianity", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/brigham-young", "title": "Brigham Young", "chunk_index": 23, "publication_date": "2022-09-09", "total_chunks_in_doc": 99}}
{"text": "preached until 1844 , but , , it gives you an idea of the way things as part of that , there was this idea that God , the father , Jesus Christ in the holy ghost were three separate beings and not United in one as most mainstream Christianity Brigham Young: believed. Mormon doctrine also asserts that God has a body of flesh and bones. Again, a very radical departure from what most Christians believe, who they, they conceive of God as a spirit being, uh, who has no body and no physical location. As you think about this logically, that means that there are many gods and goddesses out You know, if, if God, once was as man now is. That that logically leads you to believe that other people were also with him. And if we can become, as God is now, then that means. People are becoming like God all the time. Uh, so Mormons are still generally considered monotheists because we believe that there is only one God who we have anything to do with only one God who we pray to and worship. But technically speaking, Joseph Smith had begun to teach doctrine that suggested. That there were many gods out there. Uh, and that would have been very upsetting to a lot of people. Another radical doctrine was the idea of eternal marriage. Most Christians believed that in heaven, the righteous are like angels who eternally worship Joseph Smith asserted that under proper authority, husbands and wives could be sealed together in a union that would last not only for time, but also after death and into And that brings us to the most controversial teaching of all that of plural marriage. Also known as polygamy. Joseph Smith asserted that God had commanded him to re-institute the practice of men taking more than one wife, just like David Moses and Abraham had in the old Testament, in the Bible. And, uh, of course just Smith is the first one to start taking plural wise. And so he, um, yeah, he's got more than one wife in Knoxville. And this, as you might imagine, was extremely controversial. Joseph Smith of course knew that this would not be popular and did not preach plural marriage openly, but performed plural marriages in secret and only taught the doctrine to a very few in his inner circle. In fact, uh, he never publicly acknowledged teaching plural marriage. And unsurprisingly, uh, it's still controversial to this day. Some people see in plural marriage, a thin excuse for Joseph Smith to have extra marital affairs while others view it as an attempt to live a religious commandment, despite intense societal disapproval. Whichever way you view it. It was not popular in many people when they found out about plural marriage, not only left the church, but became intense and ardent opponents of When Brigham young gets back", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/brigham-young", "title": "Brigham Young", "chunk_index": 24, "publication_date": "2022-09-09", "total_chunks_in_doc": 99}}

It was not popular in many people when they found out about plural marriage , not only left the church , but became intense and ardent opponents of When Brigham young gets back Brigham Young: from England, he's talking about plural marriage by Joseph Smith. He is of course taken aback by it. He later said, quote, At the time Joseph revealed the doctrine. I was not desirous of shrinking from my duty nor a failing in the least to do as I was commanded. But it was the first time in my life that I had desired the grave. And I could hardly get over it for a long time. And when I saw a funeral, I felt the envy, the corpse at situation. I think as he's taught plural marriage, he understands whoa. But people are not going to let this rest, like this is going to create conflict for the rest of my life. But, you know, Brigham, he accepted every word that came out of the mouth of Joseph Smith, including these ones. So within a couple of weeks, he comes around and an 1842 Brigham young married his first plural wife and he takes him more in 1843. The fact that Brigham young was one of the first men talk about plural. Marriage shows that when he came back from England, he was for the first time truly in Joseph Smith's inner circle. In another sign of Brigham young and the apostles new place in Joseph's inner circle, they were some of the first people to be shown the new temple rituals that Joseph Smith was developing. , these were new, highly ritualistic ceremonies, more similar to a Catholic mass or a Masonic ceremony than a traditional Protestant church meeting. And they were to be carried out in the Nauvoo temple once completed. So, because of all this, the church is swirling with controversy, but Navu is actually thriving as a city. It's swelling with converts from all over the United States and from Britain, it's actually rivaling Chicago as the biggest city in Illinois, with more than 12,000 people in it. It's got this beautiful, nearly complete temple at its center, lovely homes, thriving industry, a flourishing civil society, entertainment, art. It's got it all and bring them as right at the heart of all of this. As a master Cassman, he's helping to build the temple as an apostle. He's helping to organize. Tonies and instruct the people.

Several disaffected members of the church, start a newspaper called the Nauvoo expositor and publish an expo essay on Joseph Smith, plural marriages, and some of his more radical teachings. In retaliation, Joseph Smith has the Nauvoo city council put the paper on trial, declared a nuisance in order its destruction. Uh, posy of several hundred men stormed the building of the expositor and destroy their printing press. This really set off alarm bells for surrounding non-Mormons, who viewed this as a flagrant violation of the freedom of the press. And they viewed it as symbolic of Mormon disregard for civil .

They petitioned the state governor who, uh, who hears about this printing press being destroyed and feels compelled to act.

Stormed Joseph Smith jail cell and killed him and his brother Hiram on June 27th, 1844. At the time of Joseph's death, brigham had recently arrived in Boston, Massachusetts. He had just recently been sent there on a mission by Joseph Smith. And when he first heard the news, he was totally despondent and momentarily entered a deep depression. He said he didn't cry, but the main physical expression of his pain was a crushing headache. Like he had never felt before. He wondered if the great project of his adult life was now finished, he had committed his whole soul to following Joseph Smith and now Joseph was dead.

That know the power and authority to carry the work forward , remained with the apostles and remained with Brigham Young: him specifically. He was filled with a conviction that he and the apostles needed to take control of the church and keep the work going. Keep the church moving forward. He hurried back to Nauvoo while also writing to other apostles and encouraging them to come back as quickly as possible. Back in Nauvoo people were wondering what would happen. Now, the church was directionless. Everything had revolved around Joseph Smith and there was no clear air apparent. The most likely candidate to lead the church now was a man by the name of Sidney Rigdon. I mentioned him a couple of times. The highest governing body of the church was the first presidency. Originally that was a council made up of three people. Joseph Smith was the president, and then he had two counselors in the first presidency to advise and assist them. Sidney Rigdon was the first counselor in the first presidency. And so he had a very strong claim that he was the highest position in the church other than Joseph Smith and was there for the proper heir to the throne. So to speak. But there was a few problems with Sidney Rigdon. One was that he was bipolar and went through huge mood swings. He also had about with malaria. And was frequently not healthy. The result was someone who was seen as unsteady and unreliable. The other issue was that Sidney Rigdon was not on board with all the new and radical doctrines that Joseph Smith had started teaching toward the end of his while he never formally left or turned against the church. He had been removed from Joseph's inner circle. They maintained a friendly relationship up until the very end. And in fact, Joseph never even removed him as first counselor. But Joseph never showed Sydney. The temple rituals didn't teach him the newest doctrines. And as time went on, he didn't include him in the most important meetings. So Sidney Rigdon did have a great claim, but he wasn't a slam dunk. There were a number of other potential leaders of the church and rumors, gossip and speculation were flying around. Naville it's interesting to read accounts from the time. It's a little bit like, uh, the beginnings of a presidential cycle here in the United States, right. Everyone is, , kind of placing their bets in this horse And people are bringing up different people that it could be. They're speculating.

And it ' s interesting to read because if Brigham ' s name is mentioned at all in these early accounts , he ' s usually only mentioned like fourth or people Brigham Young: did not consider him to be a strong contender to take over the church. So Sidney Rigdon had been in Pittsburgh when Joseph Smith died. So he was closer to Nauvoo and he shows up weeks before Brigham young does, and he starts openly campaigning to be Joseph Smith successor. There were a few apostles who were in Nauvoo and they were trying to slow him down a little bit because there's this division between the apostles who wanted to follow Joseph Smith's bold new vision, these new doctrines, new teachings. And Sidney Rigdon and others who wanted to follow the old steady kind of safer more traditionally Christian path. So there are very different competing visions for the church. And everyone knows that it's ultimately going to come down to who the people choose to follow. So Sidney Rigdon, schedule's a big event for August 8th. He's going to pitch the church on his leadership and ask them to vote on him as the new leader of the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints. But the apostles start complaining that, Hey, you can't do this without everyone here. So he makes some concessions says, okay, well, this August 8th meeting is actually just going to be a prayer meeting. And then he vacillates back and forth. So as well, maybe we'll vote on who the new leader will be. Uh, maybe it'll just be a prayer meeting, I guess. Um, so this meeting is going to happen on August 8th and it's ambiguous. What is going to Brigham young arrives in the Nick of time. He gets to Nauvoo on the night of August 6th. So just a day and a half before this meeting. And he's actually not invited. The apostles are sort of boycotting this meeting. And they don't want to give it. Uh, official sanction, basically. Um, and no one has a prized Brigham young, no one has told him that this was going Luckily for him on the morning of August 8th, he happens to be walking by when he sees. This giant meeting happening. All of these people streaming. To this one area where Sidney Rigdon is, uh, is preaching. So he stops in and listens as Sidney Rigdon makes his case.

And he's about to close and ask for a vote on the matter. When Brigham young steps out onto the stage. This sends waves through the crowd. Most people didn't even know that he had returned from Boston yet. And all of a sudden there appears Brigham young. And, uh, I, this to me is like a moment from professional wrestling. Sidney Rigdon is about to win it. The wrath is raising his hand. They're bringing out the championship belt and. W wait a minute. Is that Brigham Young's music. Oh my gosh.

This is really smart because he stops Sidney Riggins. Momentum. And he also now is seen as the authority figure of like, Hey, don't worry yet, guys. I got it. I'll organize all of this.

So when they reconvene at 2:00 PM it's Brigham's chance to speak and he gives a thundering speech. He wasn't the, uh, fluid eloquent. A well-reasoned logical speaker that Sidney Rigdon was, he didn't, you know, have the clear chain of argument. But he was charming, funny and powerful. Brigham young argued that it was the apostles who carried the authority to leave the church after Joseph's death. In contrast to Sidney Rigdon who wanted to lead the church, as he said, as a guardian. , Brigham suggested that the apostles would become the new first presidency and continue to lead the church with all the same power and authority that Joseph Smith had. He's got a biting sense of humor. He's got a great line in there. He makes son of Rigdon for only wanting to be the guardian. He says, quote, do you want the church organized? Or do you want a spokesman, a cook, a bottle washer. I love that. Like, Um, uh, D do you want a profit or do you want a nanny? Cause that's what he's offering to do is be a nanny for the church. . And now when Brigham young was done, Sidney Rigdon had a chance to respond. And Sidney Rigdon, you know, he's looking at Brigham young Brigham, Young's got the, the other 11 apostles behind him. And so it seems like. He's got a lot of support. A lot of people behind him and Sidney Rigdon wants to show that he has support from others as well. It's not just him making this case. So, uh, so he doesn't want to give his rebuttal. He calls on a loyal friend and a prominent Mormon named WW Phelps to speak on his behalf. So Phelps gets Called on by Sidney Rigdon, but he was so moved by Brigham's That he spoke in favor of Brigham young taking charge of the church. And this is another wrestling move, right? The guy switches teams midway through the match. Oh my gosh. He's turning on Sidney Rigdon. What's this? He's putting him into a power slam. , amazing.

He has realized his dreams and taking charge of the only thing that he loves in life, which is, , this church, this message Mormonism.

And the other involved direct action. He always preferred direct action. And in fact, Brigham young expressed as much in a letter, he wrote back to Joseph Smith from England. He said, quote, Our motto is, go ahead. Go ahead and ahead. We are determined to go till we have conquered every foe. So come life or come death. We'll go ahead. But tell us if we're going wrong.

I'm not trying to upset So if I do anything wrong, I'm going to ask for forgiveness, but I'm not going to ask for permission. So tell me where I'm wrong, but I'm going ahead. And in many ways, I think this is the opposite of what people think of as a religious leader. I mean, what is it that makes religious leaders different in most people's minds? It's that they don't do things right. They don't do bad things. They don't do drugs. They don't lie. They don't steal. They don't make mistakes. That's what defines a Saint, right? They're perfect. They don't make any mistakes.

{"text": "' t do drugs . They don ' t lie . They don ' t steal . They don ' t make mistakes . That ' s what defines a Saint , right ? They ' re perfect . They don ' t make any mistakes . But that was Brigham Young: the opposite of Brigham young. He was action oriented and he would rather make mistakes. Then do nothing. So, for example, when Brigham young comes in and is put in charge of the Missouri Exodus, He doesn't start convening meetings, building consensus, or asking Joseph Smith for more and more details on exactly what he should do. He just starts gathering funds, selling property and moving people right away. He acts, when he stumbles on Sidney Riggins meeting, he doesn't say, Hey, this is happening too fast. Let's talk about this some more and vote on it later. He says, No. Hey, the other possibles need to be here. So let's have another meeting at 2:00 PM, but let's get this taken care of right away. So I try and remember that. I really liked that motto from Brigham young. Go ahead. And he always acted decisively. It's one of my big takeaways from how he had so much success. Go ahead. Okay. Uh, that's it. I hope you enjoyed part one tune in soon to hear part two on the life of Brigham young. ‚Äç Hello, and welcome to how to take over the world. This has been Wilson. This is part two on a series of the life of Brigham young, the prophet and president of the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints. First governor of the state of Utah and colonizer of the American west. Just to remind you kind of where we left kind of the story off. , in 1844, Joe Smith is murdered and it's not immediately clear. What's going to happen to the church that he founded and left behind. It's not clear who, if anyone will leave the church. But Brigham young returns from a mission out east says that the authority to lead the church is what the apostles and that he, as the senior, most impossible. Um, has the authority in particular to be the leader? There's a big standoff with another church leader named Sidney Rigdon and, uh, uh, the church votes basically unanimously for Brigham young to lead them. And so he becomes the new leader of the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints. We're in the city of Nauvoo Illinois, which Joe Smith had established. And Brigham young has just taken control. He is 43 years old. Today, we're going to go through the rest of the life.

Brigham young , how he led Brigham Young: thousands of people across the continental United States to establish a new state in the American west with a new people and a new way of life. And, you know, you know, one of the reasons that I got into this story is because. I think that is so interesting that he was able to do this, to build new cities, um, kind of kind of a new kingdom as is really probably the best way to think about it. And I think that's an opportunity that is more open and available than it has been since the time of Brigham young with the rise of remote work. There has been a big increase in the number of people who are thinking about this and trying to do things in this arena of building new cities. Um, Um, or new states, new countries, new, new, new ways of living. And I'm friends with two of those people. Um, and so I guess I will dedicate this episode to them. Uh, Uh, Dryden and Kevin, I hope two of you are able to take inspiration from the way Brigham young was able to do things in, in his quest to establish this. This new thing. Uh, Uh, so let's get into it, but first a word from our sponsors. üìç üìç Today's episode is brought to you by tiny capital. We talk a lot about building empires and leaving legacies on how to take over the world. And nothing is sadder to me than when a beautiful legacy goes to waste like Alexander, the Great's empire falling apart right after his death. You want to be more like the Ross child whose financial empire lasted decades or even better like Caesar whose empire lasted hundreds of years. That's where tiny capital comes in. For over a decade. They have been partnering with founders to give them quick, straightforward, exits that protect their team and culture and keep their businesses operating for the long When you sell the tiny it's incredibly fast and easy, you avoid the long back and forth and life or death negotiations. You get a fair deal that gives you cash, but also build for the longterm and protects your legacy going forward. It's a really great company that is building an empire of their own by building the right way. I'm really impressed with how they do business.

So he becomes the leader and Sidney Rigdon, this rival leader who lost says, okay, well, forget this. I'm going to take the people who will follow me. And I'm leading, I'm starting my own thing. So he goes back to Pittsburgh. And starts his own church. And not that many people follow him, but if you do. And in the coming months, Brigham young would face other splinter groups as well as even more people who don't necessarily join splinter groups, but just sort of sort of wander away. Many of them would go to St. Louis, which was a BoomTown at the time and not very far away. So Brigham Young's first immediate goal is all right. Let's stop the bleeding. Uh, let's stop hemorrhaging people because at this point, the whole church, the whole movement is at risk of breaking up and falling apart. This was made more difficult by the fact that just like in Ohio and Missouri, moms of non-Mormons were threatening to burn their houses and drive them out of the state. Brigham is absolutely committed that this will not happen again. They've been driven out of Ohio and Missouri. But he does not want the same thing to happen in Illinois and he especially doesn't want it to happen right now. That would be too much change all at once. Right. You imagine you're a convert. Right. In England who has just converted to Mormonism and here Joseph Smith is dead. Okay. If you also hear Nauvoo is destroyed and everyone is scattering, you probably start to think, okay. Party's over, maybe this was a bad idea. And, um, um, those types of situations can snowball and before, you know, it. you know, The whole thing is over. So for now, his priority is to keep everyone together. Don't get driven out. So the Navu Legion, which is their militia stays on high alert through 1844. Brigham young himself has armed guards, 24 hours a day. That's the state of heightened fear that Brigham young in particular and", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/brigham-young", "title": "Brigham Young", "chunk_index": 34, "publication_date": "2022-09-09", "total_chunks_in_doc": 99}}

That ' s the state of heightened fear that Brigham young in particular and Brigham Young: the church as a whole we're in, at the time. But throughout 1844, they're sort of able to keep the situation more or less stable. sort of Uh, and in large part, I think that's because. Um, the people who had killed Joseph Smith. Fi, but this would be the end of the movement. And so they're not super concerned with keeping the pressure up on the sort of persecution. They think things are going to unravel now. Um, But it becomes clear throughout using 44. Uh, as Brigham young takes control that, oh, the Mormons are not breaking apart and leaving. So more needs to be done. Um, Um, so then something big happens in January of 1845. The charter of the city of Nauvoo is revoked by the legislature of the state of Illinois. And that charter, which was essentially the constitution of the city of Nauvoo had been very generous. It allowed Navu to have their own mayor, their own city council established their own courts, have their own militia. And someone has revoked. All of that becomes illegal. Essentially. They're not allowed to have their own courts. They're not allowed to have their own militia to defend themselves. They don't have their own government. And this is bad for a number of reasons. Number one is probably the physical protection from mobs. Without the militia, you're not going to be able to protect yourselves. And, um, But another big thing is harassing lawsuits. So you got a bunch of people suing senior church leaders for damages and property. And you've got a lot of people trying to serve indictments or criminal charges. And without their own court system. Even if Brigham young is never convicted of anything, his enemies are going to be able to ruin his life with dozens of lawsuits and criminal charges. So starting in 1845. Uh, Brigham young in particular is vulnerable to arrest and the saints as a whole are vulnerable to violent attacks, whether military or vigilante. But for the time being what Brigham does in 1845 is essentially ignore this development. He keeps the Nauvoo Legion armed and ready, even though that's technically illegal now. And he ignores a lot of the subpoenas and lawsuits and just refuses to appear in court In one particular case, some officials come and serve him and arrest warrant. And, uh, uh, he sends out a man, a friend dressed in his coat and top hat who they then take the prison.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/brigham-young", "title": "Brigham Young", "chunk_index": 35, "publication_date": "2022-09-09", "total_chunks_in_doc": 99}}

Brigham Young: Uh, thinking that is Brigham young and they free him later that day, when they realized that they had been duped. So, you know, So, you know, this is how close the calls are that he's literally having to send out. Uh, Uh, body doubles in order to avoid arrest. So under this sort of siege environment, Brigham introduces some extra security measures. One of these is something called the whistling and whittling brigade. This is initiative to drive dissenters, apostates, criminals, and antagonists out of Naville. Um, They're already kind of in hot water with the Illinois government. So they can't just kick out people and say, we kicked them out because they were critical of our religion. Um, So it has to be a little more clever about it. So what he does. Used to get these young men. To follow around these undesirables and they whistle. Uh, and which is supposed to be obnoxious and annoying. And at the same time, they're whistling. They widdle. Uh, so they take out their knives and they carve some wood. And this is meant to be vaguely threatening. Right? You've got Right? people following you around whistling to annoy you and withdrawn knives. While also maintaining plausible deniability. They're just whittling. We're just carving wood. I was not threatening him. Officer, uh, I don't know what he's talking about, right. Um, and this kind of initiative, um, works. I mean, it sounds kind of sinister, but um, I mean, kind of it's, it's a pretty smart approach. It does intimidate these people. Many of them leave. Um, Um, You have these types of initiatives, because at this time, Brigham young, his leadership style changes 180 degrees. From what we saw in last episode, he had been very collaborative and inclusive and he got that leadership style from Jeff Smith. Joseph had been collaborative, inclusive, empowering, and very forgiving of other people. But I think for Brigham Young's attitude. Now he says, well, well, look what they're at. Got him. They got him killed. So Brigham commits to act differently from now on, he's going to be authoritarian and come down hard on descent in order to ensure that you don't have these kinds of incidents in the future, you don't have the danger of. Assassinations. This works", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/brigham-young", "title": "Brigham Young", "chunk_index": 36, "publication_date": "2022-09-09", "total_chunks_in_doc": 99}}

Assassinations . This works Brigham Young: to keep the situation stable. And, you know, you know, we'll see throughout this episode. Uh, this change has various consequences, some good, some bad. Um, Um, but all these initiatives that Brigham young introduces work to keep the situation stable through the first half of 1845. And then in August anti-Mormon mobs begin burning outlying settlements outside. And then in the late summer, so August and September of 1845 Mormon start retaliating and they start burning the homes and crops of non-Mormons who were suspected mobbers. So what you're seeing is almost an exact one for one replay of what happened to the saints in Missouri. So the governor of Illinois, his name is governor Ford. He's really committed to not letting a civil war break out. So he sends a state militia it's led by Steven Douglas, the famous statesman who would go on to have famous debates with Abraham Lincoln later in his life. Uh, Uh, he comes to Nauvoo and he sits down with Brigham young and negotiates an agreement. And the agreement is that in the spring of 1846, The Mormons are going to leave. Nauvoo. And what they get for that is Stephen Douglas basically says we will ensure your safety until then. So we'll make sure the mobs stay off your backs. If you will leave. As soon as spring comes. And Brigham young grease to this. As I said, he really wanted to keep everyone together. Um, but he knew that they were going to have to move on. Eventually. He just wants to be able to move on. Of their own accord. Uh, he wanted to be able to walk out and not be driven out. Uh, Uh, that was really important to him. One of the reasons that he wanted a little bit more time was to complete the Nauvoo temple. Now, this seems like kind of kind of an odd priority. You know, You know, you're about to leave the city. So why are you trying so hard to build this? Large decadent, beautiful building that you're not going to be able to use for very long. But the latter day saints are very excited about these new rituals that we're going to be revealed in the temple. So they want to complete the temple and participate in these rituals before they have to leave, because who knows how long it's going to be before they complete another temple and are able to receive, uh, these rituals.

So they want to complete the temple and participate in these rituals before they have to leave , because who knows how long it ' s going to be before they complete another temple and are able to receive , uh , these rituals . Also , Brigham Young: they'd put a lot of blood, sweat and tears into constructing the step bolt. So I think when you've worked so hard on something, you just want to see the thing through, you want to see it completed, even if you're not going to be able to use it for very long. So through the end of 1845, they're working hard to complete this temple and they do in November and December of 1845 and January of 1846, they're able to use it. There's this huge outpouring of spiritual enthusiasm as Brigham young standardizes and introduces the temple ceremonies that had been taught to him by Joseph Smith before his death. So people are literally cramming into the temple. Day and night. Uh, they're conducting. Ceremonies at night as well. Uh, there's so many people who want to participate in these, in these new ceremonies. And, um, um, there's a lot of celebrating their singing and dancing inside the temple. And Brigham literally goes and lives in the temple for a while. He's sleeping there. He's staying there day and night. Um, Both because he wants to officiate these ceremonies for as many people as possible. And because he feels safe there, he's surrounded by friends. And so it's probably safe from assassination attempts or attempted arrests. But at the same time that there is a spiritual outpouring, unfortunately, stephen Douglas wasn't fully able to follow through on his promises and mobs begin to attack the saints. Once again, in the late winter. Which is a little early, they were, they were supposed to have until spring. To get out of the city. So Brigham young realizes that they won't be able to make their plan departure time in the spring. So on February 15th, 1846, while the Mississippi river was still frozen over. Brigham young and the saints begin driving their wagons over the frozen ice. To temporary encampments on the Iowa side of the river. Um, so Navi was right on the Mississippi. Uh, they're in Illinois, Iowa is just on the other side. So, uh, that was their agreement that they would get out of Illinois. So they crossed the river in February of 1846. Some Mormons still lingered in Navu, especially those who were poor and maybe didn't have the resources couldn't afford to get a wagon and leave. But over the coming months, they were harassed. They were beaten.

They were driven by the mobs and, uh, uh, by September virtually the whole body of the church was gone from Illinois. The novel era of Mormonism was over. um, And this was when the Brigham young era of Mormonism would really begin. He was. Leading a people in the wilderness. Once again. I should mention the. Not every latter day, Saint left Nauvoo most notably Emma Smith, the widow of Joseph Smith did not leave. She and her children stayed in Nauvoo she and Brigham fought and they fought ugly. They did not like each other at all. Uh, Uh, there's a big falling out. And part of it was that Joseph Smith himself had not had a great relationship with his wife right before he died. She was not happy about plural marriage about polygamy. Uh, which he had introduced shortly before he was murdered, which I think is understandable. But also there were arguments about property. So just Smith had not really kept his property. Uh, very separate from the property of the church in general, it was unclear what belonged to him personally. And what was church property? And so of course, when he dies. Emma says. It's all my property as his widow, it all belongs to him and bring him says, no, it all belonged to the church. And. Uh, the church could take custody of it. And so they have this falling out and Emma actually doesn't ever follow Brigham west. Uh, Uh, she, along with her children. Stayed in Nauvoo and established something called the reorganized church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints. It was supposed to be the same church. Uh, Uh, she just believed that Brigham young had essentially stolen the church and that Joseph Smith intended for his sons to take over the church after he died. And so in the reorganized church, which was always smaller uh, than the segment you. Led by Brigham young. Um, Um, Joseph Smith, the third, the son of Joseph Smith became the prophet. Once he came of age, you still a boy at this time, but eventually he would become a prophet. And the reorganized church really? Deemphasized Joseph Smith's leaders teachings. In fact, most of them. They didn't acknowledge. It just had ever taught. They dismissed them as inventions of Brigham young. Uh, Uh, they said they never happened. But most historians agree that this is not true.

But most historians agree that this is not true . Most historians agree that Joseph Smith Brigham Young: did teach these things. Uh, Uh, but the reorganized church rejected plural marriage. They had no temple ceremonies. They didn't believe in plurality of gods or that men could become gods. They didn't believe in gathering to a single city and creating this earthly kingdom. It was essentially. Uh, Uh, mainstream Protestant church, the happened to believe in the book of Mormon. I say it was, but the church still exists. It's now called the community of Christ. And luckily for them at the time, they didn't get persecuted in the same way that Brigham and his followers did. And that's because they had ejected all the weirdness out of the church. And so the question is, um, why didn't bring them follow this path because it seems a lot easier, right? And the answer is that he was obsessed with Joseph Smith and he was obsessed with following Joseph's vision. And, you know, you know, the primary thing in justice vision was creating a literal kingdom up, uh, people from this church, it wasn't enough to have just a church, right. With congregations all over the place, the experiment required an independent political entity. And that is what Brigham young would spend the rest of his life fighting for. And so if they had to endure. Being on the road and during persecution and fights and all that. And that's what they would do. So in order to do that, they needed a new gathering place. Um, So early in 1846. They're strewn out all over Iowa. Right? The orders were basically get out of Dodge, get out of Illinois. But there isn't a place to go yet. So Brigham young establishes a new meeting place in Nebraska. It's meant to just be temporary before they can find the final spot for their new kingdom. And so the city is called winter quarters because they were just supposed to quarter there for the winter. Uh, currently it's just outside of Omaha. I think it's basically a suburb of Omaha at this point. Uh, but at the time, it's totally unoccupied. And so he has all the Mormons go there. And once again, Brigham young is in his element.

He ' s literally in the mud with people helping them push their wagons . And I think Brigham Young: it's really interesting to see how he's able to do this so effectively. Brigham Young's one written revelation has one message from God that silver found that it gets put in scripture alongside the Bible in the book of Mormon is basically an org chart. Um, Which is really interesting. Okay. So here's what it says. And I'm quoting here. Let the companies be organized with captains of hundreds, captains of fifties and captains of 10. With a president and two counselors at their head under the direction of the 12 apostles. Let each company provide themselves with all the teams, wagons, provisions, clothing. And other necessities for the journey that they can. But each company with their captains and presidents decide how many can go next spring. Then choose out a sufficient number of able-bodied and expert men to take teams seeds and farming utensils. To go as pioneers to prepare for putting in spring crops. Okay, so basic instructions. You had these captains tens, fifties, hundreds, and then a president in two counselors Over each wagon train. So, um, So, um, It's not rocket science. Right. Right. But what it is is is very simple and it can be implemented very quickly. And very quickly provides just enough structure to help people know what to do, how to move, and also provides a very efficient reporting structure. If there's a problem, you only need, you know, you know, four or five conversations before it makes its way to Brigham young, to the very top. And this is great practice. Uh, Uh, the management consulting firm McKinsey put out an analysis in 2020. That the most agile organizations have no more than six layers of management. And that's not just McKinsey. You hear that a lot in consulting circles that the. The optimal number. Um, for, for management layers is somewhere around 5, 6, 7. Um, it's pretty low actually. Sometimes you'll see a couple more. Uh, depending on the organization. And Brigham young was not someone who was reading McKinsey reports or even the 1840s equivalent of McKinsey reports, but he did have a very intuitive understanding of what worked in effective management, especially in a crisis. So using this very bare bones, efficient organizing structure, he manages to gather the latter day saints to winter quarters. There they plant crops and prepare to leave for the west in the spring of 1847, the spring next year.

And I Brigham Young: say the west Brigham young was pretty sure where they're going to go at this point, but a lot of people didn't know yet. There were a lot of potential places that they could go. Some people were thinking California, somewhere thinking Oregon, Vancouver island, Mexico. And of course a Utah where they did end up going. And Brigham young says he has seen the place in division in he'll know it when he gets there. Privately he's telling people it's probably the salt lake valley. But as they're getting settled in winter quarters and getting prepared to take a journey the next year, It's a pretty tough year. Uh, Uh, that they spend in winter quarters. Everyone is just living in these log cabins. Right? Th they know they're not going to stay so they don't make any real efforts to make it nice and comfortable. Um, it's just a halfway point and it's cold there's disease. Everyone is poor. They just left. Nauvoo under duress. Understandably people are not in a great mood. So in the face of this difficulty, some people start to resist and challenge the leadership of Brigham young. And they're like, man, you have not got us in a, in a good spot where the Brigham. And what do you do when times get tough like this? I think for many people, probably for myself, Um, The instinct would be all right. Let's be conciliatory. Let's be nice. Let's people aren't happy. Let's give them something. Um, but it turns out that's what weak leaders do. Strong leaders know that tough times. Or when you challenge your followers, so step it up and do more, do better. And that's what Brigham does here. He goes to the people and says, I know we're unhappy. And guess what it's, because you're wicked, you're not obedient enough to me and to God and you need to repent. And he goes on kind of this kind of barnstorming tour through winter quarters.

Are obedient or strongly following him. Um, Um, then in the second half of 1846, Brigham takes a much more measured approach. And, um, um, and relaxes a little bit and emphasize a singing and dancing, raising everyone's spirits. In fact, at the time he says one of my favorite quotes. I want my favorite Brigham young quotes.

Um, well, Um, well, this time at winter quarters is very important for a number of reasons. Um, one of which is they're preparing to leave. Yes. But also. It's the Mormon's first opportunity to openly live. Plural marriage amongst themselves. So Nauvoo, it had always been hush, hush. hush, It always been a secret. Joe Smith was practicing it. He got his apostles and some top leadership of the church to also engage in plural marriage. But no one knew no one felt comfortable discussing it or being open about it generally. And in winter quarters that changes Brigham young is walking around with his various wives. He's got a couple of big log cabins that he builds where he's housing, multiple wives together, and these sort of big communal households. And a few other apostles are doing the same. And it's not just plural marriage, but really Mormons have their first chance to live. Completely to themselves. W without having to worry about prying eyes. Right. In Missouri and Illinois, there were other settlements nearby, even though they had their own cities. But here in winter quarters in Nebraska.

Um, And so they're doing lots of things, um, um, that are kind of different. kind of So bring them institutes, a new doctrine called the law of adoption. So the idea behind this as. Um, Um, okay. You're getting married to various women and taking them as wives. And in. Mormon parlance. That's called getting sealed. Okay. So. The ceiling you can think is like welding is another way Joe Smith described it. So getting welded to these women as wives, so that you're connected to them forever. These are eternal marriages. Well Well now Brigham young. Uh, rolls out this thing called the law of adoption, where you can get sealed to various men and take them as surrogate sons. Uh, another way to connect to yourself. To people that you, you know that you know and love. Um, But what this also is, is, is you really seeing a pivot to what you might call old Testament Christianity no longer is the model. For how to live a good Christian life. Within this Mormon community. It's not. You know, You know, it's not Paul Wright who was kind of urbane, educated and celibate, as far as we know. Um, Um, You get the idea from Paul that to him, maybe the ideal life is one that is detached from earthly cares. Impoverished. And dedicated entirely to prayer and praise and God. But the primary model for Brigham is not that. Um, he's trying to emulate. The patriarchs. Abraham Isaac and Jacob violent men with large households of wives, children, and servants. um, so with this law of adoption, you know, you know, Brigham, especially Brigham young, but also other senior apostles and leaders in the church, like Heber C Kimball, Parley, Pratt. They're forming these little tribes. They've got all these, you know, adopted sons. Sometimes those adopted sons have adopted sons. Uh, people try to conduct business within their tribes. Uh, sometimes people even speak in that way. They talk about the tribe of Brigham. Um, or the tribe of Heber, right. Are they trying to do favors for those that they've adopted? They're basically establishing patronage networks. And it's interesting to see, you know, in some ways Brigham young you know, is in the same circumstances as Moses.", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/brigham-young", "title": "Brigham Young", "chunk_index": 44, "publication_date": "2022-09-09", "total_chunks_in_doc": 99}}

And it ' s interesting to see , you know , in some ways Brigham young you know , is in the same circumstances as Moses . Brigham Young: He's leading a people in the wilderness, taking them to a promised land, trying to ensure their survival and their obedience to God. And he responds to the similar circumstances by developing an old Testament theology. And an old Testament way of life. Um, Um, so maybe it really is as simple as, so circumstances kind of kind of dictate. Uh, the beliefs and practices of many religions. You know, You know, that law of adoption is wouldn't survive for very long. It's not practiced anymore. And Mormonism. Um, and it wasn't practiced for very long. But I think it's interesting. That the precedent is there in Mormon history and doctrine. And it's interesting to me to see. Brigham young. Trying to branch out into something that was truly. Unique, truly very different and weird. Uh, compared to what American Christians were used to. And by the way, you know, how does this work? Can only a few people be Abraham's. Uh, Brigham young has a good quote where he lays out kind of the. The fractal nature of how this was supposed to work. He says, and I'm quoting here, say that I'm ruling over 10 sons or subjects. And soon each one of them would have 10 men sealed to them. And then would be ruler over them. That would make me ruler over 10 presidents or Kings. So in other words, these people had been worried like, okay, so I want to be a president or a king. So, So, if I'm sealed to you as your son, Brigham, does that mean I can't be one anymore? And he says, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. This kind of works like an endless network, right? It's like a, it's a pyramid scheme. The Mormon love for pyramid schemes runs a really deep right. Hundreds of years old. Um, but kind of that's kind of his theology. Um, That, that would be the main thing that Brigham young tried to preach over the course of his career was this theology of increase that we're here. Um, To improve the world and to increase in knowledge in learning. In power in, in family. um, No we're supposed to. Improve and increase our property and our towns and our communities.

In the middle of a wilderness and trying to build a new kingdom. Out of scratch. So, um, So he's teaching all this. And then in 1847, the first company leaves from winter quarters and they now know basically where they're going. Although interestingly, Brigham young is still not saying exactly where they're going. But more or less, they're headed for Utah. And bringing me on leads, the first company. It's made up almost entirely of healthy young and middle-aged men. This is not supposed to be a normal migration. Like the ones that would come later. This was a trailblazing expedition they're supposed to not only go to Utah and set up camp, kind but also kind of make the map, find the trail set up. Markers established ferries, Fords, and mountain passes, measure distances. Uh, stuff like that stuff that will make the journey easier for those who come after. And so this is set up with military precision. Everyone gets up at 5:00 AM. They walk until 8:30 PM and are in bed by 9:00 PM. They have very regular prayer meetings. Uh, Uh, the average 15 to 20 miles a day, which is pretty good. Uh, And last episode, I talked a little bit about this very unique American environment that Brigham young came from where kind of this entrepreneurial spirit. This ingenuity was really widespread. And you can see that on display in this journey. One of the things I found most fascinating is there's a camp scribe, a guy by the name of William Clayton, and he collaborated with an apostle named Orson Pratt who had a little bit of mathematical training. And they got a carpenter in the camp to create a primitive odometer that designed it up and got them to build it. And this little thing could attach to one of the wagon wheels and it would click and it would track. Uh, the number of, of wheel turns throughout the day. And they use this odometer to get a measurement of how far they had traveled each day. And it was pretty good. It was pretty accurate actually. Uh, people have looked their measurements and. It was pretty accurate. So, I mean, to me, that's just So, I mean, amazing. Uh, that they were able to. To do that. You know, kind of with.

You know , kind of with . A Brigham Young: little bit of wood and some duct tape. Metaphorically speaking, um, um, with very little materials. I was just very impressed by the ingenuity. So they're headed out and they make it most of the way there. Uh, they're in Wyoming when they're met by a man named a Sam Brannan. Sam was a leader of a group of Mormons who had been , uh, on the east coast basically. And rather than trying to cross the Plains, they had made the voyage by ship. They boarded a boat called the Brooklyn and sailed all the way around Cape horn, up to San Francisco. And they land in San Francisco and their leader. Sam Brandon looks around and thinks well, We don't need to go any further. We have found paradise. This is where we should be. And if you've ever been to San Francisco, You know, You know, why, you know, you know, even take out all the buildings. Everything that's been built is just some of the best land on earth. It's beautiful. It's got terrific weather, a natural Harbor, good farm land. I mean, If you're a settler. That's where you want to land. So Sam comes out to Wyoming and basically says, Brigham. Um, Um, I'm hearing all this nonsense about Utah. You gotta be kidding me, man. This California place. San Francisco. It's amazing. Can't stop a new.you got to keep going. And Brigham says, no, we're going to Utah. And it's interesting to hear why he chose Utah specifically instead of California, Oregon, listen to this quote about Utah. He says, There are no locations, less desirable than this for any other purpose than the one for which we have selected it. Not for its intrinsic value in a pecuniary point of view. But in order that we might enjoy our religion in peace, preserve our youth in virtue and be freed from the insults abuses and persecution of our enemies. So in other words, Sam. I hear you, California. It sounds amazing. But we are intentionally going to the middle of nowhere. um, And that, so that no one will bother us so that we have a chance to live out this religious experiment in peace. And look, Utah is actually a pretty nice place.

Um , Um , but it is the desert and is very remote and very undesirable compared Brigham Young: to California and Oregon. And some of the other places that they could have settled. Uh, there's another good quote from Brigham young, where, uh, this pastor comes to Utah after it's been settled. And, uh, it says. uh, Three of them and knowing the Brigham has a religious man, he says, uh, Brigham, it's amazing. What you and God have been able to do. uh, With, uh, with this valley. And a Brigham gets a little smile and says, Yeah, well, well, you should have seen it when just God was in charge of it. Um, Um, And it's true. Like Like Utah's nice. But it's the desert and it is very undesirable. Especially compared to California and Oregon. So from Wyoming, Brigham ignores Sam Brandon's please. And they set out again for Utah. It's relatively uneventful. There are no adverse events, except for at the very end, Brigham gets something that they call mountain fever. It's probably a tick-borne disease, nothing too serious, but basically he has the flu for the very end of the journey. So when they get there to the salt lake valley, uh, He's laid up in the back of a wagon. And, um, um, they pull up, they show Brigham the valley. And Brigham says that he's had this vision of the exact place where they need to end up. So he looks out over the salt lake valley and says, this is the right place. Drive on. So, this is a very famous moment. In Mormon lore in Utah history in the retelling it's often shortened to this is the place. He actually said, this is the right place, but okay. That's fine. This is the place. And there's a park at the spot called this is the place park actually used to live right by it. And it's in the state song. This is the place. So that's a famous moment from, from Brigham young life. This is the place. So they pull into the salt lake valley and for a month, Brigham young recovers from this illness and helped lay out the roads divides the area into plots of land helps build some cabins.

So throughout 18 47, 18 48, he leads various wagon trains from winter quarters to salt lake city. Um, Again, this is really where he shined, organizing these mass movements of people. Uh, Uh, this is probably Brigham young at his peak. Migration is incredibly successful in the face of a lot of dangers and difficulties. The vast majority of saints made it safely. You know, they had to worry about wild animals, about bad water. Uh, finding food. Uh, Uh, native Americans that were often not friendly. Um, Crossing rivers and streams. Adverse weather events. Um, Um, but the sign, all this, according to one book I read, I think it was Brigham young and the expansion of the Mormon faith by Thomas Alexander. The death rate for Mormons on the Mormon trail was actually lower than the death rate for the United States as a whole. Uh, in other words, you were safer following Brigham young on the Mormon trail than you were just, you know, Being a Jack or Jill out in New York. And that says a lot about how successfully Brigham young manages this migration. Now this whole time, Brigham young has been leading the church as the senior apostle of the quorum of the 12 apostles. But it's around this time that Brigham young decides that this isn't working. It's not working for him to just be another apostle. I'll be at the senior most one, but not really differentiated that much. Uh, Uh, Parley Pratt and John Taylor are two apostles who come out in the first Vanguard company. In the Brigham Young's absence, they have been directing affairs in salt lake city. Which is fine. They're good leaders, but it's not long before some minor conflicts arise, differences of opinion, slightly different visions. And it just becomes clear to Brigham young that look not just with me. We're going to have all sorts of, of these. You can't have 12. People all equal. Running an operation like that just doesn't work. You got to have one person who is in control. So. So in the winter of 1847, he decides to reorganize the first presidency.

And he had two Brigham Young: counselors. And so Brigham young wants to bring this back with himself as president. And at first this is a post by the apostles, especially the brothers Parley, Pratt, Orson Pratt. And, um, um, you had to be approved by the apostles in order to happen. So it's not looking good. So he embarked on this campaign to persuade them, to reorganize the first presidency and declare him prophet of the church. And this is where you see how much Brigham young has changed since Joseph Smith's death. you know, Previously, you know, when he was in charge of the apostles in England, he was known for resolving conflicts, very peacefully for managing to accomplish things without ruffling feathers. But here. He takes the complete opposite approach. He basically brow beats the apostles into reestablishing. The first presidency. When Pratt tells him all the apostles are equal. Brigham says wrong. I am the mouthpiece. You are the belly. That's an actual coat. I'm mouthier the belly. Nice. Um, and about Parley Pratt and John Taylor, he says, I shall make Parley Pratt and John Taylor bow down. And confess that they are not Brigham young. He and probably have a big falling out over this. And when Parley finally relents and asks for forgiveness, Brigham responds, I forgive you. But I swear to you, I shall whip you and make you stick to me. So his leadership style has changed significantly to say the least, but it works. I mean, I mean, he. He becomes president. He become, you know, he gets through first presidency, just like you wanted. And, um, um, I do think on some level, this goes to show that you can't replace talent. If you're one of those great leaders are gonna figure it out, how to get it done one way or another. And with a man like Brigham young, uh, Uh, he'd get it done both the nice way and the ruthless way, whatever it took. So, So, uh, uh, yeah, winter of 1847, Brigham young becomes president of the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints. Um, And out in, uh, uh, And what we now know is Utah.

So they send a new petition to become a territory And they are granted territorial status though. The us government rejects the Mormon name of Deseret that was like, oh, little funky, a little weird. Uh, Uh, so instead they named the territory, Utah after the, uh, native American tribe that was most prominent in the area, the Utes, and they appoint Brigham young as territorial governor. The first thing they're bringing me on has to worry about. He's getting people established. Economically. No. I say economically, we think of economics. We think of money. Um, But it's not so much about money is it is about like, not starving. Uh, they need food right now. So, you know, So, you know, even though Brigham young is primarily a religious leader, supposedly he's not very focused on religion for the first few years, he's focused on farming on building sustainable communities. Um, and for a few years, you know, people are living. Britt and close to the starvation line. Um, . So this is not, you know, you know, something with low stakes. This is high stakes. Um, they're, So they're, they're digging canals. They're planting crops. They're. Uh, Uh, doing everything that it takes to, to survive. Now one problem with, uh, becoming a territory, not a state, is that territories? At the time and I think still are administered by the federal government in Washington. So that means they don't have any local government. So Brigham young is the territorial governor because he's appointed. The territorial governor by the president. But they don't have a locally elected government. And that means that in addition to Brigham young, There are people who are appointed to the government as judges and officials. And they're not Mormons third east coasters. They're Americans. They're non-Mormons. So in 1851, there's this judge, His name is And he comes out and at first he's open to Mormons. He thinks they got a raw deal in Missouri and Illinois, and he comes and, you know, you know, he's trying to be open minded and.

Of course , you know , you know , if you ' re going to come be a judge , uh , you like to get along with the people that Brigham Young: you're supposed to be living amongst. But he gets out to Utah and he can see. They're practicing polygamy, which the Mormons were not open about yet. And he can also see that it's a very theocratic state and their allegiance is more to each other, to the church and to Brigham young than it is to the United States of America. So he's got these two things in mind. Polygamy and this religious allegiance. So he gives a speech and in the speech, he says, you know, let's all work together to make this place better. And before, you know, it, you know, you all are going to be patriotic and law abiding and your women will be virtuous. And that was the wrong thing to say. The Mormons interpreted it as him saying that as a stands, your men are traders and your women are whores, but I can fix all that. So after a speech, Brigham young stands up and gives a fiery rebuttal. And he says that This is either profoundly ignorant or corruptly wicked. We love the government and the constitution, but we do not love the damned Rascals who administer the government. And then he says, You know, He's talking about bronchus and he says, Uh, look. I'm going to keep my comments pretty mild right now. Uh, I'm not going to say anything that could lead to the pulling of hair or cutting of throats. Okay. So officially he's trying to. Temper his words, lower the temperature of the room. He doesn't want these things to happen, but it has the opposite of the intended effect. Bronchus hears this and thinks, wait, I'm sorry. Cutting throats is on the table. This is not what I signed up for. So he thinks his life is in danger. And so he and the other judges flea, Utah, and go back to the, to the states. Uh, those officials who flee come to be known as the runaway judges. And Brigham young and others write to the government Um, Let's try and get ahead of the story. They know this Brock has guys can go back and say, Brigham young threatened my life and I had to get out of Dodge. So they say, look, this guy was no good. Um, They didn't understand us.

They thought it was gonna be hard to get people to settle there. So the fact that these Mormons are doing the hard work for them of settling you doc. They're happy to let them do it. So, um, So they send them new judges. Uh, those judges fleet and bring them in the Mormons, get some friendlier judges in their place. And so, um, so, um, The 1850s, uh, early 1850s are. Are pretty good. Uh, st. Starting to get established. There are fledgling towns with public buildings that are starting to pop up. And so Brigham young decides that this is the time. To announce polygamy to the world and, uh, uh, and let them know what they're doing. So in 1852, the church publicly. Announces that yes, we practice plural marriage. And I don't know that there is any great way to make that kind of announcement. Um, but if there is. They did not figure it out. Uh, Uh, this announcement does not go particularly well. A lot of people leave the church and missionary work basically grinds to a halt. Previously people had been able to dismiss polygamy as nothing more than a rumor. But now that they know it's real. Most people think that is very weird. They find it very odd. And so, so, uh, uh, yes, they're able to live how they wanted to live now fully, publicly, openly, but it comes at a high cost. Um, So Brigham young is teaching plural marriage, finally offering kind of theological defenses of plural marriage mites. Why it's necessary. And at this time, Brigham young is introducing other doctrinal innovations. One of these is called the Adam God theory. So, So, this is a theory that is. Uh, quite difficult to understand. Brigham young was not a theologian. So the Adam God theory was. Frankly, never totally coherent, but the gist of it was this. Adam the first man. Is God. The, he was God, our father and took human form in Adam much in the same way that Jesus was also God in human form. But, and this is where it gets complicated. Uh, he grants, the Adam is not Jesus.

The father, Jesus, the son and Adam, the grandson. Uh, so kind of like a third God. Lower. Um, So, you know, mind you, this is in the framework of. Uh, theology where anyone could become a God. So, uh, people are gods in embryo. Like, there's not the same distance between God and man that most religions put there. So there's room for gods all over the place, I guess. I guess. But it's still unclear to most Mormons who are used to the classical Trinity, the Godhead. They're used to the father, the son, and the holy ghost. And now you're telling us that there's the father, the son and Adam, you know, it's weird. And the apostles were not totally comfortable with it. Some of them never get on board. Most notably Orson Pratt who goes around and says, I don't know what Brigham's talking about. This essentially not true. And that leads to some, some, some pretty big conflicts between Orson Pratt and Brigham young. And finally in 1857, Brigham. Kind of Kind of admits the feet on the Adam God theory. He says, quote, whether Adam is the person that we should consider our heavenly father or not is considerable of a mystery to a good many. And, uh, that's as good as an apology as you ever get from Brigham young. uh, It's basically his way of saying, all right. right. I'm going to leave this alone. Um, It's a, it's a tough doctrine. He also teaches a new doctrine called blood atonement. Which is this idea that there are certain sins that are so grave, that the only way that you can ever be forgiven for them is by having your blood shed. So the example that would probably make most sense to the most people is murder. If you murder someone, the only way to get forgiveness for that is to yourself be killed. And so, you know, lots of people believe in capital punishment for murder, so, okay. Fine. People can buy into that.

Well, Well, actually, now that I say it out loud anyway, there are very few, if any examples of people abusing this and murdering adulterers in Utah, but what you do have is people who may be. Use it as an excuse when they already want to do someone harm. Anyway. Uh, much like Adam, God theory, blood atonement would not survive long. Brigham young was great at building institutions, building towns and cities and building businesses, but he was not great at. Building doctrines at. Establishing new ideas in a religious context. So the church, Jesus Christ of latter day saints has officially repudiated blood atonement. They did so all the way back in the 19th century. And then once again, in the 20th century. So. So. Um, those, but those, those are the two major attempts he makes it, uh, Doctrinal innovation. Uh, Throughout the early 1850s Brigham's family is rapidly expanding by 1858. He has a 47 children.

And he needs novel arrangements in order to manage a family of that size as you as you can, imagine. Right. I mean, I mean, that's a question I'll have, you will have is when you have that many wives in that many children, just like, how do you do life? So one way is that he builds two houses called the beehive house and the lion house. And these are very big houses. They still stand. Uh, Uh, they're still there in salt lake city. You can go take a tour of them and see what, what it was like. Uh, I recommend it. If you're in salt lake city, go to the lighthouse at school. And so he had, you know, some families, the wife of Brigham young would say, I can't live with all these women. And so he would say, okay, we'll figure out a situation for you. And they would get set up in an individual house for that wife, with her children. But other women, uh, found that lonely, right? To live. In a house, basically a single mother with no husband there. And so they liked this communal living arrangement of these big houses.

And so they had two big houses where you would have up to 12 wives with Brigham Young: their children living there. Family life is very complicated with that many wives. And, uh, uh, there were politics, conflicting personalities, jealousies, and all sorts of difficulties. Um, Um, one of the ways that Brigham managed it was. With this sort of military discipline, right? So there was family prayer at a very certain time. And he would send out the call and everyone had to be there. And, um, um, you know, you know, when you have that many children, you kind of have to be very. Efficient about things. You have to run things like an assembly line. And he would set budgets for each of his wives. It is, you know, you know, I guess I can't get too deep into it here, but it is interesting to read about. Um, How you manage that type of household. And the short answer is kind of you kind of manage it like a business. That's kind of how I kind think of it. Um, so it's complicated, but to be honest, It mostly works. And despite these complications, domestic life is mostly a source of joy for Brigham in his life. In the 1850s. At this time he establishes a company called the Brigham young express and carry company. It was often shortened to the Y X company, young express by X and it transports mail, freight and passengers from Missouri to California. Um, and obviously it makes a stop in Utah. So basically Mormon converts. Who were baptized either in the us or in England or other places in Europe. Uh, Uh, they had to make this journey. So in order to get there, They needed to be resupplied along the way. And they needed wagons and, and all this stuff. And so Brigham young things. I don't love that when these people are coming out to Utah. They're getting all this stuff. They're getting all these supplies from non-Mormons. I'd like to keep it all in the family. So to speak, like to be working, giving our money to each other. And helping build things up. So he builds this Y X company to transport people from Missouri to Utah. And help supply them so that. You know, You know, they're buying supplies from, from from, from Mormons. Instead of non-Mormons the company also gets a government contract to transport mail and deliveries, and the Y X company, um,", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/brigham-young", "title": "Brigham Young", "chunk_index": 56, "publication_date": "2022-09-09", "total_chunks_in_doc": 99}}

Instead of non - Mormons the company also gets a government contract to transport mail and deliveries , and the Y X company , um , Brigham Young: um, was quite successful. At least initially it was profitable. Did well for Brigham and did well for the saints, help them, uh, get across the Plains. uh, But so he's got all this stuff going on. And while his mind was so concerned with transporting people to Utah and getting them set up in these new towns and cities and, and getting them to, to live in economically viable towns, the religious aspects of life had really come to be neglected. So Brigham looks around and finds out that some of these towns are not even having church meetings. No church meetings in this explicitly religious kingdom, right? This, this community they're trying to set up. Uh, the people are, are so concerned with. Um, building their farms and getting food that they're literally not even having church. So Brigham is afraid that they're going to lose their way, lose sight of their unique mission. So he kicks off something called the Mormon reformation. Essentially Brigham young and as counselors and some of the apostles. Go round and they start giving these fiery sermons. They're calling people to, to repent. Uh, He's telling them you forgotten God. He encourages people not to drink alcohol, not to smoke tobacco. Uh, they encourage people to get rebaptized and recommit themselves to God. That's how bad things have gotten, you know, you're, you're you know, you're, baptized to wash away your sins. Well Well guess what. It's not going great. So you need to be baptized again. Uh, along with rebaptism they're encouraging plural marriage And the number of plural marriage is skyrockets at this time, at the time of the Mormon reformation. And this is beginning really in the fall of 1856, cause 1856 in 1857. And this is timely. It's good that he fortified the people's faith because he was about to deal with the most serious crisis of his tenure in Utah. War was about to come to his doorstep. The buildup to the Utah war starts early. They have the runaway judges of 1852, which we talked about, then they basically have friendly judges that are acquiescent and everything goes smoothly from 1853 to 1855. But 1955, there's a judge named William Drummond. Who's appointed to be the chief judge in Utah. uh, And, uh, he was not a good choice.

He leaves his wife back east and he comes out to Brigham Young: Utah. With a prostitute as his companion. Now, uh, you can probably imagine how this goes over with a highly religious people, uh, who are. Specifically in this area to be living out their religious commitments. Right. So Brigham young calls, Drummond, and this is publicly. Uh, quote, as a vein, as a peacock and as ignorant as a jackass. So things get off to a great start. Uh, Uh, then there's an incident where apparently Drummond assaults a man. So, uh, So, uh, the Mormons are threatening to prosecute him in local courts and throw them in jail. So Drummond runs back to Washington, DC and starts telling everyone who will listen about this dangerous theocracy that Brigham young is running out in Utah. He's telling everyone that he's the defacto Monarch, he's the king of the territory. Which sounds scary and is honestly kind of true. kind of Uh, and obviously at this point, he's not the only one telling me stories. There are other runaway judges and there are other officials who had bad experiences in Utah and had access to grind. So a opinions in Washington and on the east coast are not a. We're not very favorable. So the Mormons at the moment. And then there's an election in 1856. In an 1857, James Buchanan becomes president of the United States and Brigham young sends him a letter. It sends him a bad letter. He does a bad job. I think Brigham has managed to run so many judges out of Utah. For so long that he's confident in himself, maybe a little overconfident She doesn't like, okay. What are they going to do to me? Right. I'm in control here. So, uh, I'm gonna tell them how it really is. So he sends his letter to James Buchanan. He essentially says, you know, you know, congrats on the election, blah, blah, blah. Um, by the way, can you stop sending these corrupt judges? Anyone who comes out here who's corrupt will be severely punished and sent back to you. So, um, So, um, let's just cut to the chase and why don't you send us some good judges? And also by the way, can you stop stationing soldiers out here?

We don ' t like these soldiers and I don ' t think you have the authority to do it . So cut it Brigham Young: out. And so it seems like he's flouting the authority of the federal government and in a way he is. So the beginning administration starts to get concerned from this letter and they start asking around Washington. Like Like okay. What's going on with these Mormons. And, uh, uh, well, well, who are the people who know anything about the Mormons who has been out to Utah? It's all these runaway judges and officials, and boy, did they have some things to say about Brigham young? So James Buchanan and his administration hear all these things and he convinces himself that Utah is in a state of rebellion. He gets a bill through Congress that authorizes the creation of an army of two and a half thousand soldiers to go escort a new territorial governor to Utah, to replace Brigham young and enforce federal rule. When Brigham hears this. He sends the territory into a state of emergency. At first he's defiant. He says they kicked us out of Ohio. They kicked us out of Missouri. They kicked us out of Illinois. They cannot move us from here. We have nowhere left to go. We're going to stay and fight. And I think you can see his point, right? Like how many times are we gonna have to do this? Like, Like, we can't just kind of keep running every time at a certain point, you kind of gotta draw a line in the sand. And so they implement some emergency measures. They form a militia start trying to recruit native American allies and cease all commerce with non-Mormons and they make the decision that okay. We probably can't fight these people. It's literally the U S government. We don't have enough men to fight them. Uh, standing army to stand the army. Uh, two and a half thousand soldiers, which by the way, would eventually swelled to over 5,000 soldiers. A full third of the entire us army. And, uh, and they can't beat that even if they could have beat that. That would just provoke an even larger response from the us government. So instead they decide to try to stall and delay this army. They're going to burn grasslands so that the Army's horses and oxen don't have anything to eat. They're going to harass their supply trains and destroy their supplies. And if that doesn't work. Brigham commits to the Russia strategy, right?

I shall lay my dwelling houses in ashes. I shall lay my meals and ashes. I shall cut every shrub and tree in the valley, every pole, every inch of board and put it all into ashes. I'll make a Potter's field of every canyon they go into. So in other words, he's saying, if you guys come here. There's going to be nothing for you to take control of. We're going to start by making it impossible for you to come out here with, with all of our harassment and these, these kind of lightening strikes to take out your supply trains. But if you do make it out here, you're going to take command of a pile of rebel and that's it. Uh, Uh, this kicks off of very bad time in terms of relations between Mormons and non-Mormons in Utah. It was mostly Mormons, but there were some non-Mormons uh, and, uh, in one instance there's a wagon train of people bound for California called the Fancher baker train they're from Arkansas. And of course, if you're traveling from Arkansas to California, you're expecting to be able to resupply along the way. And, um, um, You know, You know, Utah's been here for a decade now and they're expecting to be able to resupply in Utah. And all of a sudden. You know, You know, they didn't have anything to do with this Utah war. They are finding that none of these Mormons will trade with them. I don't give them any supplies. And so that's. You know, not only bad, but like kind of kind of dangerous for them. And so they start coralling with local Mormons, we start insulting them. And things escalate a few Mormons attack them. Essentially form a little militia and they kill a couple of them. So the Fancher baker train circles up. In this valley called mountain Meadows and the local Mormons, trying to decide. Okay. What do we do? We attack these people. That's probably rash. Uh, but we killed a few of them. If we let them go, they're going to tell the Californians.

So what do we do? They write to Brigham young, they ask him what they should do. And before Brigham Young's response can come, they decide. Uh, Uh, to take matters into their own hands. They say, all right, here's what we're going to do. We're going to mask her, everyone. And we're going to blame it on the Paiute Indians. And so on September 11th, 1857. Uh, it's known as the mountain Meadows massacre. And I'm awful. They kill over 120 people. Um, coming to a flag of peace and say, Hey, we're going to escort you out of here. And then, uh, on a certain signal, they turn and, uh, all these, uh, all these, all these Mormon guys holding guns, shoot people at point blank range and massacre them. Um, Um, Yeah. So that's the mountain Meadows massacre. It's a, it's one of the ugliest moments in. Mormon and Utah history. Um, Um, as things like this are happening. Uh, the army is inching closer and closer. The Mormons do manage to slow them down with this policy of attacking supplies and burning grasslands. uh, and they're making them go slower. But they are going to make it right. Eventually the army is going to make it. And so Brigham says, okay, his first inclination is to say, we're gonna, we're gonna fight this thing. So he sets a certain line in a canyon near salt lake city. And he gives secret instructions says if the army insists on coming. Once they cross this line. Let guerrilla war commence. You know, You know, we're going to put men in the canyons and we're gonna start picking off soldiers uh, from up in these canyons uh, with snipers. But luckily for him. Snow storms start early that year. And in November it forces the army to stop right before they reached that line where hostilities would have commenced. And frankly, this is horrible management by Brigham. It was a, not a good decision. If they had started firing. They started killing soldiers.

But luckily uh, he's, uh, he's saved by God or fate or good luck because the us army stops right in time. And so they decided to winter just outside of salt lake city. And basically say in the spring, we're coming for you, we're coming into salt lake city. kind of a So it was kind of a showdown over the winter. Everyone's just holding their breath to see what's going to happen. And despite all this, despite the overwhelming show of force, right on his doorstep, Brigham young is still not backing down. You know, You know, people talk about. Vision and the importance of vision. I've talked about it. I made the point in the Steve jobs episode that we were able to see apple. With Steve Wazniak and without Steve jobs. So with, you know, you know, a technical genius and without the visionary. And then we were able to see apple with Steve jobs without Steve Wozniak, with the visionary. And without the technical genius. And the apple, Steve jobs was much more successful. And the lesson to me was vision is the most important thing. How can it be that valuable? Right. I mean, it's the easiest thing in the world to have a vision. You know, how easy is it to say we're going to build insanely great products. Um, and then how difficult is it to actually build those insanely great products? Right. Right. Uh, Uh, so it seems like. like. Vision is. Much easier than engineering. So how's it that valuable? Well, Well, Th these visionaries are insanely committed to the principles that undergird their vision. They refuse to compromise when any sane person would compromise. You see this all the time with Steve jobs and you see it here with Brigham young. Any sane person. What did you sacrifice? Some of you taught us independence and submitted to the federal troops. But not Brigham young uh, who was. You know, Crazy about this vision of an independent kingdom of God. But once you're going to do. Um, There are no, it seems like there's no good decisions left.

So he hears about this and he's a reputable, upstanding non-Mormon. So he goes to president Buchanan And says, Hey, you know, Let me, uh, let me go negotiate for you. Let me, let me go resolve this conflict. And I guess the other thing to mention is that as they winter they're in Utah, just outside of salt lake city, this army, all of a sudden becomes very unpopular in, in the United States because there's a giant depression. Whereas there's a big economic recession in the United States. And so all of a sudden, you know, you know, what had been popular like, because everyone's like, sure, go, go kick around the Mormons. No one likes them. Polygamy they're weirdos. Uh, Uh, none of us liked them, but all of a sudden it's like, okay, When times were good, we were fine sending out this army, but now. That there's economic hardship. We're spending a lot of money. To send out this army and for what. The Mormons. That they're supposedly in rebellion. Like no one really believes that. kind of And so it's kind of embarrassing. Um, that began. It has this army all the way out in Utah doing who knows what. So he's looking for a way out. uh, And, uh, so this guy, Thomas Cain shows up and says, Hey, I can negotiate a peace. I know these guys give me a letter from you from the president saying that I'm coming out to negotiate and that I have your full faith and confidence. So president Buchanan says, sure. Here's your letter. You have my full confidence. Good luck. So Thomas King takes his letter, goes to the Mormons. Goes to the army and starts trying to negotiate with everyone. And he comes up with this very, very clever ruse, which is he decides to divide the army. Because the army, remember they're escorting the governor. To take command of Utah right now, the governor.

So that's his priority, but the general of the army is really looking to score a military victory. So he doesn't care. He He he'd rather invade salt lake city and shoot some Mormons and send them scattering, you know? That would be a disaster for the governor, but for the general, that's a great outcome. So Thomas Cain starts to pick up on these differences and he starts to exploit them. Um, And he does this by. Uh, first creating a fake division within the Mormons. He says, Hey guys, I need you to play along with this ruse. I'm going to create a Hawk camp and a dove camp. I'm going to say that there actually were some Mormons who were really hawkish, who wanted war with the government, but actually there was also an internal peace party. In fact, Brigham young. He's the head of the peace party. Okay, and this is completely opposite of the truth. Brigham young was the most belligerent one who was pushing for and giving instructions to escalate the war. But it's a clever ruse. And so while the army is still wintering in the Fort outside of salt lake city, Um, he sets up these, these fake camps. And then he tells the governor. You know, You know, you really just gotta come into salt lake city and meet this Brigham young guy. He's the head of the peace party. He's always wanted peace. He's always been okay with you taking over as governor. Just come meet him. See how it goes. And so the guy comes into salt lake city. Bringing it on meets him and realizes this guy's really nice and not very bright. , uh, and that's kind of an ideal combination for Brigham young. He realizes I can control this guy. Uh, Uh, he can be my surrogate governor. This is going to be fine. If this guy becomes governor. Mm. And so of course he winds him, Dines him, you know, charms him, says, you know, this is all a big misunderstanding. We can't wait for you to be governor. It's going to be fine.

Some Mormons hate Brigham young in consequence, perhaps of his Pacific measures. Are these like, He's writing back to the federal government. Like, Like, can you believe this man? Brigham young. He's so great to work with. He he's He he's he's so in favor of peace that some Mormons are mad at him for you to be so peaceful, they can't stand them. So, uh, So, uh, this governor coming is like, like, this is great Brigham young. I love you. It turns around to the army guys. I don't really need you. I'm fine. And, uh, the general in the army is furious. He still vows to come into salt lake city. And, uh, as a consequence on April 1st, Mormon start evacuating salt lake city and moving just south to Provo, which is like 40 miles south of where I live now, basically. And this isn't the scorched earth policy that Brigham young had threatened. But it's kinda, you know, It's him putting his finger on the trigger saying, I'll do it. Look I'm serious. I'll do it. I'm moving people already. I know we're just down the road, but we're starting to move. And this is enough to panic coming and incentivize everyone to come to an agreement. And so they send some letters to the federal government, president Buchanan, the grease terms, which are blanket amnesty for everyone. Brigham young is not going to be prosecuted for treason or for polygamy. And neither are any of the other senior Mormon leaders. Um, and in return, the Mormons will accept the new governor, but otherwise life goes on Brigham's kingdom of God will continue forward with no major changes. And so this is an interesting outcome because on the one hand, the Utah war is a victory because Brigham Young's not prosecuted. Other church leaders are not prosecuted. Things get to keep going as they were, which is really the main thing that they wanted. Um, but at the same time, it's a defeat because the whole reason for the war was Brigham young said.

Uh, a technical failure, you know, technically he loses the Utah war. Uh, And it's just one of many failures. Uh, mean, Uh, he has a lot, I mean, you look at Adam God doctrine failure. Uh, blood atonement, arguably a failure. He tries to establish a bunch of cash crops out in Utah. Uh, tobacco cotton. He tries to do iron mining. All those industries fail. He tries to create a new phonetic alphabet. Uh, for, for immigrants to understand English better, that never takes hold that fails. The Utah war is a failure. Later he tries to create these communitarian organizations called the United order. Those all fail his business. The Y X company fails during the Utah war when the government cancels all of his mail contracts. So it's like failure, failure, failure, failure, failure, failure, failure. And yet through all this failure, Utah slowly growing into exactly what he wanted a kingdom obedient to him, organized along the principles of Mormon doctrine. That is largely independent of outside influence. There's this great saying by Winston Churchill, which is success is going from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm. And you really see that with Brigham young. like each tactical battle is a failure. And yet, because he's just so tenacious, always trying new things and because he's always so focused on the overall vision, he's achieving strategic success despite. Tactical failure after tactical failure. It reminds me a lot of Walt Disney. Who had this huge hit with snow white. And then a string of disappointments. That went on for decades. Uh, and yet he was achieving magnificent success despite this growing Disney into one of the most valuable companies in the world and eventually building Disneyland. Um, Um, and so you, you see this common pattern where you keep your eyes on the, on the vision. You never compromise it and you persist forward with no loss of enthusiasm. And you can still succeed, even if it seems like at each step you're, you're encountering these setbacks in these failures. um, But, um, but look, obviously it's not all failures, right?

And an area that attracts quite a bit of commerce as a halfway stop between the Eastern us and California. By 1867 when Brigham young takes a tour of his kingdom.

But to me, one thing that is symbolic is that in 1862, Just 15 years after they first arrive in the valley. They completed the salt lake feeder and you can go look it up. It's not standing anymore. Um, They tore it down sometime mid 20th century, but it was a good theater. A wouldn't be out of place in like like a smaller European city or something. He had multiple balconies, beautiful columns out front, it seeded 1500 people. that's, And that's, that's wild to me that it took 15 years. To go from dust. And, and Trubs. uh, To uh, to decent luxury, Like a right? Like a decently nice leader. And that to me is amazing.

{"text": ", you know , it being a time when people can build cities again , to me , this shows how much you can accomplish in a very short amount of time . You don ' t have to resign yourself to just planting the seeds that will someday grow Brigham Young: into something. Cool. No, within your lifetime, you can build an amazing city. And this demonstrates that. Uh, Uh, another example of this is in 1867. They complete the salt lake tabernacle. Uh, Uh, a large religious hall where they could have big meetings. And actually when they complete it in 1867 is the largest assembly hall in the United States. Okay. It seats 7,000 people. And that's just amazing for me to think about. Like. They didn't have assembly halls that big in New York, in Boston, in Philadelphia. No. This place that had only been settled. 20 years previously. Now has the largest assembly hall in the United States. So, um, You know, that You know, that that shows what you can do. Another threat emerged to their independence in 1869. Maybe not as dire as the Utah war, but 1969 is when the transcontinental railroad was completed. Uh, if you don't know the history, they start building the railroad in the east and in the west, and they kind of kind of build towards the middle. And the place where they eventually meet is in Utah, near current day augment just north of salt lake city. I don't know. 60 miles or something like that. And the Mormons are integral in helping to build the last portion of the railroad as it draws near completion. So this is an economic boom. Firstly, because Mormons are paid to construct the actual railroad. But secondly, because all of a sudden you have this strong economic link to the rest of the United States. So it provides an economic boom, but it also means that Mormons are no longer an isolated people. Brigham young would never, after the construction of the railroad. Uh, Uh, have the level of absolute control that he had before it was completed. And I don't want to exaggerate this. He was still indisputably, the wealthiest and most powerful man in Utah. By leaps and bounds. It wasn't close, but he can't demand obedience in the same way anymore. One sign that Brigham young was losing his grasp a little bit from where it was, uh, or perhaps loosening his grasp was, uh, this group of people called the God beets. So this guy, William Gabi and his friend Elias Harrison go to the east coast. And they discover seances what was called spiritual wisdom.

Uh , so like , you know , seances think of a hokey lady with a turban Brigham Young: on her head. Uh, you know, Uh, you know, looking into a crystal ball or, you know, saying, oh, I can feel a spirit with us now. Um, That, uh, and it was very popular at the time in the United States. uh, So you think about it. At this time, all these people had just died in the civil war. And this meant immense suffering. And a lot of people who missed their, their brothers, their sons, their fathers. And wanted to connect with them somehow. And so you have these seances. you know, And these people saying, you know, I can receive a message for you from your dead brother. And this sounds ridiculous to us now. Um, you know, you know, seances or I think most people consider them pretty hokey. Uh, But at the time it was very popular and very kind honestly like kind of high society kind of progressive. It was a little bit like, uh, like yoga is now right. Like, Like, yeah. People rolled their eyes a little bit. kind of It was kind of woo. But at the same time, It was for the educated class. It was seen as, as smart and progressive and something that modern people did. And so this guy, God, be. He comes back. He's a member of the Mormon church. You know, he's a very successful businessman, very wealthy. He discovered spiritual wisdom and he brings it back and starts this church, essentially a new church. They still claim to be Mormons at first. And then, uh, after not very long and they kind of dropped that pretense and they start something called the liberal Institute. Which was a sort of philosophical society is what you might call it, uh, in, in this place where they can practice. Say Hans's. And they start a newspaper called the salt lake Tribune. Which, um, um, was an anti-Mormon newspaper was Utah's preeminent primary anti-Mormon newspaper actually still is Utah's primary anti-Mormon newspaper. And, um, the fact that Brigham young. You know, it it doesn't violently drive these people out, lets them start this newspaper. Um, Kind of shows how much things have changed, you know? you know? For sure.

{"text": "this newspaper . Um , Kind of shows how much things have changed , you know ? you know ? For sure . A decade previously , he would have intimidated them . Um , Put pressure on them to leave , to get out of Dodge . And so Brigham Young: now you see Brigham adapting a little bit to a new normal. And I think for the first time showing some semblance of compromise. And I think part of that is because. He now felt very secure. He had accomplished what he wanted to this, this kingdom that he had built was independent. Was religious was following his principles. And so for the first time, he feels a little comfortable loosening the reigns a little bit, and maybe also recognizes that with the railroad. He just doesn't have the same leeway. To demand obedience that he had before. But this doesn't mean that Brigham has fully given himself over to openness and cooperation. Um, one way that he copes with this new outside influence is to create incentives and opportunities for Mormons interact commercially. So once again, he's saying, Hey. We need to boycott non-Mormon businesses and only do business with each other. So we established something called Zion's cooperative mercantile institution. It's basically a cartel of Mormon merchants. And he gets people to buy into this and says, Hey. Um, Mormon citizens. I'm going to ask you to do commerce as much as possible with other Mormons and Maura and merchants. I'm going to ask you to lower your margins a little bit. But we're going to make it up to you on volume because all these Mormons and Utah's vast majority Mormon at this time, they're all going to be coming to your business to buy their supplies. uh, And this is a hugely expensive endeavor for the church. It's a big gamble, but it pays off. So you see my becomes profitable relatively quickly and stays profitable for a long time. It actually only closed its doors in 2002. So, you know, So, you know, 150 years CCMI was going. And it also achieves his other goal of driving a bunch of non-Mormons out of business and does manage to sort strengthen the church while weakening outside business influences. But, you know, this is actually kind of the opposite. What I was talking about before. kind of This is a tactical victory in what was a larger strategic Titlewave that he couldn't stop. Yeah, he drives some merchants out of business in Utah. Uh, Uh, some non-Mormon merchants, but, uh, overall.

Uh , economic life was becoming more integrated with the rest of the United States and less self - sufficient than it was before . The 1870s are the final decade of Brigham Young's life. He grows a little less active in this decade. Remember, he was born in 1801. So he's in his seventies. He's lived a hard life. The years have taken their toll on him. He's got kidney issues, urinary issues, digestive issues, hemorrhoids . Rheumatism. He's getting a little fat. Even, so, you know, even in the so, you know, 1870s, he's still fairly energetic. There's a story that, that I love that I read in one of these books where, uh, his son Brigham Jr. Is on a trip with him. Uh, in 1870. So he's he's 70 years old. Or a 69 years old Uh, he's and they're visiting a Southern settlement. And everyone must've drunk, some bad water or something like that because everyone starts getting sick at the same time. You know, They're with. Like with 10 or 12 people or so. All these guys are throwing up at the same time. And Brigham young junior says the same feeling comes upon him. Like he wanted to throw up and he's kinda got his head between his legs. Uh, but he writes quote, father sat there and shook his fist at me and I managed to choke it down. And then he says that his father, that, quote. Fought off the feeling produced as medicine and was very active in treating the sick. So I love that image of, you know, you know, all these people throwing up in Brigham young junior, just wanting to throw up so bad and looking at his father, who's literally shaking his fist at him and saying, no son, you're not going to throw up. Well, you're gonna choke it down and we are going to help the people who are throwing up. Throughout the 1870s, more of as time gets taken up, fighting legal battles. Uh, both from people who are trying to prosecute the church for the practice of plural marriage, the practice of polygamy. And also during the 1870s, people try and connect Brigham young to the mountain Meadows massacre.

Uh, Uh, in Nauvoo and they had started building one in salt lake city. Um, but Brigham Young's vision for that was, was, was very large, very granted. So it wouldn't be completed for. Uh, Uh, a number of years after he died. But he does get to dedicate this temple in St. George, which is in Southern Utah. It's a much smaller city than salt lake city. Um, Um, and they had started construction on a correspondingly smaller temple. So it was finished. So Brigham goes down and dedicates it in 1877. It's a very happy occasion. Um, People are celebratory and then Brigham young comes in and gives us thundering speech. You know, Uh, It says you need to repent. We need to do better. Congrats on finishing the temple, but. Come on. Step it up. People. Um, And I think it's interesting to see how much. Things have changed. Like the St. George temple was celebratory. But it wasn't this spiritual Pentecost that the dedication of the Navu temple was. And I think that tells you how the emphasis had shifted. From a religion that was primarily focused on. Ecstatic religious experiences. In a, in Illinois. To now a religion that was more focused, frankly, on building a physical community, building this kingdom. the, Th the, the primary experience of Mormonism had changed. And as you look at it, things like speaking in tongues, miraculous healings, prophecies. Uh, exorcisms, all the stuff had a, it wasn't gone by any means. Like all this stuff still happened in Utah. But it definitely didn't happen as often as it did when Jill Smith was in charge. So, um, Brigham young was trying to follow that same vision. But he did emphasize more the physical building of an actual community. Uh, Uh, then he did these sort of. Uh, Uh, spiritual experiences.

It has said that his last coherent words were. Joseph Joseph Joseph. Josephs. This is someone who till the very end, loved Joseph Smith and still had him on his mind as he was dying. He was a man of vision I'm, and that vision still possessed him in his final moments. I'm, I'm touched by that. Joseph, Joseph, The very last things that he said are very well recorded. Uh, he was given a blessing by his son and at the end of the blessing, he muttered. Amen. And then he, he slipped out of consciousness for awhile. he, Uh, woke up. And said that's all right. Shortly thereafter, he fell asleep again. And then a little bit after that stopped breathing. And so ended the life of Brigham young. So, um, so what do we learn from him? Uh, the first thing is to be irrational, unreasonable, intractable, intransigent, uh, completely insane. When it comes to your vision. You know, You know, that describes Steve jobs, Walt Disney, Thomas Edison, and it also describes Brigham young. They insisted on perfection. You know, You know, you think of Brigham young there with the weight of the U S army on his doorstep, ready to kick him out. And, uh, uh, What does he do? He resists. He says, You know, when we're going to, You know, we're going to continue as an independent kingdom, no matter what. And so you have to keep that in mind. If, if you're going to be the visionary, if you're gonna be the leader, you have to be willing to be unreasonable. In your commitment to your vision and to your values. Uh, you know, Uh, other stuff we can learn from Brigham, you know, all the normal stuff. Uh, he was a man of immense energy. Uh, I think part of that energy came from the fact that he loved what he was doing so much. He loved what he was building. It consumed him, all his thoughts and energy.

Could, could hopefully. you know, raise the level of their ambition as well. And, you know, I guess some last reflections, Brigham young. Literally kind of carved his likeness into the American landscape. Um, but both physically with, with how he organized these cities and towns also into the genetics of America. You know, He's kind of the Gangas Kahn of America. He has more than 30,000 people descended from him, including me. Including Steve young, the great American football player, Orson Scott card, the very famous science fiction author. Uh, and another very successful notable people. Not that I'm very successful notable, but you know what I mean? It's a very impressive legacy to leave. Genetically he's one of the most successful humans of all time. And I guess just, um, to end, the last thing I wanna leave you with is just to talk one more time about the size of his vision. Uh, there's a quote I love from the architect, Daniel Burnham. And he said, Make no small plans. They have no magic to stir men's blood and probably will not themselves be realized. Make big plans, aim high and hope and work. Remembering that a noble logical diagram once recorded will never die belong after we are gone. I will be a living thing asserting itself with ever-growing insistency.

We didn't even touch on his interactions with native Americans, his attitudes and policies towards slavery, and African-Americans his propensity to curse from the pulpit establishment of, of BYU and Deseret university later, the university of Utah.

I reached out to John Turner. Who's a biographer of Brigham young and asked him if he'd be willing to come on the show because I thought it would be fun and interesting to get an outside perspective. Talk to someone who's really an expert. I can get into some of those details about his life. In this conversation, we talk a lot of big picture about Brigham Young's impact and legacy. And of course, we also talk about some of those attributes that made him so special. What made Brigham young, Brigham young, what made him such a great leader and able to hold this group of people together and establish such a interesting. And dynamic legacy. So I hope it's interesting to you, to be honest, it's a little bit. Context heavy. If you don't know anything about Brigham young, other than what you've heard in the podcast, it might be a little tough to follow, but I don't know. Maybe I'm not giving myself enough credit. Uh, if you are one of those people who doesn't have a lot of context and you listened to this, Let me know what you think and if you're able to follow it.

I'm here with, uh, Dr. John Turner so, uh, I've done this series on Brigham Young you know, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a fan, I'm an enthusiast. I like learning about him, but I thought, uh, it'd be nice to talk to an expert who would set me straight and, uh, really, really tell me what's what and what happened. how-to-take-over-the_brigham-young-end-notes_ben_wilson-kel3j12t8_cfr_2022-oct-21-1802pm-utc-riverside: My, my first question is, is about the impact of Brigham Young, First glance, you think, okay, wow. This is someone who had a massive impact on the world, on the United States. Someone who led tens of thousands of people across the continental United States, settled Intermountain West, you know, Utah, Idaho, many parts of Arizona, Wyoming, into Canada, into Mexico, , you know, religious impact. how-to-take-over-the_brigham-young-end-notes_ben_wilson-kel3j12t8_cfr_2022-oct-21-1802pm-utc-riverside: But, but then you start thinking about another way and you say, okay, well, people who were not Mormons didn't have that much trouble settling Colorado, Washington, Oregon. , so my question is really, , let, let's try and do a counterfactual in which Brigham Young doesn't leave the church, maybe Hebrew Kimble does or something like that. how-to-take-over-the_brigham-young-end-notes_ben_wilson-kel3j12t8_cfr_2022-oct-21-1802pm-utc-riverside: h how different would things be really?

They simply had a different approach to settling the Brigham Young: West than most other Americans. Most other Americans wanted to move to, you know, somewhere, say the Great Basin, extract resources from it and get out and, or they might have settled on parts of the planes where they would be mini miles from their neighbors, you know, sort of living in isolation. The Mormons under Brigham Young's leadership, they just had a totally different model. They built these tight-knit communities in which, you know, people lived near each other and had their lives organized to, to at least some extent around, uh, church activity and then the string of settlements. That sort of, as you suggested in your question, Extended north from, you know, the great Salt Lake up into Idaho, extended south and southwest. Uh, as far as San Bernard Bernardino. So, , I mean, just the, the shape, you know, the, the landscape that you would drive through today would look a lot different if other Americans, , had settled the Great Basin in it. You know, you might not notice that as much today if you're driving through the sprawl around Provo and Orum or up in Salt Lake. But just that predictable string of settlements of people coming from the long haul for the long haul of people showing up from places like Wales and Scandinavia. Certainly in the 19th century, the character of these places was really different than it would've been without Brigham Young and his. how-to-take-over-the_brigham-young-end-notes_ben_wilson-kel3j12t8_cfr_2022-oct-21-1802pm-utc-riverside: One of the other questions, I guess I have kind of the same question, but from a religious perspective. , when I look at it, , you look essentially at, , Sidney Rigdon and the movement, he led in it fairly quickly. I almost think of it as like gravitational pull, right? And it got pulled, sort of unfolded back into pretty mainstream Protestant Christianity. how-to-take-over-the_brigham-young-end-notes_ben_wilson-kel3j12t8_cfr_2022-oct-21-1802pm-utc-riverside: Uh, you look at the. Reformed Church of Jesus Christ of, of latter des, latter des Saints. And the, the process took longer.

So, is Brigham like a singular personality that is responsible, for the church of Jesus Christ, kind of Latter Day Saints remaining distinct from Protestant Christianity? , or are there others who could have led it down the road? how-to-take-over-the_brigham-young-end-notes_ben_wilson-kel3j12t8_cfr_2022-oct-21-1802pm-utc-riverside: It has gone down. That's a great question as well. So first of all, you know, I think a lot of people, if they didn't know the details of the history, they would presume that Brigham Young became Joseph Smith's primary successor. You mentioned some of the other directions that different people went, but his primary successor because of just his innate qualities as a leader or, um, the nature of his bid for leadership after Joseph Smith's death. But a lot of it was happenstance. He was two weeks older than Hebrew c Kimball, which is why he was president of the Quorum of the 12 Apostle. So, you know, it's sort of sheer. Circumstance at our happenstance that to a certain extent that he ends up as the one in charge. I think the fact that Young or Kimball, or Woodruff or Parley Pratt, , that the quorum of the 12 Apostles under Brigham's leadership, under their leadership, that it was they who took the saints, uh, across the plains over the mountains into the Great Basin, certainly had a huge impact on the trajectory of, , the churches and the Utah Territories relationship with the US government over the course of the 19th century, you know, other, potential leaders. Certainly Rigdon or, uh, the reorganization that began in the 1860s, they would not have had the same, you know, hostile, mutually hostile relationship with the US government.

Um, but on the other hand, , I mean the church was ambivalent. Uh, there was a reason that they were going so far out and it was kind of to get beyond the reach of the US government and, for all their, uh, for all of the, well, I think is overblown blustering about, uh, the latter of saints, , being violent. how-to-take-over-the_brigham-young-end-notes_ben_wilson-kel3j12t8_cfr_2022-oct-21-1802pm-utc-riverside: So, uh, wishing harm on the United States, uh, it was a theocracy in that complaint. , on, on a certain level was accurate. Wasn. Abso no. Sure. So there's a lot to unpack there. So this is a relationship that develops over time and before Brigham Young is in charge. So you know, under. Joseph Smith's leadership. The Saints are, uh, expelled from Missouri at the pain of extermination. Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, other church leaders, church members more generally. They're really embittered that no one will grant them redress for what they have repeatedly suffered in Missouri. They've lost their property. They've been, beaten up. Their women have been raped, and neither the state government of Missouri or , Congress or the President, nobody's doing anything to help them. And then the cycle, you know, not, it's not an exact similarity, but the cycle essentially repeats in Illinois. And Joseph Smith and his brother Hiam are murdered. No one ultimately is brought to justice for those murders. And so, yeah, there's a tremendous amount of estrangement from, uh, the US government and Young is very explicit. You know, he wants to lead the church to a place where there aren't other white people and so that they can govern themselves. And so then going forward, of course, there's a lot of mutual hostility and a lot of accusations thrown around on, on both sides. And the US government objects to the fact that, uh, the Utah territory is essentially run as a theocracy.

But you mentioned Hiram. And, and the last kinda counterfactual I wanted to ask you was, Hiram is an interesting character in that he seems, , naturally more conservative, small c conservative. , and yet he did practice plural marriage. how-to-take-over-the_brigham-young-end-notes_ben_wilson-kel3j12t8_cfr_2022-oct-21-1802pm-utc-riverside: Uh, Joseph, , kind of brought him into the inner circle, , carefully and after the apostles, but did bring him in. And I, he was the obvious successor if he hadn't died, if Joseph Smith had died and he had not, Do you have a feel for what direction the church would've gone if Hiram had survived? So, you know, historians generally don't like counterfactuals, but I'm how-to-take-over-the_brigham-young-end-notes_ben_wilson-kel3j12t8_cfr_2022-oct-21-1802pm-utc-riverside: Sorry. Sorry. I've given you like four You know, I, you know, one thing that occurs to me that, you know, I've, I've thought a little bit about Hirum recently because I've been doing some additional. research and thinking about Joseph Smith, and it's noteworthy to me that, you know, in June of 1844 when Joseph convened the Nav City Council to respond to the publication of the nav expository, which is this dissident newspaper just sharply critical of Joseph's leadership, Hiram is super forceful. You know, he calls for the press to be scattered and burned in the street. And so he certainly matches, , his brother's sort of fiery forceful response, maybe reckless response at that time. And so I agree that in a general sense, HIRA might seem like a bit more of a cautious individual. Than, , St. Joseph or Brigham.

So Brigham took his time examining the Book of Mormon before converting and being Brigham Young: baptized, and at least took a little bit of time contemplating plural marriage. But both of them, you know, once they're in, they're sort of all in. And so I'm sure in the finer points, leadership might have been different, but in terms of broad trajectory, I see, I see a lot of similarity. how-to-take-over-the_brigham-young-end-notes_ben_wilson-kel3j12t8_cfr_2022-oct-21-1802pm-utc-riverside: Okay. Done with the counterfactuals, I promise. One of the things that I loved about your book, and maybe I hadn't realized as much, is the depth of the relationship between Brigham Young and Hebrew Kimball, which I found very touching, , I guess he, he's someone who's considered, I guess, more of a minor player, uh, in the, in the early latter days state movement. Uh, although I think, , I, I again was struck reading your book that, he, he definitely played a, a larger role than, than I had previously given him credit for. Is there anyone else like that, that is generally regarded as a minor player, that in your research you have, have discovered that maybe they, uh, are, are a larger character. That is a great question. I mean, Heber Kimball is a good example and I think he, you know, he's partly overlooked because he's a bit less of a force by the time they get to Utah and the years pass. I think he doesn't find himself, you know, quite as much in the inner circle, uh eventually, and, you know, maybe feels a little bit adrift, because of that. I guess another figure that I would say, I don't know if overlooked is the right term, but someone else who comes to mind is William Clayton, who's a confidant, scribe, and clerk, for Joseph Smith. And is very close to events as they unfold in 18 43, 18 44 in na vu. And then also really doesn't find himself in Brigham Young's inner circle, , once they leave na vu and, you know, perhaps gets a bit less recognition because of that. William W.

There are this sort of interesting, cadre of people who become disaffected and then come back on their way to Utah. And, um, their relationship is, is very interesting, because, , like WW Phelps, it's people who very much have been in just Smith's inner circle, have been very close to him. how-to-take-over-the_brigham-young-end-notes_ben_wilson-kel3j12t8_cfr_2022-oct-21-1802pm-utc-riverside: And, they, they do still hold this, almost like talismanic energy that people find them really important symbolically, but have no actual control once they get to Utah. Yeah. Phelps also points to a bit of a difference in personality and leadership between, Joseph and Brigham. So Phelps is disaffected in Missouri, along with Orson Hyde and Joseph Smith, more or less, you know, welcomes them back into the fold. , by the time that Joseph Smith. is running for president in 1844, writing political figures the previous year. You know, Phelps is very important. You know, he does a lot of writing for Joseph Smith. , he's essentially Smith's ghost writer, , much of the time. And, you know, so that, you know, they could really patch things up. I think Brigham, if someone betrayed him, he might let him back into the fold, but he wouldn't let him forget it. He was, he was a little bit more, he's just a little bit more careful. how-to-take-over-the_brigham-young-end-notes_ben_wilson-kel3j12t8_cfr_2022-oct-21-1802pm-utc-riverside: Yeah, that's right.

Because he, he adored him so much. , can you speak a little more to the difference in leadership styles between Joseph and Brigham? Well, another time where he sort of criticizes Joseph is he says that, you know, Joseph was way too easy on dissent within the church. And you know, he's saying this being scarred by the wake of what has happened in nav, which I think was simply deeply traumatic, uh, for Brigham Young, both Joseph and Hirums murders, but also then living under the. Threat of the community's collapse or his own possible assassination. And so he wants to take a much harsher stance against dis dissent, which he sees as a grave danger to the church's survival. So that's also, you know, I think is a bit of a, of a difference in approach. I, I think some, oftentimes people, you know, other people have of course noticed that and talked about it, but I do think it has to be put in the context of what's happened in Missouri and na vu and Brigham Young is simply determined that's not going to happen. how-to-take-over-the_brigham-young-end-notes_ben_wilson-kel3j12t8_cfr_2022-oct-21-1802pm-utc-riverside: You've brought something up.

And so it's like, how do you swear these two things, this, the, on the one hand he can be fiercely critical and, uh, almost like a bull in a China shop. And on the other hand, he can be extremely diplomatic and really making sure to accommodate other people's feelings as he goes forward. Well, I suppose the simple answer would be that he would do what he thought the particular moment required. Now, I do think sometimes he did simply treat people with cruelty when it totally was not required. But, but, you know, the examples that you bring up are, are good ones. So when he, I think people for forget, because they typically. Think of Joseph as the spiritual leader and Brigham as the organizer. That that is too, stark of a contrast. I mean, Brigham Young would not have been able to successfully lead the church upon Joseph's death if large numbers of the Saints did not have a strong sense of spiritual loyalty to him. A lot of that was due to his leadership, , during the, , mission of the 12, to England, Brigham, what, you know, he certainly was not responsible even for the greatest number of conversions or baptisms there. But thousands of those English saints who came to Navu, you know, understood him as a significant spiritual leader in their lives and. You know, I think a lot of those bonds of spiritual loyalty, you know, they, they persisted, over the years. And Brigham sometimes, you know, renewed them through his visits to different, , communities, , in the Utah territory. And, you know, there, there were other times where, like you said, he could simply be, belligerent. You know, there's that time in the 1850s that's become known as the Mormon Reformation, where he concluded that, you know, too many people were not living up to the mark. Too many people were unenthusiastic about plural marriage. , in particular, people needed to repent.

And I think very much it is portrayed that way within the church that Jeff Smith was the spiritual leader, and Brigham Young was the temporal leader, in part because I think on some level the church wants to downplay some of his more spiritual contributions, which. how-to-take-over-the_brigham-young-end-notes_ben_wilson-kel3j12t8_cfr_2022-oct-21-1802pm-utc-riverside: The church has, has largely, , moved away from I, I guess, and you're not, you know, a, a Mormon studies guy or an expert on the current church of Jesus Christ, the Latterday Saints. But do you think that what I just said, do you think that's a fair assessment, that the church has moved away from many of his doctrinal contributions? Well, sure. And I, I, I think that is true. And I also think, I also think that it's has become much easier for Latter Day Saints to, if they're looking at parts of the 19th century that. They might not feel so comfortable about today. It's sort of, in a way, it's easier to blame Brigham Young than it is to bring blame the founding prophet. So he's a bit of a safer target, I think for, for criticism. You know, in terms of, yeah, doctrines that the church has moved away from. So Brigham Young identified Adam as humanity's God, the church, the first president explicitly, you know, rejected that viewpoint in the early 19 hundreds. You know, we could look at other examples like blood atonement that Bergham certainly preached. I don't necessarily think the, I don't necessarily think the idea originated with him, , but he preached it forcefully.

And I, I would say the truth. The truth sounds somewhere in between sort of entrepreneur craftsman who. Is doing okay versus, you know, the specter of poverty. So, I mean, I think Brigham Young. Brigham Young does okay as a craftsman. And, you know, he does a lot of different things. So, you know, he can make furniture, he can do windows, , which is something he ends up doing in Kirtland. You know, he moves around a lot. You know, he references, you know, a job in Auburn, which is, you know, by today's standards, a couple of hours east of where he was living in the Rochester area. He, you know, he, so he's sort of para pathetic to use a fancy word. You know, he moves around a lot. He's not, he's not super stable. , he does have this debt that you mentioned, um, about the time of his conversion. You know, his first wife dies, , very sadly, , not too many years into their marriage. I don't, I just don't have the impression that at the age of 30, he's, he was a man on the up, you know, he was sort of doing okay and struggling along, and I see it as most likely he would have continued to do so.

And, you know, it's not as if there isn't a lot of, you know, poverty and deprivation for quite a few years to come. , so I guess to answer your question, yeah, I, I, I don't think he was an entrepreneur who was going to really make it in terms of being, , comfortable and successful. , if he hadn't joined, , the church, I don't, I just don't see a real trajectory. , it, it's interesting to me because, once he gets near leadership, he seems, , Irrepressible almost, is a word I would use. , and you can see that in Missouri where he's sort of semi officially deputized. , Joseph Smith can't give really great instructions because he's in, in jail, in Liberty Jail, but he basically just says, Hey, whoever's the senior apostle, can you kind of make sure that this stuff runs okay. how-to-take-over-the_brigham-young-end-notes_ben_wilson-kel3j12t8_cfr_2022-oct-21-1802pm-utc-riverside: And Brigham just, like runs with that, right? He, he, he seems so anxious for leadership, which is so funny because he, he shows no real anxiety for leadership in the previous, , 30 whatever years of his life. I, I just found odd. Yeah. And you know, there aren't a lot of. Great, , firsthand contemporaneous sources for how he organizes the Exodus from Missouri. There's a few, but it is this interesting moment, like you said, again, it's happenstance. He's a couple of weeks older than Hebrew Kimball, so he ends up in charge when other people have fallen by the, by the wayside really. And so he does, he does show, does show a talent for organizing and working with people both there and, and in England, which, as you say, it's, it's interesting. He hasn't really been in that position previously. I do think he had a lot of spiritual fire and force. You know, I think you can, you can see that at Scattered and Scattered records in the 1830s.

I'll just say we don't know, which is so, uh, well, we do know a lot about the logistics of plural marriage, and in some ways Brigham Young was a special case.

I know, uh, I've heard you say before, like, we just simply don't know. That is not something they were forthcoming about. You can correct me if I'm wrong, , but I don't think that's something we know a lot about, but something we do know more about I was hoping you could speak to is just, you know, when he's got 50 something children, what was the relationship of, of a child to Brigham Young? how-to-take-over-the_brigham-young-end-notes_ben_wilson-kel3j12t8_cfr_2022-oct-21-1802pm-utc-riverside: Was it, was it a normal parent, child relationship?

You know, we do know something about the relationship with some of the children, such as, you know, Brigham Young Jr. There's some very poignant letters, a couple of poignant letters from Brigham to his children. You know, there's one where he's urging a son to come back from the East coast and he, he writes it in his own hand, which is really unusual. Uh, for him. He usually has people do his writing for him. And there are definitely a lot of sources that point to, you know, the family meetings he had with regularity, , for prayer and, and probably for, for other purposes. But those aren't meetings for which we have minutes, unlike many church meetings. So I think, I think we don't know. He, I mean, he clearly didn't have close relationships with most of his children, , just as he didn't maintain close relationships really with most of his wives. , I, I guess I still just, , what does that mean? Not, you know, especially as a wife, he doesn't have a very close relationship, , with her, I imagine. And, and obviously some of them he did, right? Some of his wives, were, were closer than others.

Look at you now . , but it ' s interesting to see that , I guess some of the dynamics are just what you see played out in Brigham Young: other places now in a, in a big family context. A absolutely. And you know, I think Brigham was also, in this case, fairly practical. You know, if a. Was really disaffected or didn't wanna live in the household, he would get her a house elsewhere, you know, maybe, maybe in Provo, maybe, uh, at his farm. , and so I think he knew this wasn't a one size fits all situation. Yeah, I mean, first of all, you know, for somebody with 55 wives, you know, he granted divorces to eight of them. Some of them simply remained in the east, , after they were sealed to him and maybe never even envisioned being part of his household. So there's, you know, there is, there is a sheer variety of circumstance. There are some who. Marry him. Augusta Adams is probably the most prominent example. They marry him and they realize that instead of being a queen, you know, they are one of many and maybe not one of the favored, and they're spend years grasping about it in letters. And, uh, you know, in that case, which I think is really a delicious detail, Brigham Young agrees for Augusta to be sealed to Joseph Smith for eternity, which I, I sort of think he's thinking, well, at least I don't have to spend eternity with her. We'll, we'll give her to Joseph. So, you know, eminently practical. how-to-take-over-the_brigham-young-end-notes_ben_wilson-kel3j12t8_cfr_2022-oct-21-1802pm-utc-riverside: Yes. Yes. Absolutely. Um, I, I, to, to wrap up, one of the things I wanted to ask you, and I'm sorry this is a little bit more of a vague question, but it's just. , what do you see as the essential attributes of Brigham Young? What was it about him that made his personality so singular that made him such a, a strong leader? So I think the first thing, and it wouldn't make him a strong leader if it weren't combined with the other things, is there is that spiritual fire that is there, um, from the moment that he is baptized into the church. Probably even be before that. Um, you know, he is among the early latter day saints who speak in tongues. He is comfortable with that", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/brigham-young", "title": "Brigham Young", "chunk_index": 94, "publication_date": "2022-09-09", "total_chunks_in_doc": 99}}

Um , you know , he is among the early latter day saints who speak in tongues . He is comfortable with that Brigham Young: sort of spiritual ecstasy. It doesn't burn quite as bright or as often later in his life. . But I think at the core, you know, he, he did have that spiritual fire. And then I would say it's his combination of determination and flexibility that, that I mentioned earlier. You know, he, he might introduce an idea, um, such as Adam as humanities, God, and when people opposed it, he sort of shelved it for a while and he brings it back toward the end of his life. Or he introduces the, you know, he clearly has this idea of unity and economic cooperation. That's maybe the most famous example is you, is the United Order sort of this attempt at communitarianism in the 1870s? Well, Brigham has all sorts of setbacks when he tries to introduce that sort of economic unity and he has to pull back from a lot of initiatives. At the same time though, you know, his, his fierce determination along those lines, um, the details might not always work out, but he very much stitches together his people with a sense of, of common purpose and solidarity against outside threats. So I think in, in those respects, you know, that that combination serves him, serves him really well. He's fiercely determined, but he's also willing to be nimble when circumstances necessitated. And I think that also has a lot to do with the fact that he's successful as a leader for a long period of time. And he leads, he leads the church for 33 years after Joseph Smith's death through all sorts of different circumstances, different political threats, different. Times of dissent within the church, the advent of the Transcontinental Railroad and the influx of non-Mormons to the Utah territory. And if he didn't have that flexibility, he wouldn't have been able to succeed for as long as he did. how-to-take-over-the_brigham-young-end-notes_ben_wilson-kel3j12t8_cfr_2022-oct-21-1802pm-utc-riverside: The, the podcast is called How to Take Over.

Well, that is a fun question. , you know, I still, I, I still think there's a tremend. I mean, there's just still a tremendous amount of diversity and ferment within American religion. I, you know, one thing that comes to mind, and this doesn't directly answer the question, but another characteristic of Brigham Young that I think might surprise people is he was really curious. A lot of early latter day Saints were when they were roaming around the United States on missions, or in England, they didn't. A completely single-minded focus on evangelism and proselytizing. They would attend the meetings of other religious societies, not only to make their own case, but just to see what was out there. And Brigham notes doing that on a number of occasions, and you can find that in other, uh, missionary journals from the early 1840s as well. So he, he was someone who was really curious about what was going on in his world and took the time to, to check things at. I think that's not necessarily what I would point to is what made him a great leader, but I think it's something that people wouldn't know about him. You know, I think there have been lots of powerful religious leaders in the United States, uh, since then. You know, people like. And know, ranging from Martin Luther King to Billy Graham, you know, people who have touched, uh, millions of lives, um, and still do, we're never gonna have the exact circumstances that, uh, Brigham Young had, which gave him the opportunity to not just lead a church, but to attempt to establish what he understood as the kingdom of God in a", "metadata": {"episode_url": "https://www.takeoverpod.com/episodes/brigham-young", "title": "Brigham Young", "chunk_index": 96, "publication_date": "2022-09-09", "total_chunks_in_doc": 99}}
